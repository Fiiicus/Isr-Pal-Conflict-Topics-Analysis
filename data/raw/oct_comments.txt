EXACTLY !  That‚Äôs what I need to know also !  How/why/truthfully are they taking over their homes?
Exactly!
Absolute vile human being.
Absolute scum
You realize according to the faith their God was okay with them destroying entire peoples and taking their land right? Like the whole basis is they rolled up on the Caninities and slaughtered them and ripped their unborn children out of the bellies of their pregnant women and dashed them upon the rocks.  The Abrahamic faith is barbaric.  Of course their God and his tenants do little to nothing to curb human cruelty. Its actively encouraged in a lot of parts. The promised land of Israel was literally inhabited when God promised it to the Israelites. This is kind of a reenactment of King David vanquishing the Canaanites in the faith if anything.
Syria is the main source?  What could possibly fix this?!
What do you think satire is?

I guess surviving a genocide just makes you better at getting away with one
Some are real; true believers of Marx, Lenin, Stalin and Mao. Some genuinely believe that the dictatorship of the proletariat, mass graves, and re-education camps are good and necessary. Those are the genuinely scary MFs.
The level of cognitive dissonance is breathtaking! 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free' ? Pearl clutching... Always projection..
&gt;There was no state of Israel before 1948 and that‚Äôs a fact. Obviously there is now and because of that I believe in a two state solution but I know for a fact of a foreign country created a new country where Mexico was (Or Ireland if you‚Äôre from the UK) the west would also fight wars to destroy it.There was also no state of Palestine. I don't think you know the history of Ireland and the UK very well. Who do you think would object through the use of force (other than Mexico) if one of the regions decided it would be better off as its own nation state, speaking an Indigenous language originating from the region and emphasizing the importance of national self-defense and national development?
If China created a communist state bordering the US, vastly socially and politically different to other countries in the region, it would get bombed into the Stone Age. I don‚Äôt know why you think Arab states would react any differently if they had the military capability.
It‚Äôs not a war. It‚Äôs just genocide.

sweaty do u really think if people in neighboring countries are given the chance to fight israel that they instead would behave?   people are aching to make israel suffer as they did to Palestine   Don't underestimate overpopulated Arab countries filled with overzealous people
I agree...this POS was a cook if he served
history is a circle.
5 star D
I'm not saying I excuse Israel or anything, what they're doing is horrible and barbaric but like what do you want to do in this situation unless the US puts boots on he ground and halts everything which is unlikely what would be the best course of action because even if the US backs out of Israel Iran is just foaming at the mouth and that would be worse..people like Mike Johnson will just view this has an act of God
Pls tell me one statement I said that was incorrect. I'm not calling Jews nazi. I'm calling zionist nazi! Many many Jews in Israel will tell you the same thing!Here's a rabbi, maybe you'll listen to himhttps://youtu.be/WSEtuckDbpk?si=Hyd_ChCju2_-Qaqn

‚ÄúMasterful Gambit‚Äùü§ì‚òùÔ∏è
I'm aware but thank you. My point that I was making was that people act as if Hamas exists in a vacuum.
They knew they were going into the tunnels a decade ago thats why they dropped it for the Tavor, another thing the tunnels took from us.
You‚Äôve completely countered your first comment with that one thank you for doing it for me
Oh I know. I detest all religions. If there was no religions we would be a more peaceful people. The same people who cry about Christian fascists in the US are the same ones cozying up to Muslims. I see no difference between Christians and Muslims
Fuck these Israeli cunts
This shit is awful. Netanyahu encourages and allowed this. And this is what fans the fuel of hate. However nothing, and I mean nothing excuses hamas's actions.
Where is the English translation here?
There is only ONE country and that is Palestine..it is currently been occupied by White Colonial Settlers committing genocide in Gaza..#freepalestineGaza is not a prison it is an extermination camp controlled by the white settler colony of israel with the aim of eradicating the native PalestiniansHamas are part of the resistance tactics against white settler colonisation of Palestine.the end goal is to liberate the people and reclaim their land
70% of Gazans are refugees from the Nakba of 1948.
Chibis are the new pin up
If that Hamas leader was hiding in an Israeli apartment building they wouldn't have dreamt of dropping a bomb. They call it the price of war when it's Palestines but wouldn't dare put their own citizens in the same situation. That's how you know it's deliberate genocide.
$10,000,000 a day, every day.
Wars are fought and countries are created all the time. Since 1990 34 New countries have been created. Boo fucking Hoo something happened a century ago.
Mossad will never forget.
Unlikely. These settlers are usually in the West Bank, and there's no Hamas in the West Bank. Of course, that hasn't stopped Israel from murdering several hundred people in the West Bank since the current war began.
Hahahaha source?
So Native Americans can create a new state on US land when they gather enough strength?
Israel hates the Palestinians, and was most likely just waiting for an opportunity. The Hamas terrorist attack was justification to them. Israel would prefer there to be no Palestinians, so rampant bombing make sense in a twisted way.
People smile and get weirded out on camera.  Sometimes that‚Äôs just a nervous reaction or a filler
Yes, it is. But idiots on social media probably don't actually know what it means. That or maybe they genuinely support exterminating the Jews like Hamas wants.
The circle strikes again.
What I take from this video is that Britain is the only one that "won" in the Levant.  They looked at the past 3000 years and said "Yeah, I'm good".
There was a state of Israel, it was destroyed by the Romans. It just took us close to 2000 years to gather enough strength to retake what we lost.
&gt;cut all ties well thaths not happening. israel is the biggest western military outpost in middle east to keep eye over there, basically imperialism...
This is the first ever combat use of the [Arrow anti-ballistic missiles.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_(missile_family\))
I have left-libertarian tendencies and I resent that. This is the "we're anti-imperialist and always side against the West" crowd. Lots of anarchists/anti-imperialists will happily say living under liberalism (small "L") is way better since it means we have the freedom to organize and agitate.
Basically calls for the erasure of the Israeli state and to kill all the Jews, since the ‚Äòriver‚Äô means the Jordan River, and the ‚Äòsea‚Äô is the Mediterranean. In between just so happens to lie the nation of Israel. However, it is a major skill issue if you‚Äôve fought Israel in 4 separate wars and lost all of them lmao

Yeah I feel like this should be the take if you‚Äôre a decent fucking person with mostly good morals. No matter what political side- we should be caring about innocent human life.
the gov supports this by sending the military aswell, if u dont leave then they will bulldoze it
I mean if you're not counting the Italians as the Romans, you can't really count Israel as the same state as the one that existed thousands of years ago.
This isn‚Äôt new, this is what the state of Israel is built on, this is how it was founded. I hope this serves as a wake up call, at least to you‚Ä¶

This sub used to be more than ‚ÄúFuck them up‚Äù and ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt stop bombing Gaza‚Äù. Believe it or not for the most part, this sub used to have pretty civil and relevant discussion pertaining to combat footage being posted. It was really neat hearing people talk and view different types of munitions, weapon systems, fighting tactics, etc. Ever since the start of the Ukrainian conflict it started getting worse and worse. Now with this conflict it stands pretty clear. I‚Äôm upset at the state of the sub and comments being made. It‚Äôs not the same combat footage as it was 5 years ago. RIP

Oh Israel, if only you had kept the galil.
So they steal palestinian homes in the west bank then blow gaza into smithereens and call it self-defense. The west should cut all ties to these nazis and let them fend for themselves before we are dragged into ww3.
Someone tell her her government doesn't care about the hostages since they bombed some of them too
If this is how people feel, then why would Hamas ever release a single hostage
Stalinists and the like. Supposed lefties with entirely right wing values who support authoritarian governments so long as those governments cite or use the iconography of Mao, Lenin, Stalin, or others who claim to support workers while just consolidating power.Fake Marxists, basically.
They did warn everyone to evacuate the north.   The gloves are off and it‚Äôs FAFO o‚Äôclock.
How come Reddit doesn't enforce the user content policy of not making threats/racist remarks to others for that subreddit or reddit in general? Too many posts/comments have been advocating for genocide.
&gt; It also says a lot about how poor Hamas' artillery and drone capabilities are if Israel has been able to just mass tanks so close together without any threat.Not just that, but also Israel's assessment of the threat Hamas is able to pose.
Extreme lefties. Libertarians socialists, anarchists, etc

You just need one worn by the really, really fat guy.
In its most simplest terms, "from river to the sea" just  refers the area containing Israel and Palestine, between the Mediterranean Sea and the Jordan River. The term is often used as part of political statements and slogans under many contexts. The most notable context is calling for the rejection/destruction of Israel and removal of Israelis from the area by Arab factions dating back to Arab-Israeli conflicts in the 60s and is the slogan for groups like Hamas. Other Palestinians and many internationally especially would say it simply meant universal freedom and equality for Palestinians living in their homelands. The term is also used by Israel's Likud party in their original party document to claim all of the area as Israel land. So yeah overall, there are one-state connations.
&gt;Current modern US Army doctrine though calls for dispersed tactical assembly areas. The war in Ukraine has demonstrated a couple of times why. Russia hit one of Ukraine's training compounds to great effect, despite it being on the other side of the country. Ukraine felt they were safe there, concentrated men in the area, and didn't enforce strict opsec so fresh influx from all around the world were using their phones at will, and paid the price.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yavoriv_military_base_attack
Remembering that Israel enjoys this is making me  sick to my stomach.
Don't they have enough fucking problems in Yemen already?

The secular Israeli's hate these guys more than you'd guess. Fuck these guys. Impediment to peace, and are increasingly getting a grip on the Israeli government. The more religion is introduced into government, no matter the religion, the worse it is.
In America, people brag about gun rights and self defense. Anyone who comes to their homes with the intention to steal and cause violence is shot on sight and their death is justified but that right does not extend to Palestinians in their homeland. An American Zionist who has no connection to Palestine can break into a Palestinian home and claim it for themselves but God forbid if he fights back his death will be justified and the western media will not hesitate to call him a terrorism.

ZioNazi*
I wonder if that family joined Hamas afterward.
They wrote the bible..   EditThe Old Testament is largely based on the Hebrew Bible, which is a collection of writings by Ancient Israelites.
Welcome to religion!
Hoe the fuck was it self-defence anyway? How does an occupier defend himself against the people it oppresses??
That's not accurate. The Director of the Indonesia Hospital (the hospital closest to the camp) claims as of 10:25PM GMT (an hour ago) that 50+ are dead. The Interior Ministry claims there have been 400+ casualties, however casualties means "dead or injured". That could be where the confusion is coming from.
Stupid references by the way, definitely swallowing only confirmation bias 'media'
How many have Israel killed since? Will they stop? That bomb today for one Hamas and numerous civilians. Will settlers stop invading palestinians houses while they are told to go elsewhere? Forget eye for eye, they are taking their entire body and SOUL.

THEY ARE INSANE
But did they have their fingers crossed behind their backs?
I don't want to see any civilians harmed.  And I despise the fact that he Israeli government is using the attack as an excuse to wipe the Palestinians off the globe.  It's basically an extermination campaign and too many western countries are cheering them on.
What the hell is really going on over there??
Israelis have been seen literally dragging dead Palestinian corpses.
Because always saying "500+ dead" after every single bombing, just for reality to be less than 100 is disingenuous, bad faith, and frankly comedic. The point of propaganda is to be subtle. I don't know why people are always setting themselves up to be laughed at by being proven that their reports are greatly exaggerated for shock value. Why not read sources that have knowledge about the situation, then link the sources? I feel sorry about it. I understand you're devastated about the situation, but your message is being ignored when they look like they belong in a PornHub ad banner.
Ethnic cleansing, collective punishment
With the euphemism translated, it means: "from the Jordan river to the Mediterranean sea, the land will be [Jew-free.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Judenfrei)" In its current use, it is a call for genocide.
Israelis can literally call for the murder of millions, god forbid Palestinians ask for a ceasefire or not to be killed, that‚Äôs antisemitism.
Exactly, the blockade on Gaza has been there for about 17 years. Most of Hamas that attacked were born into this concentration camp. Of course they‚Äôre going to resist‚Ä¶.
That's reinforced what I said dude? Are you misreading what I said?
Where are the jews in Israel who doesn‚Äôt think like her?
It not a Christian anything ..it's a Jewish thing...you dope
That is true and I made no effort to defend what's happening in this video.
Answered one genocide with another. That's their solution to this conflict.
Yup. This was happening way befre the recent events. This and worse.
So it‚Äôs basically a shitty Israeli attempt at genocide? Alright buddy. Maybe Israel should ask Assad how to genocide people, don‚Äôt remember him being called out for it.Edit: by ‚Äúwrong‚Äù I‚Äôve meant making mistakes, Israel usually tried to avoid mistakes. Didn‚Äôt say Israel never did anything morally wrong.
I disagree with you.They are not sociopaths, just psicopaths...
In a nutshell yes. But these are the zionists and not the majority of jews. Many jews are openly opposed to Israel zionism and showing the world, particularly in the US, it is ok to criticise Israel, bless them.
You can not approve of Hamas‚Äô tactics and still understand what pushes toward such radicalism
Lol seriously, people support whatever propaganda hypes their own preconceived narrative... even the Health Ministry in Gaza (an organ of Hamas) states that 50 were killed in Jabalia (which is where this video is showing). [Source](https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2023/10/31/photos-dozens-killed-in-israeli-air-attack-on-jabalia-refugee-camp-in-gaza)
Nobody said Russia was a humanitarian paradise, genius, they simply outlined a historical geopolitical reality which is honestly quite unflattering to the US.   The US could recoup much of that lost prestige simply by undoing some of its own misconduct in this arena. Such as by immediately withdrawing all military aid and enacting an embargo of military equipment to Israel, to at least the extent we blockaded Cuba.
Everything you‚Äôve said so far has been false, genocide, Israel‚Äôs intentions etc.You‚Äôre just going to continue making up things to fit your narrative, if Israel wanted, they would‚Äôve already wiped everyone out. Things is, Israel doesn‚Äôt want those things, Israel had multiple different governments and none of them aimed to kill anyone just for the sake of killing.
The fact that bombed 15-20 residential refugee buildings because they thought their might have been a Hamas commander somewhere in the suburb is *insane*. They've even done press releases where their spokesperson said they weren't sure about the existence of the commander or any Hamas tunnels here.
Zionists want to create an ethno-state; this has nothing to do with religion. They claim the Bible says god gave them the land. However hardly any jews care about this. Zionists use this hasbara to gain support from the american christian evangelists‚Ä¶ sadly this is a regular occurrence in the west bank
&gt;Hamas, wants Israel completely whiped off the map. So long as Hamas exists there cannot be a two state solution.That is either a lie or a foolish parroting of propaganda, but it is entirely wrong.  Hamas has revised their charter several times, and the most current revision, the 2017 charter, calls for a two-state solution.   Let's see what kind of wrong you are, are you the kind that learned something today or are you the kind who can't figure out what it means that Hamas, far from holding the position you accused them of, actually wants an equitable two state solution?  Read it for yourself right here.  [https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hamas-2017-document-full](https://www.middleeasteye.net/news/hamas-2017-document-full)
Tell me 1 thing that is incorrect about my post. I'll be waiting ü•±. Zionist Nazi Israel is recognized by 18 nations as an Apartheid slavery state and guilty of war crimes against humanity.  If the Jews in Israel don't get rid of the Zionist soon, and the Zionist actually complete there genocide and ethnic cleansing. Isreal will likely be fucked by the rest of world. I feel bad for all my Jewish friends who will likely get harassed here in america due the actions of the terrorist zionists regime currently controlling Israel.

Hamas didn't shoot a rocket at these people. They kidnapped and murdered people at a music festival. You can be Pro-Palestine and still against the actions of Hamas on Oct 7th. In fact, you *should* be against those actions because they guaranteed that many Palestinian civilians would die. Hamas doesn't care about Palestinians.

Is this supposed to be a justification?  Do you expect anyone to be like "oh, well, they're mad? I guess they can genocide."Would you accept that justification if someone said "people keep forgetting how mad Hamas was?"  Would you say Hamas was justified if someone pointed out the land stolen from Palestinians and told you Israel had killed tens of thousands Palestinian civilians?Why would you expect anyone to think that what you said justifies what this pro-genocide soldier is saying?

It's crazy that these people can freely say they want to exterminate all the Palestinians, and it's all fine.I think i just don't get more shocked because I'm from Brazil, and police here kills black people just like that. People approve that because they say "Those are thugs". Just like in this war saying "we are targeting terrorists". Genocides always have a lie for justification and hide the real purpose, which is ethnic cleansing.
Funny, that. But that‚Äôs just another coincidental coincidence‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..
Hamas tried to give two hostages back, no strings attached, for humanitarian reasons.  Israel refused.  They ended up handing them over to Red Crescent.The US tried to get Israel to hold off on the ground invasion and try to enter talks to free the hostages.  Israel, again, refused.The hostages and the initial attack are Israel's pretext for invasion.

That the IDF reaction is evil as well doesn‚Äôt negate that fact. And just to clarify the stance because so people don‚Äôt get it confused - Israeli policies have been oppressive, the reaction to the attacks of have been excessive, and there are war crimes being committed.  Both are bad. That was the point. It

X to doubt..Like it or not Israel has the support of most of the west. The US proposed sending Israel an additional 14 billion in military aid yesterday - hardly what I‚Äôd consider pariah status, or anywhere near it.
Forced evictions supported by the Israeli state that the Israeli supreme Court have "generally"(idk about this specific instance) as Illegal. This is done by far right settlers to increase a Jewish presence in key areas that are important to them (Hebron + Jerusalem are the main ones) so that in future peace deals, they can secure these neighbourhoods for Israelis.
Yup pretty fucking horrible, context for this post is what I‚Äôm talking about.
100% of people who are upset about Israel bombing a refugee camp would agree.  Your whataboutism failed.
The translation is 100 % accurate
Virtually bro virtually. 100 men 1 woman 1 child. Also why are those people in north Gaza right by the border vs being in south Gaza‚Äôs where all the humanitarian supplies are?
Then imagine the anger on the other side, enduring 70+ years of settler colonial apartheid with the world‚Äôs approval
No they can‚Äôt. They don‚Äôt have the skill.Let me explain:If they had the skill, they could garner international favor by simply sending in their premier HR/CT force, and dismantling Hamas.  But that comes with risks, and gets riskier the less skill you have. They couldn‚Äôt even target discriminate during initial response. If they did anything other than what they are doing now, they‚Äôd be exposed for the unskilled cowards they are in front of the entire world. It would also require them to stop stealing homes to prevent further radicalization of the people they have living under apartheid. Which they will not do because they believe what they are doing is justified.There‚Äôs no excuse for what they‚Äôre doing. Other than weakness. Anyone can push a button.
My guess:  They weren't trying to kill one person.   This is exactly what they were going for.
They dont know what they are shooting they could be killing their own hostages they do it just because their daddy ntinyaho is telling them
Yea, I'm sure all those kids they killed will think twice about attacking Israel, again.
It‚Äôs basic human nature. Religion is an excuse, a symptom. we‚Äôve always had deplorable xenophobic violent tendencies within us. Religion sure does grease the wheels though.
"Give us time, we're still looking for something to justify this"
No, you are just racist AF and I called you put for it. Also I'm a small town white dude lol.
Wasn‚Äôt this exactly what Hilter wanted to do with all the Jews during the holocaust?If this is truly a mainstream Israeli mindset, wouldn‚Äôt this be like America is working with the Nazis this time?
They‚Äôve all been deleted by the mods probably. Half the comments have been deleted/removed.
Yeah I remember this guy from an older video where he was speaking at the university of Waterloo about the same thing.
What is being said about Islam is a bunch of haters that script twist it and lie about it hence why people attack Islam and true Muslims but yeah when fake Muslims like ISIS for example act like they are following Islam when they're not people attack Islam thinking that's what it says but again that's because people are ignorant racists and don't bother checking what the Quran really says.You yourself just quoted a verse out of context.On the other hand the verses I mentioned are in your books, it's a fact, I didn't script twist or lie or manipulate anything, it's what it says, it's how it is so no I'm not being "antisemitic" this has nothing to do with that. BTW Satanyahu quoted the Samuel verse so I don't what you on about and there is a video of a Jew (don't know if he's a Zionist or not) saying yeah our God tells us that and they actually believe it's God telling them to do such crazy acts.And the Zionists totally believe they can do this besides believing they have to right to steal and murder Palestinians, so yeah I'm anti Zionist call me that and your books do have some very distubing and crazy verses that are clearly not from the real God and I'm shocked how people follow it.If their supposed God tells them they can do this and they do it then you blame both their religion and themselves which is why I did what I did above.
What's the context here?
these people suck
Israelis are angry! He is not right, but you people keep judging them forgetting this terrorists brutally murderded 1,400 innocent victims! For gods sake!
Just about any excuse to kill as many innocent people as possible, why because the world says, ‚Äúgo for it‚Äù
It helps explain why they were filming that exact structure at that exact moment, while speaking in Arabic
Monsters. Straight up monsters.
Why did the Jews in the Warsaw ghetto fight back. Didn't they know to follow orders?
Because there is a huge, huge difference between 1) targeting enemy combatants and happening to also kill nearby civilian (what Israeli does) and 2) planning to specifically seek out and target unarmed civilians over combatants (what Hamas, ISIS, Al-Qaeda does). It's a massive moral difference and distinction. I don't blame route #1 as it is what has to be done in every war and even in a defensive war. I massively blame anyone going route #2.  If Israeli had the same approach and morals of Hamas there would have been 1+ million casualties in the first few days. Israeli easily has the weapons to wipe out all Palestinians in Gaza (what Hamas has promised to do to all Jews in Israel) but is obviously holding back 99+% of their firepower to instead selectively pick a few targets. Yes, it will still look brutal, and yes civilians will always die no matter how selective you try to be in ultra dense urban warfare. But if the tables were turned Hamas would gleefully slaughter every Jew in Israel.
The scene in this video is reminiscent of what happened on the Night of the Broken Glass, but it seems that horrific time has escaped the memory of the colonizers seen here.
100%. Thanks for reminding me this existed.
Only 65 comments? Why aren't the pro Israel brigade here? I would like to see them defend this one.
Anybody that doubts Netanyahu's administration had forward knowledge and let their citizens die for war justification is also fooling themselves. The blood of those Israelis is jut as much on their hands.
It‚Äôs not antisemitic if the leader of Israel is referencing it now, is it? Y‚Äôall are desperate to justify this shit and it is pretty gross. What they are doing is completely wrong and if Israel doesn‚Äôt want scrutiny on their holy book, they oughtnt reference the psychotic shit in it in the context of dropping bombs on civilians.
What terrible people to celebrate the suffering of others
Its a rallying call for the extinction of Israel, the utter erasure of it and its people. Some try to claim that its just a rallying call for the creation of a proper Palestinian state, but its 100% genocidal rhetoric.
sounds pretty idealistic to me bruh you're 'all-lives-matter'ing it
Hmmm I think it‚Äôs clearly referring to the idea that the north should be free from the Humber river to the Irish Sea.Though it could also be a call to make Yorkshire‚Äôs borders the Humber river and to remove Lancashire from existence to create a sea.
How has this bloodshed not been stopped already. How many innocent have to be killed before it would be considered enough?
*screams in Australian*
&gt;None of this stuff was happening on October 6th...wonder why....just cuz u said so, right? lmao. this shit has been happening for the last 75 years that Israel has been illegaly occupying that land. ive lost count of how many bombings just like this one have took place since i learned about the conflict more than 10 years ago. so dont be dumb, information is everywhere, just search for it before talking shit online.
Because they target civilians first and foremost.It is one thing to target enemy military and have civilian casualties, and another to target the civilians directly.It is one thing to bomb a residential building that has rockets on the roof and an armory on the third floor, and another to fire rockets blindly into a city hoping to hit some apartments.
Israel has been dealing with drones for years has plenty of tech for taking them out - which is one of the reasons it's been a shame that Israel hasn't engaged with that conflict: which is still find odd because that conflict is the world's best military tech demo waiting to happen for anybody willing to grab the opportunity, lots of export orders on the table.
Do we really know who did this? Maybe Hamas did this too, like all the hospitals... /S üôàü§°ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Nazis literally did this, now zionazis are doing it.  Sad.
Add that to the ever growing war crimes list that the zionists are making that will no doubt be swept under the rug by the US because they cant lose their control on the middle eastüôÑ cant wait for the israeli government to claim that the car had a hamas member to justify blowing it up
I don‚Äôt understand the protests. We all want the violence to stop but is the solution allowing Hamas to have its own state of power? I‚Äôm genuinely curious. Everyone just says free Palestine and google it. Can anyone articulate a solution? Hamas would overwhelmingly win a fair election and idk any country in the world that would allow religious fundamentalist terrorists to exist Nextdoor
We're still on approval only so there isn't a major concern in regards to posts right now, it's primarily in regards to comments most instances occur.Very few posts are locked, less than a handful as far as I remember. I believe one instance where we locked a thread was after the claimed hospital attack where there just weren't much to go on initially.
There are quite a few yards and warehouses in Budyonivskyi district.47.964542, 37.864799Hopefully, recon found some juicy targets.
War machine must march on
If you would see this lady in the street, you would probably say "that woman seems like a Enlightened person". It is so easy to hate and lose total faith in people or any kind communal future in these times.
Yeah right. No one with a brain believes these lies anymore. Y‚Äôall claimed Israel bombed a hospital and killed 500+ then we found out it was a Palestinian Jihad rocket that only damaged the parking lot. The hospital is STILL standing. 500 dead my ass. üôÑ
Btw this guy is at minimum a terrorist supporter. So don‚Äôt listen to a word he says. Or he‚Äôs just a troll bot, but he literally admitted to giving money to Hamas on another thread. People like you are why there is so much Islamophobia. Using religion to justify genocide. Your disgusting. Israel will win. They aren‚Äôt going anywhere. The entire west stands behind them. You have China Russia and Iran behind you. You will not win this.
Hamas fighter with a lot of swagger at 0:29 had a bad day. Do not pass go, do not collect 72 virgins.
It's okay they'll spam a bunch of recycled stories soon on all social media as their students are taught to do
Whether they expected it or not is a moot  point. The ones who press the button and the ones ordering it have shown how barbaric they're willing to be to 'defend' (Orwellian) their zionist colonial settler outpost.The fact that they have no regard for any human life (hannibal directive) and they're aims to force the Palestinians to the sinai desert show they only value the land. The cruelty is entirely the point.Edit: formatting

Remember when reddit accidentally posted that their 5th highest ranked city for reddit user activity was Eglin Air Force base?https://web.archive.org/web/20160410083943/http://www.redditblog.com/2013/05/get-ready-for-global-reddit-meetup-day.html?m=1
Is anyone surprised that the Gaza never runs out of terrorists? Im not. Look at what Israel is doing.
Israel literally funded Hamas to oppose the existing secular political entities in Palestine at the time. Hamas is good for Israeli propaganda.
Yea I went and did a little google deep dive on it after you commented and it looks like the front line combat troops did not like the Tavor and they all got reissued M4's. They are now just being used by support troops according to members of the IDF who post here on Reddit.
There was a guy outside my university library handing out leaflets for like a meeting or discussion or whatever on Palestine and watching him trying to sound pro Palestine and also not accidentally sound pro Hamas was a little fun
Modern day nazis
For decades now the environmentalists have been chanting, "bulldoze the suburbs!"Who would have thought the IDF could combine a military operation with restoration of the natural landscape.
They win a battle allah akbar. They are losing terribly allah akbar.Does Arabic need more words?
Israel did this when they could've just phoned the US where we have smart, high speed rockets that just throw out blades to kill one person?Like they have the tools, and it would've been smarter optically to do so? Are we at the "Death of a Euphemism" stage of the conflict where they don't even have to pretend to feign apologia? No more I guess.
I guess what I should ask is please explain how my comment was a strawman argument
Because it sounds nice in English if you don't put much thought into it.The original Arabic version was "Water to water: Palestine will be Arab"Even in the gentlest interpretation, it's certainly not vouching for the two state solution.
I'm not familiar with the Apache's MFDs, but the only thing I can think of that might be a security issue is lasing code. I don't see how range to target, time for impact, heading etc could benefit the enemy.
Sounds like something Seth would say
Bulldozer goes through, forms a nice berm, and the troops have shelter where none may have existed.Also new road.
Sometimes a comment is just so stupid it makes me laugh out loud thank you. Imagining some ugly person typing out that movies (cave wall illuminations) are important really got my ribs tickling thank you
They learned from the best
My time in Israel was eye opening. The racism and hatred toward the Palestinians was gross and disgusting. I‚Äôm sorry; no matter what the Israeli propaganda says, Israel is an apartheid state and evil.
Ah fair enough well I hope so man
not germans, nazis‚Ä¶
Ah yes, trying to justify an action of few and punishing over 2m people.
Jesus Christ.
I'm a staunch liberal democrat. I voted for my party in every election going back to the 1990's. But I absolutely HATE the condoning and funding of genocide against the Palestinian people. It was their f'ing country, not the Israelis. Israelis are the real terrorists and Palestine and Hamas are just protecting what little land and dignity they have left. Sure the actions of Hamas are atrocious but I guarantee anyone would do the same if foreigners planted themselves on their land and forced them out with violence.
Step 1:  Don't bomb hospitals.
How many movies have you made? Because he's not just an actor, but also a writer and producer. That's not easy. Calling someone stupid is easy.
The Nazis are back baby!
It lets the crew know that the hellfire seeker is tracking the target. The time of flight of the missile suggests this is approximately 8km from target. Also, it looks as though it may be being designated by another platform or maybe even from the ground due to the lack of the lasing symbol
They can excel *if properly supported by infantry*. Couple of my mentors before I joined the Corps were tankers in Iraq, and they absolutely dragged their tracked balls across the insurgents‚Äô faces repeatedly, because they worked in tandem with infantry units. Insurgents strong-point a house? Tank puts a fucking main-gun round through a window or two and brings the house down. Dudes on rooftops with RPGs? Infantry domes them before they can line up on the armor.    It can be a comically-lethal symbiotic relationship if done right. The fucking Soviets gaggle-fucking around Ukraine are not a good example of combined-arms operations.    Edit: one guy told me how he was escorting a patrol and they took fire from a single sniper. As the tank commander, he had his gunner send a main-gun round through the window the sniper used.  This ended the sniper, and the rest of the patrol was completely unmolested, because who the fuck wants to potshot someone whose response is going to be to fire a fucking tank at you? That‚Äôs not fun.
I was waiting for the sha-ger :(
Your using a lot of words to say you believe Muslims should kill all the Jews and believe that out of choice.Your trying to preach one religion and ask why other religions don't believe what they say even if you don't believe what these books sayIt's like saying you believe the world is flat and ask people that believe the world is round why they believe the world is flat, they just don'tYour word washing starts as a question but ask nothing, you're just spreading words of hate and violence
Leisurely unloading your car and wishing death on all Palestinians while they scramble for life everyday for decades. This level of privilege is perverse.
If you can provide a source other than Hamas (Gaza health ministry) for those numbers, I‚Äôd be glad to consider them. For now though, I wouldn‚Äôt hold any weight to their self assessed death tolls. Even if they were accurate, 10,000 is actually a relatively low number when you take a look at other recent conflicts in the MENA region.
I'm in the US and I support pursuing and killing terrorists, as most people would. In this case what Hamas did was brutal and depraved. They also had to know what it would trigger. So here's what I don't get... Why do Palestinian leaders not denounce and help eject Hamas? My current understanding is that Israel wants the monsters who attacked and killed so many innocent civilians but Palestine protects, shelters and aids them. If Palestine rejected Hamas this is over right? And since they won't then they are essentially aligning with Hamas. Looking for information and facts here.  Edit: Hey I'm sharing a take and looking for info to better understand this. Down votes don't aid in that. I could care less about Karma but if you disagree with what I stated please inform and help educate. Down voting without commenting makes me think I probably do have an accurate understanding and people are just being tribal.

This is how you turn people into terrorists.

Finally I‚Äôm seeing people see this view , israel was shitty for how they treated them and the segregation they made with Palestine which is what made sense for them to retaliate against Israel, if they stuck to military bases and police outposts only, then maybe that would‚Äôve been more justified but massacring and enjoying killing thousands of people that literally had no idea what was going on behind the shadows , that‚Äôs where they lost my sympathy too
Antisemite spotted. Why still not in an active fight shoulder to shoulder with your brethren, habibi? 1000lb bombs scare you much?

There‚Äôs literally a woman and a child being carried away from the rubble‚Ä¶
If a civilian structure/structure with civies around is used for military reasons (I.e. storing ammo, troops) it DOES NOT make it an illegal target. It‚Äôs otherwise: a hospital that is used as a storefront for an ammo dump becomes a legal target. All in accordance to the international law.

Wolverines!*Red Dawn* is the only 1984 disinformation I acknowledge in this subreddit.

You wanna take it there? lets take it there I don't have any problem with that because you have no idea what the Quran says.BTW the verse you quoted is out of context (as usual):Surah 2:190 - 191Fight in the cause of Allah ÀπonlyÀ∫ against those who wage war against you, but do not exceed the limits. Allah does not like transgressors. Kill them wherever you come upon them and drive them out of the places from which they have driven you out. For persecution is far worse than killing. And do not fight them at the Sacred Mosque unless they attack you there. If they do so, then fight them‚Äîthat is the reward of the disbelievers.(It speaks of the disbelievers that were attacking Muslims only, the Quran never says to kill disbelievers just for being disbelievers).Surah 3:151We will cast horror into the hearts of the disbelievers for associating Àπfalse godsÀ∫ with Allah‚Äîa practice He has never authorized. The Fire will be their home‚Äîwhat an evil place for the wrongdoers to stay!(Allah here is speaking of how he will deal with the disbelievers that associate with false gods, promising them fear and hellfire).This is what Allah tells us in regards to non Muslims that are not harming us:Surah 60:8 - 9As for those who did not fight you because of your faith, nor expelled you from your homes: Allah does not prohibit you from dealing kindly and equitably with them. Allah loves the equitable. But Allah prohibits you from befriending those who fought against you over your faith, expelled you from your homes, or aided in your expulsion. Whoever befriends them: these are the wrongdoers.The Quran is nothing like the Old Testament and the Bible, that tell you directly with context to go do those crazy things.There isn't one single verse or hadeeth that says kill a child or a woman, actually these are the commands of war in Islam:1. Don't cut a tree.2. Don't kill a child.3. Don't kill old people.4. Don't destroy a temple or a church.5. Don't destroy a building.6. Don't kill those who surrender.7. Don't kill who ran away.8. Don't kill a woman.9. Don't kill a sick person.10. Don't kill a monk or a priest.11. Don't disfigure the dead.12. Don't kill an animal except for eating.13. Be good to the prisoners and feed them.14. Don't enforce Islam.
Ex‚Ä¶.safe house.
Where are the Hamas terrorists?
It‚Äôs very entertaining debating with someone who just recently learned about the conflict a month ago and watching their head spin when your bring up the million wars that were had in the region with the sole intent of genociding all of the Jews in Israel and then getting the ‚Äúwell bombing civilians isnt ok #free-palestine‚Äù
Scum
Yeah, uncommon Hamas L. They know their sympathizers are ok with jew killings, but somehow forgot animal cruelty is haram. They‚Äôll have to fire their PR manager.Very much /s
A lot of the videos were combat engineers.  We use m4s
Oh, thank god, perhaps they can do like Pepsi and solve the crisis with a large two-topping pizza
Wars go both ways. If you let someone launch an attack or counterattack from your home be prepared for incoming. ‚ÄúOh you must support Israel‚Äù no both teams are shit.
Pretty crazy that they even roof knocked for that building.
I mean the israeli footage is posted from one source. Its the same source that has hebrew text at the bottom in a thick font. Sure, the israeli propaganda page, or are you saying there need to be more posts from hamas firing rockets? Arguably r/worldnews is also pro israel, while r/therewasanattempt is a palestinian propaganda page right now. People pick sides, whats new?
This happens daily in the West Bank. This is the stuff you won't see in western media, especially in the US.
Gotta have the new neighborhood looking good
God always conveniently believes in exactly what the person invoking god believes in. Same gimmick  as the Founding Fathers, they're not gonna show up to object so you can just say they agree with you to bolster your argument.

All governments are responsible for their people, it is not Israel‚Äôs problem Hamas don‚Äôt care for their people.   The deaths that happen are a direct result of Hamas.  It‚Äôs sad but it is what it is.   Those people elected them, they stand for them and they will unfortunately perish for them.   I wish there was another way but Hamas leadership is dying on genocide only.
He is a pig
Utter cretins
Baby Killer Biden. Genocide Joe
As a Jew, it's felt a lot like "you will be resettled to work in the east" vibe.
True that its a vicious cycle of hatred and violence that will continue for decades
Pretty much
There are literally thousands of videos of injured women and children. So many kids have been killed because of the bombing. I saw a video where they only found two legs of a child. The body was stuck under the rubble
Is it that much more weird than a term like "Bouncing Betty" becoming common usage?
There is the Mossad for that
If the power dynamics shift, it won‚Äôt just be the Arab world, the Muslim world will remember their behavior and make them experience the same careless destruction they showed the Palestinians.Israel has set itself up for at least a century of intense hatred from all of its neighbors.I wonder if these immoral genocide supporters will be spouting ‚Äúfuck around and find out‚Äù then.RIP to all the innocents lost because of Zionism.
They do have antitank weapons, RPGs, and mortars, as well, as mines and IEDs.  They also have drones with HE munitions.  No idea in what quantities for any of that.  Ether way, unlike Russian military, IDF values the lives of their soldiers.  Their troops are trained, prepared, and they know exactly what they‚Äôre fighting for.  F*k Russia, f*k Hamas.   Good hunting and Godspeed, IDF.
Correct.I totally forgot how echo friendly these crazies can be, forgot they can go psychopathic about it sometimes you know like having extreme OSD or something of the likes or maybe they're just worried about America's economy you know trying their best to be cost efficient.I mean yeah if you think about it trying to wipe out 2.2 million humans from existence they got to calculate this wisely and after that they still will need to consider expanding the land that Santa Clause promised them building new cities on top of the dead and what not.Fucking scum of earth.

wtf is a suicidevest gonna do against a tank?
**"...a desperate attempt to play the victim."** while simultaneously victimizing another population of civilians. Turns out the "Never Again" slogan meant this will never again happen to us, but we reserve the right to ignore this slogan with respect to our own actions.
Not a civilian area though when a terrorist grouping uses it as a base. Notice most in that video are men, men of fighting age. There are virtually no women and children.

*HOUND*
What a fucking psycho
Of course Isreal was the victim on October 7th however the way they are killing so many innocent bystanders and creating so much damage to the strip, the end game will only bring on  more hate of Jews by most muslims and any other human being who cares about life. Just think of all the Palestinians who have lost everything and have no reason to live. How many more thousands of ‚ÄúHamas ‚Äú type terrorists do you think are being created every time another bomb drops. I only see things getting worse for all Jews worldwide. If the end goal is to eliminate Hamas, I‚Äôm afraid Isreal will only create a bigger monster which will continuously try to eliminate the race from the face of the earth ‚òπÔ∏è
Not randomly, they are targeting highly concentrated areas to make better use of their bombs.It takes a lot of bombs to kill millions of people, and they are being eco-friendly doing this way.
WoW!!
Believe it or not, this is not degraded at all. It's just specially designed for Jewish eyes and is performing at peak levels.
Zionist-Ashkenazi Jew-imposters that's what they are ...
I don't give a fuck what side you're on. If you can genuinely look at this and think "Yeah, that's justified." you're a monster. The must recent update from Indonesia Hospital claims *at the very least* there's 50 dead and over 400 injured.
Since when were the IDF and Zionists "respected"? they have been doing the exact same things you see now since 1947.
My Lord
To say it‚Äôs a bad look is a massive understatement. Israel is on the trajectory of a pariah state.
What‚Äôs your solution?
They are not "harboring" anyone. Nobody is allowed to leave. Gaza a strip is a concentration camp enclosed by gates on all sides and then sea on one side which is blockaded by Israeli forces. The fences are lined with remote turrets and if anyone gets within 50 ft of a fence, you're instantly shot or sniped.  Palestinians aren't harboring Hamas in the Gaza strip. Hamas were born in that prison concentration camp that they call the gaza strip and had never been allowed to leave and is only being used as a scapegoat that justify genocide and ethnic cleansing and a concentration camp the same as the Nazis did to them. The nazi Jew gov refused to take back 50 hostages in exchange for hospital fuel So they're mass genocide stays justified. and they are going to kill their own citizens along with the Palestinians. The Nazi Zionist regime needs to be eradicated!
Except they are not that interested in leaving anything standing.
Murder Death Kill :)
Zionist = Nazi Jew. Isreal has turned into a nazi state run by the zionist nazi Jew. It's an Apartheid state that is operating the largest concentration camp (Gaza strip) the world has ever seen. Are hamas terrorists? I asked myself when were they created why were they created and how? Hamas first showed up in the 90s so that's the when of it. Why were they created in the 90s, where were they in 1947 when isreal was recognized as a state. That's easy one too. In 1948, zionist nazi Jews enacted a horrible act of genocide and slavery called the naqba. During the naqba, nazi Jews murdered 10 of thousands of innocent Palestinians women and children forcing them out of there homes that they've lived in for generations, then hurded them to Gaza strip where they were locked in and blockaded. There, the nazi Jew government implemented a system of apartheid all across Israel and didn't allow food, water, or electricity in the concentration camp, starving people to death. After decades of this treatment, a group was created within the walls of the concentration camp to resist apartheid and slavery. That group was Hamas. I wonder if they still will be seen as a terrorist organization decades from now? Same as Mandela was labeled a terrorist by Margaret Thatcher and Reagan for resisting apartheid. How is Mandela seen now? He is regarded as hero by the entire world! The same might become apparent years from now, that a group that is being labeled as terrorists now might actually come to light as just being a group who tried to stop genocide and ethnic cleansing.
Especially in this war they're being an open book because the public is furious at the unprofessionalism of letting Hamas to Israel. And since everything is translated and IDF wants to show strength to the Israelis they are unlikely to like in order to diminish their actions, they have full backing after all
To kill one person? what person? there is literally no one there specific, they just randomly bomb locations.
Holy downscaling, Batman!
Thats as clear a message can be
Candace Owens lite right here
I heard in one of the interviews that Israel made some promises to Qatar to not wack the Hamas big wigs while they‚Äôre chilling in Qatar.
Certainly not cluster bombs.  First, it's too far from the front line. Second, Ukraine does not use them in residential areas.  And third, the sounds are very similar to secondary explosions from weapons depots.  I also watched other videos today that wagons with fuel were hit in Donetsk.  There may have been ammunition wagons as well, or they may have been two separate destinations. No matter what is the case it's a good news. –°–ª–∞–≤–∞ –£–∫—Ä–∞–∏–Ω–µ

Absolutely atrocious what these people are doing to the Palestinian civilians. They have enough resources and firepower, and advance technology that they could take out the HVT without killing civilians. But they choose to drop bombs. It‚Äôs so they can have an excuse to community genocide. Sad how the IDF and Zionists went from being respected to utter pieces of trash over the past 50 years.
&gt; about things they have no understanding ofFind it depressing in my country (UK), that people are putting so much energy into this, its frustrating as firstly people know nothing about this issue and "raising awareness" and protesting far from the region is going to change nothing. This dreadful and horrific violence will continue for many years to come.Meanwhile people couldn't care less about half the issues my country currently faces. It annoys me we get distracted on trivial issues which we can do little about or are not important.
USA and Europe are creating citizens who have effectively lost faith in the faithless government by funding this genocide so blatantly. Was this their mission or?
'There could be infrastructure, tunnels... we're still looking into it' - so they bombed without any real intel on what they were dropping on?
You need at least sixteen pigs to finish the job in one sitting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm. They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes, no matter what religion or ethnicity.
I don't understand the language but i'd wager he didn't say 'over and out' as those two words mean two different things.  Unless he was expecting a response from someone he would have said just said 'out'
is indiscriminate war crimes combat footage?
Nazis did this for a long time
Im not an ah64 pilot. Nor a weapon expert. But I think the crosshair represent the tracking. Hellfire is laser guided. The crosshair don't show up in this clip. So it might be another person/helicopter that is lasingThe solid outline is that the missle have a "view" of the target. While the dashed is the runner up hellfire.Yea. The missle if really accurate
Id assume something like this the planhttps://youtu.be/_QPUmZ9XsR8?si=ZDlDmIaBIpUIdyl3Instead of going door to door, they are going to use tanks to blast buildings clear of occupants...but idk...not my expertise and I have no idea what this war is going to look like.
The Nazis did the same thing to a group of people a while back. The bullied become the bullies.
in all honesty this is just a video, they kill kids and civilians all day long and should not be trusted.  they steal land, houses and kill their journalists.
Marines, ready for action
That hit
Because Israel didn't claim 500 dead in a hamas missile misfire.

On the other hand, tanks are notoriously bad at infiltrating underground tunnels.
I m too. World news admins are high on israel , freedom of speech my ass
Yeah, it's basically the best friend of the US amongst a bunch of oil producing countries who don't really like the US that much. That being said, if they start turning on Christians, the politics could make that go sideways, given the fairly Christian nationalist trend in US politics.
Is that not a terrorists house? Or is it in your eyes an innocent civilian?
If it's truly only civilians they have nothing to fear, since they won't be attacking the IDF.The fact that so many people think this will be a bloodbath already implies they believe there are thousands of terrorists there.
Wow... and they wonder why all the hate is raining down on them from all over the world...
You must have been born 5 minutes ago
Just be careful.  About a third of them are more than happy to down some catagon and show you how they plan to do it.
Shitty click bait title
Sorry, which command and conquer game specifically? I'd love to try it out.
Looks like a modern warfare game
It means "We'll throw the Jews from the river to the sea".It's a call for genocide. a person that has been thrown to the sea is a dead person
The bans are worth it
The Israelis are going Biblical. The Old Testament speaks of killing or driving off the enemy then salting the land so that nothing grows. &amp;#x200B;They're probably creating a very large no man's land and showing what their retribution looks like so that Hamas, Hesbollah and other Iranian proxies don't feel like doing that again.
‚ÄúHow dare you throw a beverage on me as I steal your home! How anti-Semitic of you!‚Äù
I remember this video. It‚Äôs at least a year old if not more. So disgusting.
The sea is the Mediterranean Sea, and the river is the river Jordan. It means they want all the land between the two to be a Palestinian State (which never actually existed, despite what the terrorist lovers would have you think). It also means that the current state of Israel should be utterly destroyed, and the jews who live there now killed, driven out, or at best allowed to live as second class citizens. Much of the arab world is, sadly, antisemitic to a degree that would make Heinrich Himmler go "hey, that's a bit much"
Halle-fucking-luyah
It‚Äôs Dominos‚Äô slogan for the area serviced by their new drone-delivery program, and they‚Äôre astroturfing pro-Palestinian groups to help make it go viral.
Straight up Nazi shit. Digusting.
100% agree.
While I want that bridge gone, it would be better if they ran away. If/when Ukraine retakes Crimea it will be a massive can of worms trying to get the Russians out.
Qatar.
I recently saw a video of even Palestinian citizens doing the same when Hamas attacked Isreal. Really baffling both sides think murdering other people for their own cause is a moment of celebration for them. ü§Æ
So the numbers would not appear. No need to give info to our lovers on the other side
It's a call for the extermination of jews. Let me stress that this is yet another call for the extermination of the jews by the Muslim states that are around them. I think this is like 3rd time where this has happened on such a large scale.
Ah ok gotcha. Every historical resource I‚Äôve ever looked at says that Jews have lived on that land since 1000BC, but clearly that was all a lie. Thank you for enlightening me! Damn those occupiers
Thought I was about to see some mashed potatoes
Maybe on Reddit.  But polling in the US show massive public support for increasing financial aid to Israel.  https://maristpoll.marist.edu/polls/the-war-between-israel-and-hamas/
A race to the bottom of humanity.
Rat dad of about a decade here.  Few observations, from their bulk, these are rats, age between 6 month and 18 months, so teens/young adults.  Looks like they just did a round of spray paint on the entire box, so unlucky ones are super disoriented from paint in their eyes.  They got moved from a plastic bin to a cardboard box, likely  dumped in a similar manner.  The quantity  and lack of movement when they got dumped suggests that these are pet store feeder rats (domestic rats raised to be food for reptiles etc) with calm demeaners and in consistant irriation from  crowding, paint and unknown status of food/water.Each one of those is a very social and unique little soul that trusts humans enough to be picked up and handled.   I burried 3 in the last 3 weeks after their brief but spoiled af lives, with 1 surviving sister who acts more like a free roam cat than a caged rat. And this, cruelty... A line has been crossed.I'm huff some ruskie copium thinking that these fellas got rounded up and sent to the humane society and find their forever homes.
Has a nice ring to it.
The moment she turned 18, she made an only fans‚Ä¶ made that in record time‚Ä¶. Very sad really
It's fucking insane that there are people who think that there was no one in Palestine prior to the 1940s.
&gt; plenty of folks are not deep thinkersTherein lies the source of much of the world's problems.
The person taking this video knew the strike was coming. Very interesting.
There are multiple bad guys in this story. Hamas and the IDF are the two biggest. Both are bad. Both are wrong. Both are killers. The victims are Jewish/israeli, Palestinian, and other minorities as well. I believe Hamas expected and wanted this overwrought and heavy handed response in an attempt to draw others into a larger war.
A lot of them definitely were born in America*
What else do you call cutting off food and water to a civilian population of mostly kids? Bombing of hospitals and refugee camps? It's clearly a genocide.[https://jewishcurrents.org/a-textbook-case-of-genocide](https://jewishcurrents.org/a-textbook-case-of-genocide)[https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/gaza-un-experts-decry-bombing-hospitals-and-schools-crimes-against-humanity](https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/gaza-un-experts-decry-bombing-hospitals-and-schools-crimes-against-humanity)
I see someone worked with IDF programs and coding in the past haha
&gt; Genuine question, what do you think Israel should‚Äôve done after 1400 people were slaughtered on their own turf? Sit back and accept it?If killing innocent civilians is wrong, then it's wrong.  You don't get to kill innocent people because some of your innocent people were killed.If you think Hamas was wrong for killing innocent people, then you should think Israel is wrong for doing the exact same thing.
That's fucked up. Every tankie i know parrot this i never realized...
I mean, I think plenty of folks are not deep thinkers and think it's just calling for Palestinians to be "free" wherever they live (thinking "from the river to the sea" describes where Palestinians live).  They're not thinking any deeper about states or implications or demographics, etc.It's dumb, but it is a catchy slogan.
And then wonder in a few years time why Muslims keep wanting to destroy Israel.  Over and over and over and over and over....
Yes it's a descriptive term that carries a huge amount of weight, yet you are using it incorrectly. Knowingly incorrectly, hence propaganda.
I can't believe the evil IDF destroyed a terrorist's house!!ü§¨üò°üò†‚ùåÔ∏è‚ùåÔ∏è
says translation iin the comments i dont see it
Why you believe Israel numbers but don‚Äôt believe Palestinian numbers?
They are. If you‚Äôre asking why does that not matter that is different. I‚Äôm guessing America would be the answer. If I recall, we had some collateral issues as well.
Because genocide is descriptive. They are killing thousands of civilians. They cut off food and water to these civilians. It's indiscriminate killing, reprisals for the attacks. They either leave Gaza in such a horrible state most Gazans leave as refugees or they cram them into the southern half of Gaza to create and even worse humanitarian crisis than before.
The woman apparently is the mother of one of the soldiers in the video being deployed
Thank you Kurt. I am not a dumbass, and whole heartedly believed that Israel would not, be willing to massacre an entire race because they went through it. The Jewish people have experienced a holocaust and therefore would not preform their own. Today, it‚Äôs just hard to see what the IDF is doing and ask ‚Äúhow is this not a holocaust‚Äù, ‚Äúhow is this ok‚Äù?The celebration of dead children, bombing civilian corridors. I‚Äôm no fool, and understand the threat hamas presents to Israel.Compounding the issue is Israel‚Äôs defensiveness to being called out! Israel‚Äôs representatives willingness to use words like ‚Äúextermination‚Äù, does not help their case!
That's not the point he is making. He is insinuating that all brown people do this, and they should go back to India to do this. Also, that still has nothing to do with anything. This is just assault, assault happens literally everywhere. Specifically saying "brown people that come to Canada just assault other people indiscriminately" is outrageously racist
No way, and when Hamas kills Israelis they dance and cheer too, it's almost like neither side cares for one another. Shocking!
No one accused them of being smart.
Then it's not genocide, so why use the term ? Throwing buzzwords about likely picked up from propaganda much ?
Many support this.  US and UK most prominentlyEdit: when I say that I meant the governments not the people
[Assyrians yes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assyrian_people)
LESS TALKING! MORE RAIDING!
if you had asked me 4 months ago if state/empire propaganda could function in 2023 at this level, with this much efficiency and breadth, I would have said it couldn't. It's wild.
Have a look around
Meh, even that one goes into full circlejerk mode quite often.
Oh wow you are stupid. That's not a straw man argument, but straw man argument is something stupid people misuse to sound smart.
Israel has always wanted Hamas to provoke them so the IDF can be sent into Gaza and put a full stop on the Palestinian issue once and for all. "From the River to the Sea" and all that.
My point
Realistically...did the Israeli defense and intelligence complex really slip up on a massive attack three weeks ago but all of a sudden is supposed to know all the locations and safe houses of all these high value targets?  It can only be either or...
Could this be flashes from bombardment of Avdiivka? Or they look to close?
All one has to do is to ask the people that do that chant, to draw a map of what they want the borders to be.Then sit back and watch them run away because they KNOW what they are chanting about.
Lol I never got banned from anywhere before, but three bans in the past two weeks.  It's getting insane over here, but tbf so am I.
They're the Germans, Italians, and Syrians... still holding their turf.
Might as well just state that Israel killed 2.5 million at this point. If you keep parroting inflated numbers Israel just might have to match them to keep those numbers true.
[https://ryanmcbeth.substack.com/p/did-israel-just-stop-a-hamas-truck] (Fits the narrative)
There are still thousands of accounts that have been around since 2018 when there was a possibility of the UK electing a pro-Palestinian Prime Minister in 2019  They are fairly easy to spot if you go through the users comment history as many of the posts are just rabid hate, and if you look at things like the timings of the posts - 9 to 5 GMT+2 and nothing ever posted on a Friday - you soon get the feeling of an organised  propaganda machine at work.
Someone from the Mi6 should do a Kennedy on Trump, if else the world, I mean the west is in for chaos. Biden is doing everything to piss off the young generation that have kept him afloat and who are pro Palestinians. If he thinks these type of rhetoric is going to go with them he is highly delusional. So hopefully, some european help him a bit as they don't want for the US to leave Nato and thus help Poutine friend Trump.
She was never riding high
Jfc.Literally asking for genocide in this ‚ÄúDo not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey‚Ä¶.‚Äù
Nazi cunts.
It is unironically to exterminate Israel and all the people who identify as israel citizens. Women, children, toddlers, men and boys, to wipe them out. To wipe the jewish culture out, destroy all jewish inspired landmarks and religious icons, to remove israel as a country and then exterminate israel born people wherever they are in the world.Its a cry for genocide and total extinction of a people.
As much as I love this place I hate it when people flat out lie to make a joke funny. Thank you!
exactly
The Mossad killed Iran's top nuclear scientist while he was in a convoy in Iran and left the guys wife sat next to him untouched.As far as I know it was the first use of autonomous A.I. to kill someone.All the billions Qatar wasted on the world cup, trying to improve their image. Only to throw it away by reminding people about it being a corrupt slave state and now Terrorist haven.Qatar is currently trying to mediate, they'll be lucky not to end up beside their HAMAS friends.
Do you have such a heartful stance on the  Uyghurs in China?I'm in no way saying this should be tolerated. But it's factual that time is the only difference between our ancestors that faced horrific atrocities.These groups or people have been at war for a long time and should be handled within thier country just like everyone did for China. Hypocritical really.
Was their goal to reduce the amount of "chicken" McNuggets that McDonalds serves?
Wasnt the original "From the River to the Sea, Palestine will be Arab"
Assholes.
https://x.com/alexhiggins732/status/1719071518187999687?s=46There is the video. Israel is committing war crimes and a cease fire is needed, but it doesn‚Äôt change the fact that Hamas did parade her body in the streets. Both things can be true.
Well, some sort of medical invention was made that we weren't meant to have...
It‚Äôs honestly a catchy tune.
I'm sure you will find similar "prophecies" in Mein Kamph to support your argument.
How the government perceived and talked about MLK in his lifetime and how they talk about him now are worlds apart.
I'm definitely not voting for Trump, though. He's the worst possible choice between him and Biden. Besides, we've already seen what's Trump has done to this country in 4 years. I can't even begin to imagine what he will do if he wins the presidency again...
Yeah. It doesn't help that those in power on both sides are convinced there are no civilians on the opposing sides. That being said, Israel is just a cash cow for American industry. Compare the death toll number on both sides, especially amongst children, and it's clear who the real evil side is
And what about the others, can you show me one religions where their was no barbarity. In France their is the massacre of the saint Barthelemy day with thousands of Protestant killed by catholic, more recently at least 200 000 Iraqis directly and more than 500 000 overhaul. I am sure if you search just a little bit you will see act of war motivated by religion by the hundreds. From, Muslim, Christians, Jews, Buddhist, etc etc.
What a brave man
Some of them probably were born in America but the "right of return" gives them the "right" to suddenly come to Israel and claim "citizenship". It's fucking ridiculous.
Look ma, a butthurt Indian trying to make Canadians look bad on the internet because they‚Äôre mad at Canada right now!
In some parts of northern Gaza the water table is 70 - 105 meters. You know, the area Israel wanted civilians to evacuate from‚Ä¶There‚Äôs also a large area in the south near egypt where the water table is 70 - 105 meters.On the shore and in the middle of Gaza it‚Äôs 25 - 35 meters.So yes they have deep tunnels in the south near Egypt and in the north closer to Israel.Deeper than 105 meters would also be possible, depends on the geology and the inflow rate. The water would be useful on the surface as well, think of the deepest point as a giant well. Bit of an issue with no power but if inflow is relatively small and they have a large series of deep sumps, it would take awhile for areas below the ground water table to flood in the absence of power to run pumps.But they don‚Äôt need their tunnels to be deeper than 70 - 105 meters. They‚Äôre going for relatively deep tunnels but on a large scale. Volume over depth.
It's always ironic when people of color take this stance because these are the same kind of demonstrations that forced the government to end segregation.
If you say then then you agree that America deserved 9/11.
not-so-safe house.
They are just as bad as Hamas
Oh yeah, cause the British Government is known for giving people back their land üíÄ

I saw this and immediately got cultist-chan from warhammer vibes and damn, nice
Vile
Im ready to start calling Biden "genocide joe" at this point. He is not leveraging for peace in any way, he is enabling genocide.
It okay to believe that both sides of a conflict are wrong and have blood on their hands.  You don't get to invalidate my feelings on it.  I believe there are plenty of people on both sides and observers who want both sides to stop the way they are carrying on.  It is not idealism.  It is a desire.  It is not idealistic to want peace.
To eradicate hamas up to it's last member, occupation of territory might continue for the duration of the war but i doubt it will actually become officially occupied
You can't just kill thousands of Jewish people for no reason other then you hate them and expect a reward.
But have you literally seen hockey bros doing this in the India? Because that kind of the point he‚Äôs making
Anyone like this is fucked in the head.
Don't forget Canada! We love this too.
Agreed, but I wonder what would happen if a man with an Israeli accent‚Äîmaybe even the accent of some European country‚Äîwalked around Sydney, better still Brisbane, maybe even Darwin, and ask similar questions to people he saw there, also saying "You ought to be ashamed of yourselves."
It is probably real, in rugby.
They bombed their own hospital and now they're in the last testament for control of Gaza. Putin would be proud.
Then what? The rest of the 2.2 million who've had their families and homes blown up can go back and clean up the rubble in peace? Like sure, Hamas is shit but if you think what Israel is currently doing is going to solve that you're eating up the propaganda. They're fueling the fire to prevent peace, to keep terrorists, to give them reasons to keep pushing into the land until nothing is left.
Kinda looks like an ammo depot cooking off but if its cluster ammo in an inhabited area that would be bad. Hope it isnt
That's called the straw man argument my man. And the fact that you have to resort to that proves my comment above
Genocide is cool if can control the narrative, bury evidence &amp; all your people agree it‚Äôs OK.   I don‚Äôt see how Israel is NOT gonna screw the pooch going all biblical on the Palestinians left in the country.   I do not wanna see US boots on the ground when ALL of Israel‚Äôs neighbors see lines being crossed.Us against the world applied to Germany in 1933,  most would think the founders of the Israeli government being on the the receiving end of where that leads - might not - choose the same path.  But here we are.BTW, I like being a US citizen - but ask any indigenous blooded American how they feel about the trail of tears.
I was just writing the other day about how stupid a misstep that comment was on Clinton‚Äôs part, especially considering how much experience she‚Äôd had in politics. She should have known that her caveat about not all Trump voters being included in the ‚Äúbasket‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt make a difference. She handed that shit to Trump on a silver platter. As much as I dislike Bill Clinton in terms of his policies, he‚Äôs proven himself to be extraordinarily skilled at campaigning, so I feel like his heart must have dropped the second he heard her say that lmao
Murderers. No matter what anyone says. To kill thousands of innocent kids and babies is disturbing. These fuckers are nothing but cowards and murderers. Stop killing innocent people or this will never end and it will get worse. How can they forgive and not forget that they took their land and murdered their kids? That‚Äôs if Israel doesn‚Äôt completely flatten Gaza like the American psychopath politicians are encouraging. The world is fucked and it‚Äôs our leaders and religions fault!!
That‚Äôs absolutely disgusting.
too much antisemitism on Reddit these days.  Hard to even understand the pro-Hamasshole position after Oct 7th.   Bye now
You forget the deaths per capita of his attack is an order of magnitude beyond 9/11.
The kindest, most gentlest take is that it means that there should be a Palestinian nation state the goes from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean, which means the complete erasure of the State of Israel.
Religious fanatics feigning ignorance of reality in order to benefit socially and financially?I'm shocked! Shocked, to find that racism is going on in here!/s

The Mediterranean is the sea. The river is the river Jordan. Between those is Israel and Palestine. Hamas promised to cleanse the area between the river and the sea of Jews. So the phrase ‚Äûfrom the river to the sea‚Äú is a dog whistle meaning ‚Äûkill all the Jews‚Äú/edit there are also people using the phrase not knowing what it means. If the social media side of this conflict has proven anything, it‚Äôs that people have really strong opinions about things they have no understanding of.
What the fuck is that on your helmet?A peace symbol, sir!Is that supposed to be some kind of sick joke?
Since when? ü§£
And this is why people are not backing Israel.  Honestly, I am not surprised at all that Hamas shot some rockets at them.  If some assholes were pushing my people out of their homes, stealing their shit and arresting their children for throwing rocks, I'd shoot a rocket at them fuckers too.
How are these not war crimes?
also all israelis on linkedin turned into propaganda bots, linkedin network gets flooded by pro-israeli hammasisisis hashtags
The most generous interpretation is they want a one state solution causing the demographics to shift meaning Israel is no longer a Jewish state.A less generous (and more realistic) interpretation means dead Jews, exiled Jews, or dhimmi status.That said, given the level of rhetoric there's many reasons to believe that even a generous interpretation means bad news bears for the Jews.

Yup, it's the hamas goal put in an innocent form so idiots will parrot it."From the river to the sea, jews will be put beneath"
I assume bots or people blinded by propaganda. I can't even speak to my Jewish friends about this war in any logical sense, they are too busy astro-turfing my Facebook feed with  pro-Israel propaganda.I spoke to my grandfather about his time in WW2 and he always mentioned how war is not black and white, and he feared his allies just as much as the Nazis. When he was freed from his prisoner of war camps, the allies that "rescued" them, also stole their food and raped the woman. These were people that were supposed to be supporting him in the war.What I learned from this, that in war, both sides can be absolutely inhuman and evil, and it doesn't really matter which side you are on.
Most of Gaza is urban warefare. Tanks do not excel in that type of environment.

Raqqa was the worst. After the battle in 2017, it left 80% of the entire city as uninhabitable. Almost every photo just shows gutted buildings and hardly any that look untouched. Anything standing over 15 feet tall has had its interior blasted out.
Dead, not removed.
Most of Hamas' leaders aren't in Gaza. That's why the Israelis are carrying out punitive strikes against the civilian population.It's collective punishment.
Cause they could see it they just ignored it, sends Israeli nationalism through the roof and helps secure their presidents job security
You can speak on what you want when you want as I don't give a shit. Do your research before you speak as it makes you look like an ass.2 sides to every story. If you don't know both sides shut your mouth and go back to your video games!

No idea why you are getting downvoted, your statement seems pretty rational to me at least.
I would love to be able to agree with this point, but looking at the numbers and videos man, 10k dead people in few weeks and today 400 in one strike, something is very wrong here

Don't stop until Hamas is no more.
Ah, nah man am staying to annoy you lol
This is the point I disagree with. Israel isn‚Äôt systematically targeting civilians, they are just operating in one of the most difficult areas in the world to avoid civilian casualties. People that think Israel is purposefully killing civilians refuse to think of the situation logically. What purpose would it serve for them? When they kill a civilian they are, A: bringing down international condemnation and losing the PR war and B: expending extremely expensive munitions on non-military targets. It simply does not help them to ‚Äútarget‚Äù non combatants. Again; civilian casualties are unfortunate but unavoidable. This is especially true when your area of operation is one of the most densely populated cities on the globe, terrorists are deeply embedded within the civilian populace, and you need to target tunnel networks built beneath civilian infrastructure. It‚Äôs extremely difficult in this environment to strike a balance between risking your own soldiers and causing collateral damage.
One way that helped me reframe the conflict in my own mind is not thinking about this through the prism of "Palestine vs Israel" or "Islam vs Judaism". It starts to feel like some sort of sports match when it is framed this way. A more humanistic lens would be to frame it around human rights vs. those who would deny human rights.It sounds like your side is pro-human rights. A lot of Israelis died on October 7th but it would be intellectually dishonest to look at October 7th in a vacuum. October 7th is over and lots of people died, now 10x times that number of innocent civilians in Gaza are dying at the hands of Israel, which is using U.S. funding and military hardware to attack civilians and civilian infrastructure. We must demand a ceasefire now. But the genocidal and fascist insanity I am seeing coming from "pro-Israel" voices makes me think brutal destruction of innocent lives is just getting started.

There are plenty of industrial areas in Donetsk, that russians used to store ammo and repair their equipments since 2014, all the while being less than 10 km from frontline. There is no suprise that they would be targeted. They were also one of the first targets hit after Ukraine received precision munition, like GMLRS and Excaliburs, but wasn't really targeted before, which definetly wasn't that hard to do with less precise weapons.

Hellfire Missile. As long as the weapon is selected the box for the seeker will be there
they will move naturally towards safety of south Gaza with time. North will be a battlefield with lack of water,  electricity,  supplies since aid mainly comes from Rafah crossing and will stay in the South.It is in the interest of IDF to help the last civilians to quit North Gaza in order to clean all hamas pockets and collapse/destroy all tunnels.
They seem to be embracing the blood lust of war. And crying foul when confronted.
Even Obama and Biden‚Äôs support. wtf. I‚Äôd understand if it was just the fucking vile GoP.
Thank you üòä

You will perish and everyone will see this, We won the social media
This made me nauseous. These people are evil
Nonsense. Hamas literally calls for the destruction of Israel in their charter. Try reading it.Besides, pre-1967 borders is not a solution. They had that once... before 1967... And their neighbors still tried to annihilate them in multiple wars. They have no incentive to agree to that again and their neighbors have never given Israel a reason to trust they'll abide by agreements.
LMAO Russia would destroy Kiev if they could, and are bombing kiev whenever they please... patriot systems are shooting down most of the ballistics entering kiev.
I don‚Äôt know how they expect this to get anyone on their side. It‚Äôs just animal cruelty
Lol,1. You are delusional if you think Israel is interested in the land of Gaza, they even offered it to Egypt a few times and Egypt refused. That land is just s shithole that nobody wants. If they will occupy it, it will be for security reasons only.2. Yes, Israel genocided the Palestinian Gazans from 1mil to 2mil in just a few years time.
There is no justification for killing people, terrorists
What? Canadians and Americans don‚Äôt fight?
Close air support, air assets directly supporting troops on the ground
Except the Philistines, Babylonians, Romans, Syrians, Byznatium, Egypt, and The ottomans.
Just pretend to be terrorist, receive millions of dollars, dig tunnels, buy rtx4090, play vidya game underground, profit???
Need to decolonize Australia next.
True, also systematic targeting civilians is an act of war crimes, humans needs to come together rather than spending too much time and effort to kill each others
i cannot WAIT till the hamas leaders in qatar start dropping like flies... LMAO
this is really truly comparable to Hitler army. they‚Äôve really been convinced that no Palestinians are humans.
Christian backing of Israel is just public relations. Israel exists because the US needs an imperial outpost there. Christians could all stop backing Israel tomorrow and the US would still be propping it up.
For me both sides are targeting civilians and thats wrong, one does it with Ak47s and the other does it with fighter jets, its sad to see how mad the world gone
Honestly I disagree. The propaganda machine is loud, it is powerful enough to drown out a lot of voices. But, as I pointed out in another reply to a comment here: the amount of voters this comparison is going alienate can not be understated. No one who was holding a tiki torch in Charlottesville was at one of these demonstrations holding a Palestinian flag.But I'd happily bet my annual income that most of the people there voted for Joe Biden in the last presidential election. And if I were them, if any number of his previous statements or policy moves regarding Israel over the past 3 weeks hadn't already made him unsupportable, this will have. The propaganda machine is getting desperate.
"Israel isn't known for doing things wrong"Yikes. Just yikes. It can't be an attempt at genocide or ethnic cleansing because *they're bad at it* and they are known for *being good at stuff*...That's certainly an opinion that a person can have I guess. Fuck me.
Republicans want to defund the government to send it to Israel‚Ä¶Fascists gotta stick together in these dark times.
it's not... It's god is great...
All the important people in Hamas aren't in Gaza. you're just creating more terrorists. Did you learn nothing from afghanistan and iraq
It doesn‚Äôt improve the world‚Äôs view of Israel
Wow and that's NOT a Sacha Baron Cohen sketch???Fuckin eh man what a disgusting part of the world, all because of magical sky people and some special religious dirt.
what an ignorant comment. I have literally seen groups of white ass hockey bros doing this exact same thing at bars so many times. Race has nothing to do with it.
Dude, this doesn't even look like Allepo
That‚Äôs where one of the fallacy is.  Hamas repeatedly states they are willing to stop violence if a fair compromise is reached (1967 borders).   Israel‚Äôs right to exist does not have to mean the destruction of the indigenous people there.
Religion is the cancer of this world. So many idiots believing in fairy tales &amp; thinking it can dictate how the world works.
They've become Nazis
I wrote HASBARA BOTS ASSEMBLE over there and got banned immediately lmao
That comment was spot on, it does suck hard to be Jewish right now. As someone who grew up in a very Jewish neighborhood, and then went to College in a place where there aren‚Äôt many Jews, my entire social media feed is filled with radically conflicting voices spouting insane propaganda from both sides. I have Jewish friends looking at me like I‚Äôm an animal for not vocally supporting Israel online, while I have other non Jewish friends who are waiting with bated breath to tell me why Zionism is destroying innocent lives. I just don‚Äôt want innocent people to suffer, idk why that stance requires me to pick a side
How do they know where/when to film?
Whataboutism
We the victims of genocide learned how to genocide so we genocide.
I wouldn‚Äôt say civilian deaths are justified, but they are an unavoidable consequence of war. No war is ever fought without civilian casualties.
The best form of this insult is "dork ass loser" for future reference.
Combat footage is just the Israeli propaganda page now
Israel and Jews have existed there for thousands of years. The UN partition is just one iteration of the state among many. Modern Israel has an extremely good military.Hamas doesn't think Israel has a right to exist and all the Jews should be killed. Hamas has a far weaker military than Israel but won't give up.What ensues from there is logical and inevitable.
Zionist are the fucking scum of the Earth. The US has immense blood on its hands for supporting thus.

Except themselves. public opinion lost afghanistan. it will lose you this war too. Congrats you can bomb defenseless people in an open air prison. Lucky Hezbollah isn't getting invovled.
Do you actually believe Israel bombed the hospital? The Israeli government was very clear that they were not responsible for bombing the Al ahila hospital and literally all evidence that has emerged points to a misfired rocket by PIJ.
*opens a history book*
What does CAS mean?
The propaganda machine is strong.
This is exactly what Hitler was saying about the Jews.. dangerous, vile, needed segregation. So he locked them up first, then forbid them from walking non Jewish streets, then threw them in the gas chambers...You can't make rules that exclude a whole population based on race or religion because of a few bad apples. And this is in Jerusalem btw, not Gaza.
There‚Äôs a big difference between those who worship Jesus as if he‚Äôs God and Ones who try to practice the principles taught to Us by our savior in all Our affairs

Game over.
Why are you getting upvoted for knowing where Brampton is
&gt;Gadot expressed strong criticism of the demand for humanitarian aid and a cease-fire with Hamas while 224 Israelis are being held captive in the Gaza Strip.&gt;I‚Äôm asking myself what happened to humanity? How could that be? Why do we need to convince people that that is not okay when others are asking for a cease-fire ‚Äì and I‚Äôm all for peace, don‚Äôt get me wrong ‚Äì but the hostages are still there, not a word about the hostages. What are you talking about?https://www.ynetnews.com/culture/article/s1agkbugt#autoplay
We can play this game all day.  Israel is literally stolen land.  1948 UN partition that was called unfair.  That‚Äôs why Palestinians are fighting.  The solution to this will never be military unless you 1. Massacre the entire city like the mongols 2. Remove the entire population by force. Both of which are disgustingly immoral.
&gt;IDF Spox: We're doing everything we can to minimize civilian deaths.If I had my head up my ass and was blind with both eyes and deaf with both ears I still wouldn't believe this.They're actually mocking the people when they say this, it's like being sarcastic.
Well found, thank you.
this is a MIC simp sub remember? nobody here has morals.
"Basket of deplorables" moment. In that the number of voters this single statement will (and frankly should) irreconcilably alienate can not be understated.
It's not about being palestines not being able to take [bus.](https://bus.It) It is safety of the bus passengers as there can be hamas masked as palestinian who takes hostage instead of travelling that scares people.
Hamas, being forced to quickly garner public support, is beginning to adopt unconventional propaganda tactics‚Ä¶
Yes, and some of us hate and despise our own people for being ignorant to it.
No longer safe.
I got banned from world news for saying ‚ÄúIsrael is guilty of the same atrocities‚Äù It‚Äôs funny how people will swear that Israel are the good guys, unfortunately it ain‚Äôt a marvel movie and they‚Äôre no ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù all these governments have their agendaAll their people fed that agenda will eat it up
You know when good people do good deeds so they become better persons (religious or not) like helping the poor, respecting their parents, being good to the neighbors, saving lives, being honest and so on, it makes them get closer to their religion or simply makes them feel better as a person but when it comes to these Nazies murdering people is the good deeds for them, they literally think mass murdering humans makes them better, their own book says it here:[https://pastebin.com/DhAAibLs](https://pastebin.com/DhAAibLs)
Terrible people terrible song, pretty good singing voice though üé§
Hamas just killed 1400 Israelis and kidnapped 200, so they obviously can fight back. Just not symmetrically.
Hamas, as a military organization, would indeed make every area they attack as an open warzone. However, an unprompted attack on foreign soil by any party can qualify as a terror attack, especially if the primary target is civilians. At minimum, during the initial October 7th invasion, their primary target was civilians.If your argument is that Hamas‚Äôs  actions arent to be considered terror, you‚Äôre downplaying the point of the attack. Those 500 music festival participants certainly werent warned were they? They didnt receive a phone message stating gtfo. They didnt receive protection and immunity from the conflict did they? No, they were targeted. Theres a difference between terror and an organized military attack. Now militaries do use terror as a tactic. And whenever they do, they should indeed be vilified, regardless of their purpose. Dont defend either side. But one is certainly not as nice as the other
They were in last time, did they took area? This fucking media made them go back, that was the oportunity to eliminate hamas forever and put some palestinian authority with no radical thinking in power. The problem is to live near terrorist bombing you everyday and everytime you respond you are labeled as terrorist. Israel defend themselfes for years.
Over time it surprises me just how well the Command and Conquer Generals developers replicated the Hamas style of warfare with their terrorist faction. I remember tunnels and motorcycles and rocket buggies.
F1 + F3 never fails
P.S: I'm not a Muslim because I was born a Muslim, but rather mostly because how the world's history &amp; events are shaped to be progressing towards a pre-specified future and since Islam is not only a religion limited to beliefs &amp; practices in personal lives but its a system as well, something a religion should provide in order to solve as many human or societal problems as possible (I'm not saying all problems) and guide ways from problems arising in the first place.Something both Christianity and Judaism lack. Not interested in Polytheist religions like Hinduism as they are mostly based on fictional characters and promote many unhygienic practices.
Israel kills thousands of civilians then puts on a Star of David, "Look what the evil UN is making us do! I'm not saying you're all Nazis, but really only Nazis wouldn't let us kill Palestinians."
Israel won't be stopped unlike the Russians.
Ukrainian Himars operator probably looks at all the bunched-up tanks and is losing his shit.
Israel is adding cope cages to the tops of tanks to counter that
Always check the comments.  You posted your question about an hour after /u/noptuno posted a direct link.https://open.spotify.com/episode/6B7yov0hQKhoJogiFEaN3w?si=hkv5JRHdRnenqrNgmBiuHw

Good stuff. Operation Find Out is in full effect.
yeeeeeeeeah god really loves people who kill 10000+ civilians.
As a Canadian who only knows like one or two Jewish people, I have no reason to dislike Jews. My grand parents fought to free them during the war and were prisoners of war as well when they got captured. It's disappointing to see the sacrifices made by many of our ancestors, abused in this way. My relatives didn't spend years in prisoner of war camps and death marches just for the people they saved to go act like monsters to another group of minorities.
i am sorry but my age cant deny this[https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/178e0tx/list\_of\_war\_crimes\_by\_israel\_complied\_by\_yanis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/comments/178e0tx/list_of_war_crimes_by_israel_complied_by_yanis/)
Yeah, mandatory 2 years of service in a competent army does make a huge difference though.
Zionists are worse than Nazis to me. They are a people who know firsthand the pain of oppression and being hunted to extermination and even warn the world constantly to never repeat the evils of fascism, and then happily cause that pain to an even more vulnerable group of people they deem lesser.Knowing that pain and then willingly inflicting it because you have the power to, makes you not only evil, but worse.What? Your way of life is under threat and you are defending your existence? The fucking Third Reich said the same fucking thing before they started murdering people too. All fascists deserve the worst fate.
Killing babies in their cribs was necessary? You disgusting plonker
So some additional context for this is that this was an amended resolution. The vote on the unamended resolution 5 minutes earlier saw most of those in opposition or abstaining voting in favor. The only change (that I know of) was the removal of condemning Hamas for taking hostages and demanding their safe release.

yea so what? a 16 year old cant speak politically?  whats your point mate the internet is a free place i get my information from everywhere isreal does warcrimes its known now you cant deny thatdoesnt matter the age speaking about it
Tell uae to bring its jihad,  watch the yanks pull their protection against iraq and Iran, let em take each other out
I would wait for more info before making conclusions based on this video.Cluster munitions are an extremely sensitive matter for the West. It is a nightmare if those shells are used anywhere around civilians. A political clusterfuck for those that approved that transfer.At the same time, they are extremely needed by Ukraine. They are very effective against Russian infantry in fields and lightly armored / unarmored vehicles. They are so much loved by the Ukrainian artillerists.In the shortage of production of common 155mm shells, the US has millions of the cluster ones (scheduled for scrapping anyways). Ukraine craves them, a sizeable amount of them will be (and is) a gamechanger.Also, the ATACAMS provided to Ukraine are also cluster and they are super effective against airfields, because the bomblets easily destroy / damage the delicate aircraft and cover big area. The \~6 rockets are reported to have destroyed / damaged 26 aircraft in the first attack (mostly helicopters). Russians had to move two closest airfields out of the rockets reachNow, it doesn't require much thinking to understand that Russians will do what's possible to end supplies of the cluster munitions of any kind. They're too damaging to the Russian troops. So far there has been zero evidence that cluster munitions were used by Ukraine anywhere around civilians; this can be an attempt by Russians to discredit and end the suppliesLets wait for more info.
Before this is over I hope they blow the kirtch bridge, trapping all those who wanted to live the good life in Crimea. Enjoy!
A consequence of war propaganda. You can't fight an enemy if you give them moral value. These people really suck. The leaders who inspire this suck even more.

US-sanctioned genocide.Call it what it is; Genocide with the full support of the US government.
Moving day MF!

Funny how propaganda only works one way and never both ways with you people. The shit you post is true the shit the other side posts is false ... Sure thing you terrorist apologist....
aka: the 'find out' phase.
Israel doesn't have a specific timeline to meet these conditions, in general they don't care as long as they are willing to accept occasional attacks like this against them. They have absolute power and authority in the region. They can only win.They have no longer term plan for peace so this is the only path forward.
Is he sending you a Christmas card this year?
Turn public opinion? People have been overtly anti-Israel for decades, including in the immediate aftermath of the attack.Really all this shows is that people are the same everywhere. They think they are the good guys, want to have a boogeyman, and will easily spew hate. Arabs cheer killing of Jews. Jews of Arabs. US did the same after 9/11. Russia of Ukraine. Ukraine of Russia.You're not going to find a population who is free from assholes.
All of which applies in a war against a peer enemy with a real modern and dangerous military. Not against Hamas.
&gt;Does anyone know whether the Australia-New Zealand conflict is real or not?I see the Emutopian psy-op is going well

Most of those protestors gave you your job. Calling the progressives whose votes put Biden in office Neo-Nazis is certainly an interesting move.
And that was just yesterday!
You suck and are dumb.:)
Some are just plain hateful and brainwashed against Palestinians/Muslims but others are genuinely displaying the cognitive dissonance that our governments supporting this shit creates in us in real time.Jumping through *every* hoop to try and shift the blame and act like we aren't the bad guys to the civilians being terrorized by bombs raining from the sky.
the people on /worldnews would.
How do they even know who is in what buildings? Yet couldn't see an attack coming with hundreds of terrorists?Being down voted out of bias. Yet no real explanation.
Oh you mean like when they gave back the entire, oil-rich Sinai peninsula to Egypt after conquering it in the 73 war? Or when they pulled out of Gaza completely in 2005, ripping out Jewish communities only to get rocket fire in exchange? One fifth of Israel proper is Arab so they are truly incompetent at genocide.
Np, I ask in jest. I know there‚Äôs a difference between our noncredibility and outright untrue statements.
It 100% is going to cost him votes. It‚Äôs just a matter of how many. At the very least, many leftists who bit the bullet in 2020 by voting for him are going to stay home next year, as will a lot of Arab American voters. For me the real questions is the effect it‚Äôll have on rank-and-file liberals in general, who seem to be increasingly split on Palestine. It‚Äôs no longer just the leftists who are willing to recognize  and condemn Israel‚Äôs human rights abuses.
Act clueless when people die of lack of supplies while standing next to literal millions of dollars of supplies earmarked for those whose only goal in life is to kill Jews.
But you only have to memorize two words.
No respect. No fairplay.

You lose all credibility by calling a side "The people who want their kids to grow up safe" What are you 12?
I was going to say this is in the south east corner of Donetsk this is likely an ammo dump.
Not on this scale. Hell, you have Israeli military and government reps telling the world they are seeking annihilation of people just as was done to them. There are no cooler heads this time. Israel's biggest supporter, the US is literally giving them the green light and Israel has absolutely no interest in what the UN says if it says slow your roll. It is not the leadership of either that will prevail it must be average citizens from around the world who say stop and back the f..k up. Wrong is just wrong there is no other way to portray what is happening and who is pushing it and for what reasons.
I don't think anyone cares about coke in the White House or Hunter Biden. Buy regardless of what everyone here thinks about lesser-evilism and harm reduction voting, which I am somewhat sympathetic to, the reality of this next election is that it's going to be hard to turn out enough of the vote among young people, muslims and progressives if they think that the current administration is backing a genocide.  Doesn't matter whether or not it's the pragmatic thing to do, democrats are fucked if they continue on course.

They literally post up lawn chairs to see their airforce bombing gaza for entertainment.
&gt; If I'm gonna get my balls blown off for a word, my word is "poontang".
&gt;it‚Äôs a shame that Zionism has been conflated with JudaismThis was the whole point. They wanted Zionism and Judaism to be effectively interchangable because it allows for the argument, "If you're against what the Zionists are doing, then you're against Judaism/Jewish people in general."It's considered Anti-Semitism to compare Jews to Nazi's, despite what their actions are, and how they've effectively taken every page out of the Nazi's playbook. I don't harbour any ill-will to anyone of any nationality or religion, but I absolutely despise how Judaism has morphed into Zionism.
2~3 years of COVID, the first conventional near-peer war in Europe in decades, which also has thrown the world economy into a clusterfuck due to influence of oil/gas/sanctions, and now a conflict that can easily spiral out of control with one wrong move at one inopportune moment. And in a region which also controls the world's oil supply.
I saw that video, tunnels aren't that deep. Look fuck terrorism, but this doesn't look like any war footage of the last 10 years.  I was expecting ya know a little CQC and hamas resistant but I guess when you level a whole city not much left to fight for.
I‚Äôm saying this Israel Hamas shit barely belongs in combat footage.  It‚Äôs just state sanctioned bombing against people that can‚Äôt fight back lol
Tanks look really fragile after nearly a century of designing weapons to specifically kill tanks...But they really are damn near invincible against light infantry/insurgents. At best they might be able to knock the tracks off with an IED...but seems unlikely. Hamas be fukt.
It‚Äôs quite annoying to realise that Hamas are better at making underground passages than the water companies here in the U.K.

&gt;At that time I disagreed with the comment.Genuine question, why did you disagree with the comment at that time? Typically Israel/IDF isn't brought up unless it's related to a video of (generally) the IDF doing some completely inhumane shit, and those videos frequent this subreddit. If you were reading the comment under a post in reference to a video of the IDF doing something objectively terrible, as they are wont to do, why would you disagree?

Israelis have been playing victim so well, for so long  that they should get an Oscar. Many of my friends are Jewish, and every one of them have no use for Zionism or illegal settlements.
When they‚Äôve literally been dancing (and building amusement parks) on Palestinian graves for decades. It‚Äôs really interesting how people assume kindness and mercy from a government that is launching missiles and cutting off basic supplies to an area comprising mostly of children. Whatever fits their light skin saviour narrative though I guess.
Fuckin darksiders man.
But, when are these condition will be met exactly? There‚Äôs an obvious Muslim majority in the region and an obvious drastic increase in Palestinian population, even IF there are ‚Äúhorrific conditions‚Äù, they‚Äôre not working, and Israel isn‚Äôt know for doing things wrong.Try again.
People here argue about how many people died by they can't condemn that bombing a civil area is unjust. With this destruction, you can estimate that many people must have dies.
The hamas fighters that stormed into Israel proper on Oct. 7th were children when Israel bombed Gaza, they way it is doing now, in 2014. Teenagers when it did the same in 2018. All they've known is the constant dread of not simply their potentially imminent death but of everyone (anyone, any time) they love. All they've known is poisoned water, caloric deficit by design, drones designed to be as loud as possible always overhead. Snipers 300 meters away from the border fences with not only a license but an informal quota to kill and cripple.If we don't stop apartheid Israel, they won't stop themselves. Just like apartheid South Africa had to be stopped. Until we stop apartheid Israel, the Palestinian people will continue to try to because all they can see no one else is going to, and it is the right thing to do
How do you reached to the conclusion that Gaza people are lying?
Yup, that's what I ask the IOF/IDF propaganda commenters. "What are you going to do when you lose support from the US citizens and they force change at the polls?" We've seen how quickly $14.2 billion goes by. No country in their region likes them. No one. They lose US support they lose it all from my perspective.

How in the hell did that happen?
Gaza health ministry numbers. It‚Äôs like quoting russian sources only worse. Remember the hospital and 500 dead debacle.
The point isn't to kill them all, that's impossible to do now especially with US support. They just need to make conditions so horrific that they all eventually leave. Jews went from 5% of the population a hundred years ago. They are slowly getting there.
Aww, the poor thing needs her sleep ü•¥
I mean, tell them to leave Gaza, let the UN handle it. Act clueless when people die of lack of supplies.
Yeah because Hamas didnt publish this video
Now I just want to eat some McDonald‚Äôs
I feel like there's a couple differences between a country that doesn't see itself as one (Afghanistan) with a weak gob with little outreach and 3 industrialized nation states built on the European model.
The irony of this whole thing is the fact that these people went through the same thing almost 80 years ago and what was supposed to be a ‚ÄúNever again to anyone‚Äù became an excuse to commit genocide and ethnic cleansing towards the Palestinian people.In no way I condone what Hamas did, fuck them. However, you have to understand what drove these people to madness to do such thing. Israel ain‚Äôt a saint and never will be. So much for ‚Äúthe chosen people‚Äù.

This was not bombed by an aircraft but rather planted with explosives.
When Joe Biden tells you he's a zionist, believe him. Nothing he's saying (including the documented lies), either directly or through his cabinet and representatives, are out of step with zionist rhetoric and policy or values.
Or killing people indiscriminately in general.
Egypt and Jordan will behave themselves because they‚Äôre not degenerates and the US carriers are meant for Hezbollah and Iran Proxies.
No one should be surprised there are assholes on both sides of every conflict.
Yes because Hamas is such a trustworthy news source. Idiots in the comments be believing this shit without even caring. They want to believe something so they don‚Äôt care what‚Äôs true or false as long as it fits the narrative.
a lot of talk of eisenhower's D
"Mitznefet."  They breakup the soldier's silhouette and apparently help shield against the sun as well.  Commonly used by the IDF.
And the backing of all US politicians üòï
Uncivilized people.
&gt;  Carbon MonoxideCant use gas because geneva conventions prohibit this. But flooding the tunnels is fine, as well as using air burst munitions that burn and suffocate. International war rules are weird and nobody really follows them though.
GRADs
Israel is the main reason HAMAS got a foothold in Gaza.
it still exists, but they are monetizing the everloving fuck out of it
In a sentence: Because Israel is useful to the US, and Palestine is not.
Every post I see is israel being evil af.
I think they were bought by Ukraine as products, rather than some sort of donation.Anyone can make them, they just happened to get the ones made by the factory that does it in Israel.
This is going to be rough. Palestinian civilians used as innocent pawns and human shields against a superior military force. No Arab nations or allies willing to accept refugees... Shitty situation we're all just going to watch go down I guess.
In times like these, I ask myself "what would Jesus do?" ü§£ no pun intended my jewish homies
Both are shit. I support neither. Both sides have done awful things and I don't condone any of it.
This dude seems like just as big of an asshole as the people he‚Äôs demonizing. What a d-bag.
Sure will be interesting to see. Right now it seems like they‚Äôre just going for body count
This is Halloween, this is Halloween  Pumpkins scream in the dead of night  This is Halloween, everybody make a scene  Trick or treat 'til the neighbors gonna die of fright  It's our town, everybody scream  In this town of Halloween
Hamas uses the same playbook every time, they attack Israel then when Israel hits back. Bring out the dead civilians and kids to stop Israel from attacking them
And it's a whole lot better than "Allahu Akbar!  Allahu Akbar!  Allahu Akbar!".
Lmao you‚Äôve got to be kidding. Hamas will have a lot of snipers and probably a decent amount of good ones. Snipers will be a threat the IDF are worried about. Urban warfare is a sniper‚Äôs paradise. In a border zone like that there‚Äôs not much to do except take potshots.
My money is on Israel tacking full control and all the destruction is not only to destroy Hamas but to allow them to rebuild the city in there image.
Current modern US Army doctrine though calls for dispersed tactical assembly areas. As soon as a battalion hits the ground, it shoots its companies off and any further support or coordination at the battalion level on the RSOI phase now has to happen over comms. Even within the TAAs themselves, you're supposed to shoot out your platoons to create a "reconnaissance buffer zone" so the enemy can't locate your TAA. At least this is the strategy they've shifted to at CTC rotations. No more RUBA, no more FOBs. The idea is that if you got off a boat in Germany, Taiwan, or South Korea during a war, you would have to immediately fan out and find cover so that you don't get hit by artillery or air strikes.

What do you think Hamas were expecting to happen, if not this?
They are making it hard for me to empathize with them. They are making me nauseous like hamas has made me.
Fucking douchebag. Everyone has condemned Hamas. And today, I see a picture an Israeli bomb that disseminated a refugee camp. How many civilians, babies and children, does Israel get to kill before we are compelled to condemn Israel? I just want them to specify the number so we can "hold them accountable" for excessive murder. Is it 8k? 80k? Half a million? What's the quota, Israel? How many do you get to kill by cutting off food and water before it's gross?I just need a number.I'm Jewish, but I'm definitely NOT Israeli. Don't fucking use my religion as moral shield. That's joke has long played out. Fuck Hamas and fuck Israel's government. They're both terrorizing their citizens.
".... Strike the enemy. The end."

Yes I agree, Hamas are terrorists
On the Seventh Day of Tenth Month, on the Day of the Slaughter of the Lambs, there came upon the Land of Israel a horrible sight. And the Iron Hand of Israel reached back, and left nothing but embers and blight.
RPGs use a jet of molten metal to penetrate armor but when it hits the cage it loses some of that effect, meaning the main warhead will detonate outside the armor rather than inside.
It's essentially the Middle Eastern version of, "oh my god". If I'm not mistaken.
&gt; Hamas is hiding behind civilians, Israel is shooting despite that at targets but minimizing/justifying civilian casualties as they can.And, to be fair to them, a lot of the Israeli soldiers are _not_ going to be that careful because of the horrors that they see themselves as avenging. This isn't just another "they've got uppity we should suppress them"; this invasion is retribution and it's inevitable that that's how a good deal of Israeli soldiers will see it.I fear there's going to be a lot of footage of Israeli soldiers doing rather unpleasant things, of the sort we don't normally see from these sorts of incursions.
Israel been fucken around for 80 years now, i wonder to what extent the find around phase, especially with all those crazy arab nations around

Yeah, like Germany, Japan, Italy...
What a disgrace!!  You people are not part of humanity!  Period.

Right, then any Hamas attack is a warzone attack, Hamas also warned civilians to leave Tel Aviv, so its the same right? Right?
Before DS9 moved literally everyone to the Alpha Quadrant, the Beta Quadrant was where the majority of the Klingon and Romulan empires were.
Welcome to your 'Find Out' after the fuck around.
You‚Äôre stupid.
Yes, and there are Palestinian people alive today who are older than the apartheid state of Israel. They don't just remember Palestine. They recognise it. And their children and their children's children have been passed down the keys to the houses they were violent driven from, as heirlooms. Each generation has and will take ownership of those keys with an oath that one day they will return to the home of their ancestors for as long as it takes. The clock has far from run out on Palestinian liberation.
Does any of the above reasons (which is valid) justify so many civilians to loose their lives? Who has the right to judge? Who is good ? And who is bad ?
I need a list of subs where I can comment what I think, and subs where I risk a ban for not supporting Zionists
This rule isn't going to apply to 99.9% of our users. We'd already been enforcing this based on a different rule, this is just making it a stand-alone.
I hear you, then why we blame terrorists organizations then ?
Should we call for changes in the government of the 23 countries that are Islamic by constitution? I don‚Äôt agree that that would be a great idea, but it seems consistent with your previous statements.

Go Israel!
This is fucked. I get a warning because you say beheaded. What is wrong with the mods. I just posted what Israel is doing and have done. And NO one have beheaded any children you sick fuck. Stop watching FOX "news" Read what i have linked ffs.
unfortunately only catholics can dispel ghosts
hey so far it seems you have been blocking/restricting alot of the posts about the israel war, i am wondering it's more of a complete ban or a heavy restriction? or what sorts? lots of posts with hundreds or thousands of upvotes and locked very fast
Fallujah is an acception due to the sticking to the 3:1 ratio when it comes to assaulting/sieging major Urban environments(Well, for the second battle they did). Plus, the Insurgents in Fallujah didn't have access to conventional artillery, air or heavy armor, which is another factor. Just ambushes, IED's and barricading everything known to man in the city.  While there was 107 KIA on the coalition side, there was 613 WIA, for a total of 720/13,350 troops being a casualty in the battle, or a 5.4% casualty rate during the second Battle. While having 3:1 odds, better equipment and a multitude of support capabilities. It wasn't a cake walk.
It doesn‚Äôt even matter which side you are on, if you actively celebrate the death of innocents even if they are supposed to be your ennemies you are evil

They are literally playing Putin politics. It's insane and mind boggling anyone is falling for this crap. I'm so happy Trump was president because everyone got a fast track of media literacy shoved down their throats.
Fucking disgusting. Can't even honor the dead without being beaten and brutalized.
They are terrorists.
Can confirm
land stealers or not. It is not okay to go and kill innocent people. Israel is returning the favor.
Lol, so you just explained Israel in a nut shell. The only difference is Zionists were in bed with many nations in Europe (in particular Britain) and used those nations to take over Palestine. Please read up on the history in that region from 1917 to 1948 and get back to me. &gt;. In a historical context this would typically mean the absorption of the weaker society by the stronger society.Also in your own words, I do believe the og Jewish people were defeated around 700BC and exiled from that land.
Yeah really and how does one get that stuff into gaza
The ‚Äúcope‚Äù part of ‚Äúcope cage‚Äù means that the commenter is coping with the fact that they cannot form an objective opinion or comprehend that it actually *is* effective against drone dropped grenades, and partially effective against shaped charges that lose their power when they are triggered at a distance. It will not stop a Javelin or ATGM, fucking duh.Look at Bradleys in Iraq or even German Pz.IV. In WW2, they had additional side barrier/plate/fencing some distance from the main armor for exactly the same reason. INB4 I get marked a tankie because Russians might‚Äôve attempted one method that somewhat worked in certain scenarios üòÑ
Those fuckers are doing protests for Hamas. They should be glad they aren't immediately considered hostile terrorists

Holy shit do you even know how stupid your argument is
[just Google it](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=how+to+google)
So then what is the point?
Don‚Äôt forget to thank the US taxpayers for paying for them
There is also a history of Hamas carrying out heinous terroristic attacks.The leadership on both sides needs to be flushed and prosecuted so cooler heads can come to the table and negotiate peace.
So is Hamas still a terrorist organization?
Serious question... Why is it all these people seem to be able to say is 'Allah akbar'?
how come nobody wears cool costumes during streetfights? I recently picked up street fighter six and they have it all figured out.
But it‚Äôs funny
Bingo
Or you can not drop a bomb on them, that would work too. What a dumbass question, they don‚Äôt have food or water. You think they are worried about helmets? Think dude.
Completely possible too lol

I think the tractor kill was less lying and more just the incredible incompetence of the Russian Army. They probably really thought they hit a Leopard.

It's amazing how they ALWAYS get away with **hate crimes** in the eyes of Western countries. Whereas if people show too much support to Palestinians they get harassed and labeled by an ISM,with a constant looming threat to lose access to their social platforms let alone their job, internship, or scholarship.I wonder, did anything happen to those (apparently) NY jews who proudly and excitedly said that Israel will eradicate Palestinians and turn Gaza into a parking lot ? Were they identified ? Faced any repercussions ?
Exactly. And they know it too. They just don't care because antisemitism reinforces the Zionist project. The first wave of antisemitism was based on anachronistic Christian doctrine about Jews killing Jesus and demonizing Jewish religious practices. The second wave was about "race science". Stupid Nazi garbage. The third wave, if it can even be called that, is animosity toward Jews caused by the actions and propaganda of the Israeli state, which butchers children then claims they represent all Jews. This animosity bolsters the Zionist argument that Israel needs to exist to protect Jews from antisemitism. It's a sick, self-fulfilling prophecy.
It's funny when any country in the middle east says the same about Israel and Jews, they are anti Semitic. Jews don't practice apartheid. This system has one group discriminating against another. Israel actually wants something else. They want to cleanse the country of non Jews. This includes Christians, Muslims and Palestinians.
Chilling
Ctrl-A -&gt; Left Click.Shit fuck gawddamnitalltohell fucking ballista not you you morons
The difference is russia is just more untrustworthy. Like how one of the videos of a "leopard kill" was actually a tractor. Even if you are against the idf, they aren't as bad as russia when it comes to straight up lying
Yeah, fuck Israel.
Yeah, that‚Äôs why I don‚Äôt have these conversations in real life, or even online. It‚Äôs too much aggro and it‚Äôs a fucking stupid idea right now.
So they are like the Russians and their government: Complicit.
Lets see the video showing Hamas dragging a naked body in the street. Link it. You and your western devil worshiping pagan governments are the terrorists, terrorism is your specialty as shown by your bloody history. Oh and BTW just yesterday there was a video of the terrorist Nazi Israelis dragging a dead Palestinian with a rope by car.
Not at all. Lehi was a militant group during the founding of Israel and they made a deal with the German Nazis. Later Israel condemned them as terrorists, but after that one of the Lehi Leaders became prime minister ( Yitzhak Shamir). Israel is a product of white supremacy.

Yes
The Merkava is such a sexy tank.
Meanwhile hamas terrorists paraded the dead Shani Louk naked throughout gaza
Yeah nah youre braindead bro, √† 2 second search wouldnt given you the sauce. Youre too entrenched in your own ideology to even question yourself... you wont grow much if you never ask yourself questions
They don't care?
I'm not for either, but trying to understand, why hasn't the Palestinian people pushed out hamas to avoid this "hiding behind Palestinians" narrative?
For anyone saying this isn‚Äôt about religion needs to understand this.. this is the only reason Christians back Israel
Because the same people were shitting on Ka-52 footage, and now the Apache has released the same bad degraded quality but from even closer range.
Can we rename NATO the Global Defense Initiative?
India....allegedly.
Wherever they came from?  We know exactly where they came from..
Go ahead, make more people hate you Israel for terrorizing and murdering Palestine.You rejoice in slaughter, that's who you are and the world is seeing you for who you are.
Where the fuck do you live??? They're doing what people around the world are doing with the Israel Palestine conflict and projecting it onto their local area.  In too many cases, people are making this about jews not Israelis and Muslims not Palestinians. I'm sorry wherever you live is in support of the US becoming a place where that is remotely accepted but it is NOT.  It was a murder, and in multiple was some of the most disgusting even of murders.  We do not have any significant amount of people who believe this man should not be removed from society forever. Their understanding of the situation here is not correct and this is a single lunatic being an absolute piece of shit who committed inexcusable crimes.
You did have some settlers claim that they were shot and bombed by the IDF. Israel countered that Hamas had IDF uniforms.
Hence the concrete retention collars lining tunnels seen in most footage. Sand is unstable and prone to collapse, which is why underground mines usually aren't economically viable in such conditions.
A while back I saw a comment saying how heartbreaking it was to see those who survived the holocaust become as heartless as those who perpetrated them harm. At that time I disagreed with the comment. Now, I don‚Äôt know what to think ‚Ä¶

Never mind we've been independent for 200 years now.Like I usually say to my friends. We all know there is a lot of wrong stuff going on, but if you ever dare say that maybe we are part of the problem and should work on our own mentality, God forbid!

I mean this makes as much sense as attacking a music concert meant to bring attention to the plight of the people of Palestine with paragliders.
I somewhat seriously believe that half the reason we still have our nuclear deterrent isn't to deter other nations, it's to deter visiting alien races from fucking around with us. With as bright as nuclear detonations are, I've always wondered what one would look like through a telescope from 20 light years away.

Yeah, all the armchair experts suddenly decided they know more tanks than Israeli armor command - cause you know, they played world of tanks and arma‚Ä¶
I won't disagree. However, I have not done so indiscriminately. There is a history of Israel doing this. Recall the Suez Canal Crisis that Israel used along with France and Great Britain as a way to regain control not just of the Canal but as a way for Israel to gain control of Gaza and control of the region. Fool me once..but here they are at it again. Using anything they can to get that land and to create a final solution. They are doing to others what was done to them.
You‚Äôre welcome
There's a few speculations/theories of their plans to avoid that e.g. fill the tunnels with sewage, concrete even build a channel to the coast to flood them. Also if they destroy the generators then the air pumps will stop working. I guess we'll see.
Bro as an American who had 3000 fellow citizens die from Terrorism, Biden literally told Israel in a public statement to not commit the same mistakes we did after 9/11. For the most part the bombings haven‚Äôt been 10/10 chaos but like 7/10 which is much better than us in Baghdad. I doubt the Palestinians alive will ever want peace with an Israeli person for the rest of their lives.
Bro, you are on the internet
&gt;and empty of populationhow are they gonna do that?
Well yea, but then you have to introduce that wrinkle of the Palestinians think they don‚Äôt have a right to exist, so there‚Äôs no scenario where Jews can safely continue living there in two states and a sizable portion of Gaza support Hamas. So no, it‚Äôs not as simple as you claim. Your position implies that if Israel just said hey guys let‚Äôs just split it up and we‚Äôll live here and you do as well, that whole let‚Äôs exterminate the Jews ideology isn‚Äôt going to magically go proof.
&gt; IDF for sure has the ability to control the cityDo they? Because in 2004, the United States was forced to withdraw from Fallujah, a much smaller city controlled by a less entrenched force, after just six days of fighting, during a time where military technology was less favorable to the defenders. Occupying and holding Gaza is not a task that Israel could take on likely, which is exactly why they're negotiating with the United States, the Palestinian Authority and others to come up with a different plan. Look, this isn't an anti-IDF thing, these are the exact considerations IDF planners are currently taking into account. Since 2006, Israel's urban warfare strategy has improved a lot, and I don't think there are many forces more prepared for such a scenario, but a) this will be the first time they put those strategies to real test and b) I think you're underestimating how nightmarish that task would be. You're talking about maintaining order in one of the most densely populated regions of the world, *for years*, after months of incredibly bloody urban fighting. That means not only having to deal with a desperate and hostile population in the aftermath, but also an Israeli public that has seen dozens if not hundreds of their sons and daughters sent home in bodybags, and that's *before* the occupation even begins. *How* do you maintain order? *How* do you prevent PIJ or Hamas remants from trying to pop your soldiers on every street corner? *How* do you convince the Israeli public that it's all worth it after a year of that? 5 years? 10 years? That's the kind of thing that topples governments.If this ends with an IDF victory over Hamas, I absolutely guarantee that any Israeli occupation of Gaza will be very temporary before they hand over control to some third party so they don't have to deal with it anymore. &gt; People living in the Gaza are to my understanding pure leeches, they live on foreign aid which sustains their terror campaigns and the tyrannyYour understanding is wrong. Most of them live (well, *lived*) on Israeli work permits. And if this is your characterization of the general population, I don't really see why you care so much about the tyranny they live under given that you seem to view them as indistinguishable from the regime. I've had the pleasure of meeting some wonderful people from there, just as I've known some wonderful Israelis.
‚ÄúJaffa Kree‚Äù
Thanks I was translating from IDF Arabic video so that's probably why.
Hostages might also tell the press things that don't align with the government propaganda upon release.
Yeah, Hamas was forced onto the Palestinians from Israel so yeah true.
We‚Äôre becoming the very thing we swore to destroy
Then leave.
The Houthi drones are one-way suicide drones that directly impact the target - See the Shahed 136. They can't fire or drop any ordinance, weigh around 450\~ pounds, and only has an 8ft wingspan.The Bayraktar TB2 is a traditional long-endurance UCAV. It can be used for reconnaissance, can fire air-to-surface missiles (UMTAS), and has a wingspan of 40ft.So they are completely different types of drones with different roles and capabilities. ELI5: The Bayraktar TB2 is like more like a traditional plane. While the Shahed 136 is more like a slow moving missile with a camera.
Like, it was driving away..
A lot of American Jews have been paid to move there
Well that was an interesting way to get sucked into a several hour long wiki walk.
There's several articles around stating that the Israelis were scaling back on Tavor adoption.   The gist being it's just not as easy to use as an AR platform for all its advantages.
True and noone can do anything to stop Israel. They're untouchable. They won't be questioned killing babies and innocent people. Netanyahu's goal is a genocide.
Misinformation: "Hamas claimed that X hostages in Y were released peacefully" (despite no other sources than their own twitter account)Schizoposting: "Wouldn't it be funny, if..."
He apparently hasn't worked with israel in over 10 years, now look who's in the spot light
They are guilty of literally everything they accuse Palestinians and Hamas of, almost always to a worse and higher degree.
You likely have been on a plane several times. If you live near a population center you have seen thousands of airplanes in the sky during your lifetime. You have access to hundreds of thousands of youtube videos involving typical plane behavior. You can read entire dissertations about how planes work in painstaking detail.How many deep underground tunnels in sandy terrain near the Ocean have you visited? How many videos have you watched on the matter or how many books have you read (if they even exist)?That's the difference.
I‚Äôd even be willing to wager some or a large portion of people calling for the death of Palestinians are direct descendants of those who bore the horrors of the campsIt‚Äôs disgusting and just utterly depressing.
Someone quick make an edit of a mouse pointer with a dragged green rectangle encompassing the tanks lol

That's the same with about 90% of the world. You're not special. All our ancestors went through the same shit at some point. Time is the only measuring factor that people value in these situations.
That would probably scare away most people so statistically it might actually work better than the mice
What an idiot
What helps the most is that they use child labor. International observers estimate up to 80 of them died while constructing those tunnels for Hamas.
I have heard so much support for that guy here, not sure if things are not that drastic in USA. There was a fire in my hometown at the same time this escalation of Israel-Palestine conflict started and mum and four small kids died. They happened to be muslims (not Arabs) and people were really happy and said it's a good start. We currently have extremely right-wing, Christian government that endorses racism and islamophobia here.
Those poor mice. It's like swinging a live cat above your head to scare off witches.
That's the idea.
I don‚Äôt think they even realise the true damage they are doing to their global support. Just because the Top1% of allied countries that benefits from supporting Israel and happens to run the country at the time are backing them. Doesn‚Äôt mean they will continue to do so when a large majority of the allied countries population changes opinion.

They're being used by Israel more than Hamas, now.  As long as they're prisoners, Israel can continue taking Gaza for themselves.[Last week, Hamas tried to return 2 prisoners for humanitarian reasons and Israel refused to take them, instead opting to ramp up plans for an invasion](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2023/10/20/israel-gaza-war-live-hamas-releases-two-american-captives-from-gaza).  They were eventually handed over to Red Crescent when Israel wouldn't take them.[The US even tried to get Israel to delay the ground invasion to try to get the rest of the hostages, Israel said no.](https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinian-gaza-war-syria-lebanon-hamas-c0e7ec55428fedc97f75bdfdc0c0679a) The ground invasion is more important than getting the hostages.
Why can‚Äôt we differentiate between the bad Israelis and the bad Palestinians, and the good Israelis and the good Palestinians. Why does it have to be either one team or the other
UAS type attacks weren‚Äôt new however. US troops suffered similar attacks by ISIS. I think it‚Äôs more likely they were planning on seeing these attacks. Not to give Russia too much credit but they couldn‚Äôt have just not known that the cope cage would be ineffective against javelin type munitions.

72p Video.
Isreal is a coward land full of weak frail feeble pussy half men. Here's a video of a Israeli "soldier" talking about how it was okay to shoot kids that throw rocks. You see a coward pussy IDF half man would never dare look into the eyes of a real man. They can't. They'll be manhandled and eaten alive. That's why these cowards target children. They lie about hamas using civilians as human shields. No militants have been found in the rubble only civilians. Everybody knows how crooked the zionist Jew is, the Zionist Jew has been running and operating the world's largest concentration camp that humanity is ever seen for the last two decades and systematically killing innocent women, children and men same as what was done to them by the Nazis. The only reason Hamas exists is because Israel illegally occupied and stole land before being negotiated. Viciously murdered more than 20,000 innocent civilians in the naqba and then forced over a million into the Gaza strip concentration camp. and out of that atrocity hamas was born. So you see none of this would have ever even started if the Nazi Zionist Jew were good people and not murderous coward devil half men. I mean if you need any other proof of the Nazi Zionist Jew being a half man. They are the ones in America that own all the media that are pushing the narrative that men can be women. This is most likely due to the fact that their their pussy ass half men men ARE women. That's why their garbage trash IDF soldiers can only kill women and children. Without American money and American military technology, the children of Palestine would murder every IDF soldier. No problem because that's how garbage, trash and pussy they are. https://youtube.com/shorts/Dz_3BFPINnc?si=vYp9GQ2bGUlQ6Zio

Take a look at [this](https://x.com/AdityaRajKaul/status/1719307233014485239?s=20) and probably reconsider saying this. Hamas allowed an RT reporter to go into the tunnels. Look at how deep those go.(200 meters is probably insane, but tens of meters seems highly likely)

Why walk when you can be in a shielded armory?

I‚Äôm pro Ukraine dork ass
There are, also other terrorists and Hamas sympathizers‚Ä¶
Let me get this straight... They decided to attack hospitals and refugee camps, bc there might be terrorists living in the tunnels beneath them... Instead of attacking the leaders safe houses first?
nobody degrades footage quite like the israelis
No "We get you sir!"
I used to play that game when I was in middle school, you just reminded me - seriously thanks that was a good game
"Roll out!"
Last time they wore those yellow stars they didn't pin them on themselves voluntarily.  This is a desperate attempt to play the victim.

Thats... just not true. People do not support that guy by and large period. The people who are out in the streets and organizing these pro Israel demonstrations don't think that was acceptable. 99+% of them know that to be nothing more than a disturbing despicable unprovoked double murder of two innocents for absolutely nothing resembling a reason.  If you really think this please, please,  understand you aren't seeing things for what they are. I'm not sure how much content you've been consuming but I think it's warping your perception of reality and I don't mean that as insulting. It's a scary time and it's easy to fear people and think they're literal monsters but that man will almost certainly die in prison. It's not enough because nothing will bring that woman and her son back but if you think this country would ever ever not convict him as a result of bias against Palestinians you are, thankfully very much mistaken. Don't take this as insulting towards you, you genuinely should not be this afraid and I don't want you or anyone living in this amount of unfounded fear. I genuinely hope you can take a breath here and feel better.
And Israeli settlers in the West Bank have kinda been given the green light to harass, intimidate, and even kill Palestinians. Hamas is terrible and should be destroyed, but Israel is pretty bad as well
OwO
Skin
Except Europe!
Shinto is nice :)
Anti-israel oppression is not antisemitism. We can what they're doing without hating them as a people. We're in some Twilight Zone shit now!
I hate and despise people who still say there's nothing wrong with Israel
And?  Why are you bringing that up?
Those poor innocent mice didn‚Äôt do anything to anybody, but good job with the unnecessarily cruel performative idiocy, I guess.
If allahu akbar means Gods will be done, he sure is proving he doesn‚Äôt want Hamas lol üòÇ
Normally they are a bit pitched up, aren‚Äôt they?
How many were burned alive or beheaded?
Meanwhile Israeli residents have their fancy bomb shelters to run to.
Like a reverse PETA, but equally counter productive to their intended goal.
And orientation day is cumbersome! You need to practice good screaming accent.
Becuse it is intercepted by the Hamas.
No one in their right mind will let the Palestinians into their country. Everyone has seen how that works out.
Came here to ask  this.  Compare/contrast with combat footage in Ukraine, where there is actually an enemy force shooting back.  This isn't combat.  This is demolition.
MFW no cumpit
It is a settlement, as in it is land that has been taken and used to build an outpost community. It was not contested like those in the west bank, as the population around Gaza had already been driven too far away to contest it (till now).Unless the land was owned by Israeli citizens pre-Nakba, it was the property of, and home to the native Arab population. It would under any terms of war be a standard invasion. There is no 'legal' aspect to this. Invasion is not a crime.
Start a group, get a bunch of NTBs (not too bright) to do the killing, move to fancy hotel in Qatar.  Life is good!
So, no gunfire, just Israelis blowing shit up?The contrast with Ukraine combat footage is striking.
7k plus killed already, a third children.
or "that is all".

Funny how when Iraq breaks 2 of them they bombed back to the Stone Age‚Ä¶
I don't think PA would want to work with Israel in that regard. If they are seen cooperating with the IDF they will lose popular support.&gt; I don't think Israel wants control of Gaza.There are plenty of (right wing radical) people in Israel that would love to get Gaza (and the West bank) just without all those pesky Palestinians. The Overall situation is a dilemma for the IDF and Israel as a whole - even if they win militarily there is a high chance no suitable solution will be found. Meaning that in a couple of years we could have the same or an even worse situation in the area as a consequence.Realistically I do not see any chance for lasting peace in the region.
If not advocating for war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and apartheid makes me an anti-semite then damn, I'm an anti-semite for standing on the right side of humanity.It's too bad that Zionists weaponize the term antisemite as it takes away from true Jews who face racism.If Israel truly wants to be treated equally, then they will equally have to abide by international law.  No better, no worse.  But here we are. 75 years of impunity for war crimes, ethnic cleansing, and apartheid as they claim people are racist against them
MODS!!!!?
Not so safe house
Yea the staff turnover is terrible !
&gt; they want to integrate Ukrainians and Ukraineweird way of showing itperhaps you meant integrate them into massive mass graves visible from space ala Mariupol?
Looks like standard infantry, maybe one of the reconnaissance units of the Givati brigade
I‚Äôve been wondering if that is indeed the scenario. It makes sense from a long-term security perspective, but the optics sure won‚Äôt look good ;)Of course, Israel might not be in the mood to care about optics.
That should land him in jail.
Shout out to bulk barn
wtf
The proportion of Gazan military age males fighting with Hamas is high. Gazan support for Hamas is strong but not universal.I don't think Israel wants control of Gaza. They'd love to hand it over to the PA or just about anyone but Hamas.
Would it surprise you to find out that Israelis were xenophobic to the Holocaust survivors that immigrated to the region?https://networks.h-net.org/node/28655/reviews/30636/hoch-yablonka-survivors-holocaust-israel-after-war
It literally is. Russia can‚Äôt do that though because they want to integrate Ukrainians and Ukraine. Israelis do not care about integrating Palestinians and therefore don‚Äôt care if they hate them.
Israel is a terrorist apartheid state
What‚Äôs the plan here? Are they actually trying to occupy the territory they clear or what? Looks like fucking Stalingrad already
Don't you dare tell me to stop dropping bombs on babies!  You are a neo-nazi for not supporting genocide. Yes, we've got to this point in America.  Enjoy!
Yeah once I heard infantry was a lot more getting shelled in a rat-infested wet hole in the ground in winter and very little of gunning down commies it started to sound less fun
I detest Christians too cause they trying to insert their beliefs into our government. I don‚Äôt differentiate between Islam and Christianity, if all religions were gone we would be a more peaceful world. But you guys want to take pity on Muslims but cry about Christian fascists in the US.

He recognized it was the biggest bot farm of all the social media platforms, purchased it saying he was going to delete the bots and in the opposite increase the number of bots while decreasing the number of real people. He now has the most successful propaganda engine of all time. In service to whoever pays him the most or caters him the mostFor over a week Twitter was not showing any hashtags or trending topics related to Gaza. Then a few days ago Netanyahu and Elon had that fight over starlink. Netanyahu cut off all investments from Elon in Israel.Well now you can find Gaza related trending topics on Twitter in the list.It would be hilarious if it wasn't so terrifying that it was in Elon's hands
I cringe whenever these pro-Hamas/pro-Palestine people call the IDF‚Äôs targeted airstrikes ‚Äúcarpet bombs‚Äù, and scream to stop carpet bombing Gaza.It‚Äôs like it pains them to be honest for once. Surely they have seen WW2 documentaries that show what carpet bombing actually looks like.
i love me some armored bulldozers
Public opinion doesn't concern them all that much when the world's strongest military supports their every move.
42% of building have sustained damage, 15% have received moderate to severe damage; according to the UN.[UN statement in THE NEW ARAB](https://www.newarab.com/news/gaza-42-housing-units-destroyed-damaged-israel?amp)
You want your stupid question answered? Yes they would blow the buildings up the same exact way. With the same method and bombs. This is a warzone cupcake. Civilians were told to evacuate by both sides of the war. If they were Israeli citizens theyd be told to gtfo as well.
Nazis were 100x more insane than these bastards but Israel is getting there day by day. If 2.5 million Palestine die, even then the UN is not gonna do anything. This is because they would rather see innocents die than loosing a strong foothold on the middle east. Remember this Israel currently is the strongest middle eastern country out there.
The reason we get all this footage of buildings being knocked down is because the IDF warns Gaza ahead of time where they're going to bomb to limit casualties.
Israel and it‚Äôs zionist citizens are trying *really* hard to show the world they in fact are really sucky people who don‚Äôt deserve unconditional support in bombing civillians.
Smell my finger
Come and see the censorship inherent in the system!Help! Help! I'm being repressed!
They became nazis themself. Disgusting
Honestly this is disgusting.
Well hurry up and occupy us finally!
Agreed. That was a shameful piece of acting from the green player.
Damn, what happened to that build is akin to a human taking a shot to the spine. It just folded.
That's why Elon will charge 1$ per year for using twitter ....it's easy to code a software that can mass create account and then spamming twitter to game the algorithm

i wonder how hamas telecommution works inside tunnel
So you're saying christians dont bomb abortion clinics, or ~~patriots~~ MAGA dont commit insurrection, perhaps those people in Charlottesville were just peaceful protesters and those damned communists and antifa just threw themselves in front of that car.Whataboutism is the playground of small minds and children, which are you?
Jesus man. No one is on Hamas' side. Just stop killing kids is all people are saying.
The term antisemitism is anything said or done against Jews, not supporting them is antisemitism.
Past 75 years. FTFY
As I said it's very effective.I've also noticed that Israel keeps slowly leaking more and more footage from October 7th. Every day it seems as if we're getting a couple new videos that they have not released before. Trying to keep October 7th fresh in everyone's mind. New. Continue to shock people so they ignore what they are doing in Gaza.Like during the Iraq and Afghan Wars there were times where many people were protesting. But you really didn't share your protest against those Wars around 9/11. Everybody was being reminded of what kicked it all off and less people were willing to speak against the wars then.During the war in chechnya Putin kept reminding people over and over about the apartment bombings. Constantly running them on nightly News to remind people why they were trying to erase a group of people and their largest City. They are currently doing that with the Odessa building that caught on fire and killed russians. Reminding Russians of that while waging War in Ukraine.It just works
The war on terror is coming, all the fighting age Muslim males who gained asylum in western countries. We are going to be seeing serious terrorism against civilians in the Western world.
That doesn't look very safe.
Now it's a flat....
If Hitler had tik tok:
UN peacekeepers went to vacation, never came back
A water trap is very low tech.  It's like a scaled up version of the U bend in the plumbing under your kitchen sink.  It's not perfect, anyone moving through it would have to get wet.  But it's well within Hamas' capabilities to build.
Thanks for the link. Asking for substantive evidence of harm to back Israel‚Äôs claims is not one sided when there are daily videos coming from Gaza of exploded children. Especially considering everyone keeps saying ‚Äú1400‚Äù but Haaretz says ‚Äú1300‚Äù but then lists ‚Äú1000‚Äù and then many of them are soldiers &amp; police. https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-19/ty-article-magazine/israels-dead-the-names-of-those-killed-in-hamas-massacres-and-the-israel-hamas-war/0000018b-325c-d450-a3af-7b5cf0210000Fuck the actions of Hamas but also fuck the disproportionate response of Israel indiscriminately carpet bombing children. Down voters need to go look at some non-western media and reports from the ground in gaza. https://instagram.com/motaz_azaizathis is a good place to start.
There‚Äôs a video from yesterday of Israeli neighborhoods cheering every time they‚Äôre heard a bomb exploding in the distanceEdit: here it is https://fixupx.com/ShaykhSulaiman/status/1718575905956831340?s=20
First of all, this is an active war zone under evacuation orders. Civilians are not supposed to be there. Secondly, Israel has provided numerous examples of hamas weapon stockpiles inside of schools, mosques, hospitals, etc and hamas even admits to their existence. Thirdly, if Hamas were to be close enough to Israeli citizens to store weapons, they would have massacres those civilians long before storing any supplies there. Invalid argument.
He now resides in a flat.....
This is a false premise. For example, Israeli settlers want their children to grow up safe, on somebody else‚Äôs land in the West Bank. This requires the continuation of occupation, land theft, and apartheid. Similarly, Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza want their children to grow up safe. This explicitly requires an end to Israeli military occupation and blockades. So there absolutely are two sides here. Creating some false idealistic third side that doesn‚Äôt exist in reality, is simply disingenuous. Furthermore, acting as if taking a side against Israel somehow undermines the safety of Israeli children in Israel proper, is also disingenuous.

Yeah I only came aware of this a few years ago. When trump tweeted that high res satalite picture that wasn't degraded. That shit was so scrisp.
I think the qualifier is that it's a VERY limited defense against anything. A drone or RPG could still very much hit the top of the tank, they simply made it harder.
God speed boys
They get a bigger say in our country than any state.
This guys comment really summed it up perfectly: [https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/17kg51i/comment/k77lszg/?context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/17kg51i/comment/k77lszg/?context=3)  &gt;They conflate antisemitism with anti-zionism, thereby giving validation  to every genuine antisemite out there.  They are saying "if you don't  like what we're doing you hate Jews" and a lot of people (especially  muslims) are thinking "OK so we hate Jews then".  I'm sure it sucks to  be Jewish right now.  Antisemitism is on the rise and the Israeli  government are the assholes making it happen.
Israel has provided photographic evidence of munitions stockpiles in schools, mosques, hospitals, etc.Hamas has admitted they store weapons there. Palestinians civilians admit there are weapons stored there. Who exactly do you not believe?
There is a process to get stuff out of military network.And the program doing that will degrade images and videos because it's quite a shitty program.
Based on the last three weeks, they'll definitely give it the old college try.

I want a book of these where there are hidden pictures of Saddam. Kind of like a where's waldo book.
(Two tanks get left behind)WTF?! I DID SELECT ALL!
No, I can't prove God isn't real either.Proving a negative is very hard. As far as I was aware, the IDF didn't say they had stopped roof knocking - just that they wouldn't always be using it.
I'm saying you because you‚Äôre extremely biased towards Israel, you seem Zionist.Israel's ‚Äúnation‚Äù existed as a minority in historic Palestine for many centuries* I fixed it for you.Of course there is no Palestinian ethnic group, they‚Äôre Arabs (I don‚Äôt know if you realize how stupid what you said is). That doesn‚Äôt give any terrorist the right to attack them and take their lands.Palestinians have been associated with terrorism after they started to defend themselves against (1) mass European Jewish immigration, who planned to take on Palestine since the 20s. (2) They started fighting the Jewish terrorist groups in the civil war, the Jewish terrorist groups weren‚Äôt called ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù explicitly because they were backed by European countries which didn‚Äôt want Jews in their country. (3) Started fighting Israel's occupation, apartheid and terrorism. That‚Äôs how the world works.There are literally more Palestinians in the surrounding countries than in Palestine itself, why would they take more Palestinians in? Why would the Palestinians leave their country? I don‚Äôt understand this point, why don‚Äôt the Jews go back to their original countries in Europe, Arabia or Africa? Because no one wants them back. If you call this anti Semitic then you need help, I'm just giving you your medicine.Israel is a flawed democracy ruled by a terrorist government. That doesn‚Äôt make it any better than Jordan that has a practical form of democracy with monarch authorities that makes it on paper ‚Äúauthoritarian‚Äù, but in reality, Netanyahu is like a monarch there right now. And sure, there are amazing Israeli people, scientists and technicians, what's up with that. It doesn‚Äôt change that Israel is a terrorist state and Zionism is as bad as Hamas' ideology.After the 1948 war, Palestinians were the most educated and wise Arabs, they went to other Arabic countries and became teachers, scientists, lawyers, prime ministers and some wrote constitutions and so on and at this very time, Israelis were a bunch of terrorist gangs who can only terrorize and fight. So don‚Äôt be hypocritical, Palestinians now don‚Äôt have the privileges to become scientists and great people, they need to get their rights first.Don‚Äôt ever forget how the whole country started though, by Jewish terrorist gangs (The Haganah, Irgun and many others) who kept launching terrorist attacks against Palestinians and the Brits until the war happened and those terrorist gangs took over the country. The only difference now is that they wear suits.What evidence do you have of Hamas (which doesn‚Äôt represent Palestinians, but you seem to lose this fact a lot) uses aid money to just build tunnels and missiles? Who do you think builds Gaza after it's destroyed by Israel's terrorism? Who builds mosques, schools, universities and hospitals? They have a whole government there and protecting their people as well. You are too blind if you think Israel's occupation of the West Bank is peaceful, and I'm not sure if you know about the terrorist settlers in the West Bank, who walk around with rifles and never get held accountable if they murder someone.And Israel gets more annual military aid than Hamas does in 3-4 years, they provoke and oppress Palestinians in the West Bank AND they disrespect and dance in Al Aqsa knowing Hamas will defend their people. I know you probably have no idea what‚Äôs going on in the West Bank and just hopped in to see what‚Äôs up after the 7th of Oct. (apparent from your views and the things you‚Äôre saying) you were just fed Zionist propaganda and being blind now.
Is that like E621?
Not just degraded, but also very much cropped.
Asshole Trump and maga supporters.
I am an American. I pay taxes. I feel shameful of my government supporting genocide.
Hamas was weaponizing cancer omg /s
They belong to a religious death cult. They don‚Äôt care about dying.
It‚Äôs really a shame that you‚Äôre right, and it‚Äôs a shame that Zionism has been conflated with Judaism to the point that to be anti-Zionist is to be antisemitic. There are Jewish people who aren‚Äôt Zionist but they will be lumped in with these people.
Only its not.  That's just some far east propaganda word to simplify what actually happened here.Apartheid, is closer related to Arabic countries pushing the jews out. Multiple diplomatic solutions have been offered. There's no race or religion requirement to living in Israel. It's not segregated based on race either, its segregated based on the actions of extremists. It's no different than the people of Texas requesting stronger border security, a larger wall at the Mexican border to prevent violence from spilling into the USA.But yeah, tell me about that one documentary you saw on VICE TV.  I'm sure their information is top notch and not at all meant for profit.
Damn
It's not supposed to result in a military victory, they're not deluding themselves about defeating the IDF.Hamas are targeting stuff that causes political turmoil, fatigue in the population about the situation and attracts international attention. Basically killing civilians. IRA, ETA and multiple other terrorist organisations did this.They likely factored in the massively lopsided civilian casualty numbers into invoking international sympathies. They wanted to rile the IDF so badly that they'd go overboard and enter Gaza in force, get into a quagmire and lose soldiers and cause civilian casualties as collateral damage.Hamas is hiding behind civilians, Israel is shooting despite that at targets but minimizing/justifying civilian casualties as they can.This is not a pretty or a just war. A fucked up situation where both sides have been killing civilians, kids and causing people to hate each other more and more.
It's really hard to accept that my tax dollars are used for this bullshit.
Ever watch hockey.
Classic
They talked about that hospital for a week while ignoring that food and water was cut off for millions of civilians
Textbook example of tripping over your words.
By this logic it would be all fair and square if the Russian government just stated that Kyiv is now an active combat zone and than bomb lvl the entire place, the Israeli government literally tells people to leave their houses or suffer the consequences (blackmailing) and people still try to justify this with their mental gymnastics.
Sounds like you‚Äôre pro human. Anti psychotic.
You mean Eisenhower's D-Day speech

Yeah, they shouldn't have picked a fight with a chainsaw.
We need more of him all over the world.
I really doubt Hamas engineers managed water locks that work well enough in a scenario where Israel owns the surface
Sad days for a human society. SMH
With all the destruction and displacement of thousands the general population is probably already aligned with them.It will be interesting to see how the IDF approaches this challenge and if they repeat the same mistakes other nations did when trying to do COIN.
Some IDF tanks have cope cages?
Biden made them turn it back on apparently.
The immigrants are ruining Canada, this behavior is not acceptable They immigrate to a developed country but bring the same behavior
So you saying Islam hasn‚Äôt been used to carry out terrorist acts?
Exactly. Total US deaths from both of the battles of Fallujah is just over 100 men. Russia likely lost at least 100 times that in their year long campaign to take Bakhmut which is 5 times smaller.
*Halo Wars flashbacks intensify*
What SOF unit is that? That's a pretty cool patch on his helmet.
We will see, Hamas is such a small entity though and will struggle against a force this size. If the general population starts to align with the military wing then it could get very problematic very soon.
Most of the people from the communities that were attacked in october the 7th - certainly most of the people from the Kibutzim - were very much anti-Netanyahu. The kibutzim are seen as connected to the "old guard" of Zionism that had socialist agendas, and his political enemies. It is more than likely that this woman has never voted for him in her life.One of the big tragedies of that day, that a lot of the people who were killed and kidnapped were actually pro-peace and anti-settlements, people who were peace activists their whole lives. Fat load of good it did to them because I don't think Hamasniks ask people what they voted before they kill them
These are degraded
Fuck them up Israel.  The world is with you.  Not so easy for these fuckers when they aren‚Äôt fighting a defenseless music festival.
He is a traitor, worked as a double agent for Hamas and Mossad...you can never trust anything a person like that says.
Who‚Äôs even still supporting these clowns at this point?
He keeps saying god is great despite god seemingly not being so great. Religion is weird.
That degradation is kinda insane, though makes sense, it's a very active scene with troops on the ground
I just said that I prefer the left 4 dead, not that you're wrong
I see a lot of comments asking about the smurf, or chef hats... that Israeli soldiers wear. The helmets are called ‚ÄúMitznefet‚Äù  Here's some interesting info on them, for those interested.   ‚ÄúMitznefet‚Äù is about disguising a precision-cut ballistic helmet in the asymmetry of nature.The Mitznefet breaks up the shape of a helmet and makes it considerably more difficult to spot from a distance. In a natural landscape, an IDF or MICH helmet‚Äôs perfectly round dome sticks out like a sore thumb and the less lines an enemy marksman has to attach crosshairs to, the better.    The word Mitznefet, actually comes from the name of the headgear that was worn by the Jewish High Priest, in the Holy Temple in Jerusalem.   For more details about this ingenious uniform piece, here's some further reading if anyone is interested.   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitznefet_(Israeli_military)   Or, here;   https://agilitegear.com/blogs/news/why-do-israeli-soldiers-wear-chef-hats

&gt; which prevents the free movement of defenders.That's why Hamas has tunnels, they are not stupid.They either force the IDF into tunnel clearing which is a nightmare or can constantly raid and re-occupy cleared areas.

General Butt Naked told me in a wet dream. It WAS divine.
Netanyahu would describe them as "self-hating".
Clearly they are more civilized right? At least that's what ALL of western media is telling me.
They probably won't give back the North part of Gaza that they are currently cutting off from the rest of Gaza according to [this map](https://israelpalestine.liveuamap.com/en/2023/31-october-the-israeli-military-is-present-inside-exoutpost) . Once the siege of remaining Hamas is done and empty of population. I don't see why they would not bulldozer everything there. This would also limit the rocket attack range if they create some kind of buffer there and reduce the size of the border to secure
Not really useful as a mosquito net but can block the sun. It does look stupid in many cases.
If dude doesn't also harrass his own government of their treatment of aboriginals and what they're actively doing to right their racism and wrongs of their own genocide, then yeah. He'd lose respect. But imho, anyone who is able to see and call out hypocrisy and injustice should be free and encouraged to do so.
Links for that? Would love to read it
It is not a stretch that they would prioritize themselves over civilians.
the parts that were attacked on October 7th aren't considered settlements though. The status of places like Be'eri is totally different from Jewish settlements in the West Bank. They would have no legal ground for "retaking" them.
From the link:&gt; She has served as a trainer and combat instructor for the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Her extensive background knowledge in martial arts played a key part in helping her land the role of Wonder Woman.
That's a great idea, a gradual cooperative ceasefire. Also, if there aren't already, it would be nice to have a joint effort refugee program between nations to get the innocents out of Gaza
Most people here are pro-Palestine and as such will excuse people being obvious shitheads about it and dogpile those who point it out.

I wonder if this shit is cringe for any regular Jewish peeps. It just seems like a shit situation whare no one is really in the right but these Zionist types are just wild'n out. Thrs like a million vids on the internet of Jews doing some despicable ass shit and then calling everybody antisemites when they get called out on it. I mean, thrs gotta be some jews out thr that are just embarrassed beyond belief.
They're trying to convince the lowest common denominator by making a false equivalence that those who don't unconditionally support Israel today are as bad as Nazis in the 1930s.They know this is smoothbrained reasoning. Everyone at the UN knows this is smoothbrained reasoning. But some people who are at home in Israel might see this and be convinced that blowing up civilian buses and cars trying to drive away is actually preventing another Holocaust and rally support for them. Some people around the world in democratic countries might be smoothbrained and think this is sound reasoning and try to convince their governments to take Israel's side.
CO2 and CO both works but these are invisible gases. Odourless and clear.The idea here is to flush anyone out from the tunnels, Hamas and/or the hostages. Therefore smoke works.

Spool of wire.Although there have been some significant advancements in underground wireless comms, still limited of course.
This is what IDF wants. At some point they will require the people to move back, while they are filtering the population coming trough the checkpoints. Large cities have to be sliced into small areas of control which prevents the free movement of defenders.
From their half hearted Allah Akbar game and generally muted reaction, i presume he wasnt the greatest neighbour to have.
Yep. It's not like we didn't get used to detecting that stuff over the past 2 years with russia. But now it's just happening so much from so many different accounts but it's hard to keep track. Impossible to block them all.They also successfully infiltrated multiple communities online and shifted the opinion in their favor. Or at least suppressed counter opinion driving those people out of the community. So it's more like the rapid and efficient growth of Qanon on social media. They spread themselves into multiple conspiracy theory groups, linked the groups BS to their own BS and suppressed anyone who said otherwise. Flat Earth used to be funny. Now it's a subset of Qanon
many israelis are calling for genocide too. cannot deny it
How can anyone defend this? Even if you don't agree that Palestine should exist, this is just fucked up on so many levels.
This is literally part of war, the civilians of the enemy are worth less than your own‚Ä¶ this is by the very nature of war existing primarily to protect the lives and interests of your own civilians and/or allied civilians.
Looks like something Lester would give you to hack a bank in GTA 5

You need to be a Muslim and also you have to force a lot of civilians under your tyranny. Then you can get the money for terror operations.

Agreed. Only I should have the right to dox my own dreams.
Didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be hearing a *wullah wackbar* on this one‚Ä¶but I did. Also, with all the BS about the IDF ‚Äúnot‚Äù giving notices, they sure seem to know exactly where to point the camera.
one failed state supporting other failed state.its only a matter of time that India will flatten them too.
At this depth you deal with hard rock and hard rock mining, which needs to use explosives, at certain spots perhaps but unlikely to be widespread, i agree that most tunnels are shallow and can be detected with ground penetrating radar quite well i suppose. Also, tunnels need air, there must either be many generators somewhere or one huge one, no matter what, its possible to spot a tunnel from that alone, exhausts, heat signature etc.The tunnels are hyped up to no end but in reality they are coffins that harbor certain death to those that inhabit them if the IDF has the surface under control, getting rid of the tunnels wont be the issue that many think it will be, if they (the IDF) knows what they doing.
There are no words to describe this. Gloating in the face of innocent people suffering.  This is a good way to turn public opinion throughout the world.
They said the exact same type of shit about slaves. They accused them of all being violent rapists at their core, only able to exist if they‚Äôre tamed by their masters. Oppressors will use dehumanizing rhetoric against entire groups of people in order to convince others to turn a blind eye to their abuse.
Apartheid
Exploding babies heads while simultaneously equating themselves with holocaust victims is beyond low and sickening. These fuckers truly have no shame
Also Israel has a LOT of very smart and plugged in adtech companies. I worked with a ton of these guys , it's pretty impressive how they clearly switched from pushing Raid shadow legends etc to pro Israel narratives in like 2 days.

That's what racist white south africans said about the ethnic majority they wished to subjugate.  As it is what racist defenders of the racist, genocidal aparthied state of Israel say about the ethnic majority Israel wishes to subjugate.
where was UN when Hamas is continuously attacking and killing Israelis.No cease fire now because hamas will regroup.If its that much concern for UN maybe he should take all the refugees to his UN head quarters.

Ah yes because the civilians being bombed don't also want safety and freedom."Do you condemn the actions of Nate Turner? The south has a right to defend itself" - you if I could throw your ass back 200 years.
I‚Äôve spent some time listening to them in Philly and you summed up the experience perfectly. It‚Äôs shocking to see them being pro Israel considering the amount of intensely antisemitic rhetoric I‚Äôve heard them use. Truly a baffling group.

So many removed comments
IDF is already [cutting Gaza in half](https://israelpalestine.liveuamap.com/en/2023/31-october-the-israeli-military-is-present-inside-exoutpost) and trap all Hamas that was in the North part and they can just siege them and take them out little by little. The North part of Gaza will be part of Israel soon that is all Hamas won 1/2 Gaza left.
Monsieur l‚ÄôMayor! You‚Äôll wear a different chain!
Israel are doing the right thing. Offensive towards the invaders.Fully support. Its like tit for tat.Its like Hamas started and Israel will finish.Kudos to Israel.

Why is anti-Israel and anti-semitism conflated? Like Israel, is a country! Judaism is a religion. Why is it that being anti-israeli abuse on palestinians is seen as taboo?
This is correct. Roof knocks don‚Äôt occur when they are targeting a Hamas official inside the house for obvious reasons. Roof knocks do occur when they are targeting safe houses, logistical centers, launch sites, tunnel entrances, supply/storage warehouses, etc. They are more liberal with their attacks in the north since they have warned civilians to flee south otherwise they would be considered Hamas. These messages were delivered continually over the past 2 weeks.

Tasmania down there saying, ‚ÄúCould you keep down that racket? I‚Äôm trying to bang me sister.‚Äù
It's crazy what, "God said I could kill you" can result in.
jfc..... So you've shifted your argument from the Israeli defense minister lying to Hamas keeping people in buildings forcefully?I mean I don't even need to ask. Everyone can see that's what you've done here.And again we come back to the point that no Hamas troops or people with guns have been seen anywhere around Gaza in weeks. Cause hamas all went underground. There have been no guards standing around with guns. Nobody driving on the back of technicals with big machine guns. None of that.So before you actually suggest Hamas is keeping them at gunpoint in their apartments you need to actually provide even one piece of evidence. Because nobody has been able to do that yet. Plenty of assumptions but nothing in the past few weeks that has suggested that is actually taking place.Even Israel doesn't have that evidence. All they have is one barricade place on one road that was quickly removedKeep spreading propaganda that contradicts the Israeli government. Seems to be what your best at
Unless you want massive friendly casualties. Hamas was probably hoping to engage in house to house combat, it's why they're hiding behind civilians but Israel is bombing their rat tunnels anyway.
Zionists totally lack that level of introspection. I've just had the joy of encountering one that claimed turning off water for 2.4 million people is actually legal and justified.

You mean the video that independent experts went on to review and say wasn‚Äôt the missile that hit the hospital?I genuinely don‚Äôt know who or what blew up that particular hospital. No one really does because all the intelligence agencies only released data to reflect what they want.It‚Äôs also kinda irrelevant to me. Everyone focused on one bomb when 10,000+ other bombs have killed 10,000 other people. Whether the IDF hit that hospital or just hit 10,000 other targets is kinda irrelevant

If you truly think about it these guys are worse than Nazis considering the sheer fact Germany was under tremendous pressure due to losses in WW1 and the debt which led to Hitler‚Äôs rise but Israel is nothing like that instead they are the ones oppressing Gaza for the past decade or so and also the reason Hamas exists. They have been taking Palestinian land inch by inch and protected by the west like its their baby or something. No country is without fault but this might just be the biggest blemish on democracy, and liberalism and especially on US who fiercely protects Israel.

What says that the people who‚Äôve been warned that their house is going to be bombed will leave said house? I can‚Äôt prove this, but it would make sense that the people would either stay in their houses on their own accord or are told to stay in place by Hamas to be made martyrs and headlines
Both of my statements are true. Not least that ethno-religious states are anti-democratic, even without the whole apartheid stuff.Respectfully, I prefer people to be honest.

I mean how.? Neo Nazis are calling for eradication of anyone  that doesn‚Äôt meet their qualifications. Folks protesting the war on Gaza are saying ‚Äústop, please stop!‚Äù Meanwhile, Israel citizens (not all) are making ‚Äúfunny‚Äù videos about the suffering of the Palestinians and calling them animals.I am failing to see the similarities between NeoNazis and those calling for an end to the genocide of Palestinians in Gaza.

WE PLAY HARD AND WE PLAY FAIR AND WERE IN HARMONY
Thank you for a real answer, for a change.I don‚Äôt think Israel in itself is special in any way. I do believe that military action is inevitable under the current circumstances, especially when you have the threat of another 10.7 on the line. I think whatever kind of action is necessary to prevent such a calamity, where nearly 0.02% of the population has perished in a day. I don‚Äôt want to bring up emotions, but the way those ppl perished (e.g. rape) has a huge, additional effect beyond the simple numbers on the overall fear of a future attack. Therefore, I believe that Israel has an obligation to its ppl, as a sovereign country, to prevent that from ever happening again.I believe that ‚Äúbuilding rapport‚Äù with Gazans, as things currently stand, is a lost cause, and even, frankly, fantasy-ish. I do believe that the end goal for Israelis should be improving quality of life, education etc in Gaza and the West Bank, and to gradually cease any military action towards them. I do believe it should be gradual, and done with cooperation from both sides (e.g. IDF decreases bombings, in exchange for Hamas to decrease missile shootings). Unfortunately, the way things are in the Middle East today are horrific. For middle eastern countries, simply offering a unilateral ceasefire would *never* be seen as Israel striving for peace, but as weakness. I know this is fucked up, but as an someone from Israel, that has seen these things happen dozens of times before, and just knowing first hand how middle eastern mentality is, I can say with 100% confidence that I trust this judgment. To get to your question, Hamas is entrenched deeply in civilian infrastructure. It‚Äôs one of their signature moves since their start. We have absolutely no feasible tactic for annihilating said rocket launchers other than air strikes. It is unrealistic to send spec ops to target said launchers in the middle of Gaza, it‚Äôs not their role. Mind you, these rockets target Israeli civilians too. And Hamas‚Äô rocket technology is rapidly increasing in accuracy. If it wasn‚Äôt for the Iron Dome, Israel would have probably hundreds more casualties. It‚Äôs also unrealistic to wage land warfare without air support, since that would translate to so many IDF deaths, and moreover, might compromise the chance of winning. I know, Israeli soldiers‚Äô lives are not more valuable than Gazans, ofc, without even considering children. I also agree with that, and it really pains my heart. But looking at the numbers alone is misleading and free of much needed nuance. The vast majority of the Gazan casualties are human shields that have known  that they‚Äôre gonna die, and were either willing to stay there or unable to leave due to Hamas‚Äô actions. Not all, but the vast majority. It is also important to note how there were about as many Palestinian deaths as there were air strikes, so that means the bombings are not indiscriminate and are actually precision bombings, targeting military points.On a side note, I fucking DESPISE the Israeli government, settlers, and anti-Arab rhetoric in this country. I even fucking hate Israel, and do not consider it to be my country, only where I come from. I‚Äôm terribly ashamed of many things this country has done, but I still believe that we have a right to exist, and the mere notion of existing is at stake here, due to future attacks and how all countries under Iranian influence are eyeing Israel, looking to judge how they perform rn in Gaza.
Garbage people.
Don‚Äòt force us to do make another rule update to a rule that shouldn't even have been necessary‚Ä¶

I should‚Äôve been more specific. I was referring to people from the Arab world, basically where I‚Äôm from. Referring to your comment, unfortunately people do tend to forget or gloss over all kinds of atrocities when they happen miles away. Rwanda? Yemen? Myanmar? ‚Ä¶This particular war will be ingrained in our region for generations. And yes, I do expect others to move on. But we won‚Äôt forget.
Might as well throw Raqqa in there too.
But no time to set them up before they get got.
They have guided anti tank missiles, drones, IEDs, suicide vests‚Ä¶etc. It‚Äôs not going to be a cake walk for these vehicles.
going to be weird in the future when 'cope cage' becomes a common usage term.
This doesn't seem to fit the definition of [close air support](https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR1233.html) to me.  Where are the friendly troops?
"Marleen?  Is that YOU in this here video?!"
&gt;No, Israel is attacking to eliminate Hamas not to take gaza We'll see about that.
&gt; Stupid Prizes to naughty Hamas TerroristsAnd a few thousand children. Whether you think this operation is justified or not, lets not get too excited about something that's getting thousands of kids killed. Everything that's happened since October 7th has been a massive tragedy.
Switch your dreams to Duckduckgo
&gt;There are still roof knocks in southern Gaza, where civilians evacuated to.I have a bunch of videos that can disprove that but you probably won't accept even one of them. Like the apartment building in Khan Yunis that was hit a couple days ago.Answer me one thing. Just one question**If they are warning people and giving them time to get out why are there hundreds of Palestinians climbing over the rubble with backhoes trying to get people out of there?**Do you think they're just trying to get their clothes and TVs out of the rubble? At least use some common sense hereLook I don't care. They can bomb the hell out of these people and I'm not going to bat an eye. I'm just trying to point out that you are very wrong. They are not warning anyone in Gaza anymore. Only the West Bank.From the mouth of the Israeli defense minister himself. So until he says otherwise you can't convince me the opposite is happening. In the end you are spreading propaganda that contradicts the Israeli military's own words
The world watches both sides and they can easily figure out we support bombings of civilians.  The don't hate us for our freedom, they hate us because our policies of bombing civilian targets.
It was effective enough to kill 1500 civilians in one day.
You could‚Äôve kept that to yourself and saved a few seconds of my life. BOOM! DOWNVOTED! (jk)
No, and it's going to make everything worse for everyone involved, Palestinians and Israelis. There's no workable plan for afterward; neither Israel nor the Palestinian Authority have the capacity to maintain control of Gaza city. *If* the IDF is able to root out Hamas, which is far from assured, there's nothing to replace it with, and Palestinian Islamic Jihad is just waiting in the wings.
In the words of bassen Youssef: " I have never seen a victim of oppression bomb their oppressor 24/7".
See: now your story changes; before you were justifying Hamas‚Äô terrorist acts by claiming Palestinians were angered by 75 years of alleged genocidal goals. But now you‚Äôve changed your story to Palestinians being justified at trying to eliminate at an Jewish state simply for existing in a place where Palestinians (Jews and Arabs) already lived. (Although you left out the fact that the Palestinian Arabs voted against having their own state that would have been created alongside with Isreal). But here‚Äôs the thing: no matter what story you choose to start telling, it will never justify the indiscriminate targeting of innocent civilians.
 Of course not. It‚Äôs an ongoing weird inside joke that Australia and New Zealand exist and it‚Äôs a shame that a lot of newcomers just accept it out of fear of looking foolish if they question something that contradicts the reality they see with their eyes. Everyone knows those two countries are just funhouse mirror caricatures of the US and Canada that were hastily thrown together by the Br**ish in the early twentieth century when they needed to invent fictitious colonies from which their WW1 suicide corps hailed.Source: Google it.
If anyone defends this you are mental
Bullies break down and cry and scream and piss when you stop them.
If these are people who immigrated to Canada, they deserve to be arrested and put on a plane back to wherever they came from at their families expense.We shouldn't tolerate this shit here. It's a privilege to live here. It's a cheaper option than wasting taxpayer money on keeping them in jail, or having a trial that takes years to resolve only for the people to end up getting a slap on the wrists.
The IDF itself posted this video, and I don't think they post snuff videos where you see people actually die
&gt;But they stopped with the warnings and roof knocks in Gaza- That's incorrect:- There are no roof knocks in **northern Gaza**, which is a designated combat zone under mandatory evacuation order for civilians. Only combatants are supposed to be there.- There are still roof knocks in **southern Gaza**, where civilians evacuated to.
They've been doing this very well actually. Like we're all used to Russian propaganda but what Israel is doing is leaps and bounds more effective.Like when the hospital was hit and everybody started tweeting about itNext thing you know one of the top trending hashtags on Twitter was Hamas=Isis. Countless account spamming that over and over and over suppressing almost anything that came out of Gaza related to the hospital.They do the same thing here.We saw a video get posted of a tank blowing up a car. So they started posting a video of a Hamas soldier blowing up a car. They were posting that as much as they could to try and suppress the video of the Israeli tank doing the same thing.This is the difference between a bot farm running propaganda and a true PsyOp. Which is why the entire globe is so twisted over this.
We‚Äôre so fucked.
They are actually happy they are taking Gaza in few weeks the settlers going to move in
Then you are handing the white house to trump on a silver platter. Look, I get it. I really do, but if u think trup is a better overall pick, then go right ahead.I hate this too. I hate it. Yet I'm not going to hand the white house to trump over it.
Lol I heard so many people say "at least the Israelis don't celebrate the death of their enemy". People are so dumb out there.
If we're nitpicking, the word "commander" in the opening is actually "head", a code for the commander. Great speech. God's speed.
Israel has repeatedly tried to come to a peace agreement but the Palestinians decided they would rather go with Hamas who openly stated they wanted nothing less than the eradication of Israel despite knowing that would never be a realistic option. So Israel is just as bad for dealing with a neighbor who launches suicide missions and would have killed them all if they had the same military capability? If you repeatedly ask for peace and are denied are you really the problem? Honestly Palestinians would be better off under Israeli governance. They are undoubtedly less misogynistic, racist and homophobic. Why do Palestinians need another country to suppress women and minorities in so bad that they are willing to do something like the Hamas attack to fight for it?

What?! A professional military employing proper military censorship?! But how will little timmy enjoy his combat footage on reddit?! Outrageous, I say!
Netanyahu just a few days ago announced in a press conference that the hostages will not be returned until Hamas is completely irradiated. That both will be done at the same time.In other words, he plans to kill everyone.
This is legitimately a UN sanctioned Holocaust, I mean how can you think that amount of hatred is something you should support, but we can't have international issues with our allies now can we, even if they're shitting on human rights.
Mary Ann Williamson and Dean Phillips are already running against Biden so is Cenk Uygur but he wasn't born a US citizen so he is automatically out.

If someone runs against Biden of course I'll vote for them in the primaries, but it will be Biden vs R. If you think anyone in the Democratic party will run against the current one term president you are being hopeful. They won't. They might make a show of it for a couple months but they won't. It will come down to Biden vs Republican, and right now with the polls the Republicans aren't going to risk a loss and at this point I want nothing more than to see Biden lose. After 26 years of voting lesser evil, I'm done. Oh well.
Fitting that this would be the next video to come up on my feed after seeing one of a Palestinian father holding his dying baby in his arms. But, you know, they have a right to defend themselves. /s

Yeah that‚Äôs right.

There is no squadron in our Air Force by that number
This was their (Hamas') intention. They wanted to draw the Israeli Army into the alleys and tunnels, surrounded by civilians.
It's a reference to [this video from Perun](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVqGEtPj0M0) using a war between the two as a scenario.
Don't you mean 3.0?  Both Fallujah battles were much less bloody for the attacker than the other battles.
It's not religion, it's settler-colonialism and imperialism. Religion is just their cover.Everything is downstream of money. Understand that, and you understand all of history.
Ngl i agree with the sentiment but comments like these just feel ignorant to me. Do you really think people are incapable of forgetting warcrimes? If people hadn't "forgotten" what happens when we concede power to fascists (WW2/The Holocaust) then we wouldn't have allowed this or any other genocide to occur ever again. I mean that was the point of telling people not to forget about a tragedy... so that it never happens again. The shit that Israel is pulling here to me can easily happen again and again and again because most people either don't care or don't bother to educate themselves properly and end up siding with propaganda. The very few peoppe who will allow this tragedy to remain in their psyche are in the minority and therefore have no collective power to do anything. Those people wont forget sure but to Israel, they dont matter even a little. People can and will forget this and sooner than you think. Ukraine is still getting bodied contunously by a nation with more wealth and supposed military power than them and most people who live far enough to not be affected by it have already moved on. It sucks but this is the reality of the situation. You can't even blame them because  people tend to be apathetic when they are overworked to the point of exhaustion.
Hamas is w/ hookers in Illinois, confirmed

It‚Äôs actually quite the opposite.  The water table in a large portion of Gaza is actually very deep.  Ranging from 35 to 95m in depth.  So deep tunnels are very much a possibility.

Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.
"Yes, go on," said Marvin to the huge battle machine, "you'll never   guess."    "Errmmm..." said the machine, vibrating with unaccustomed   thought, "laser beams?"    Marvin shook his head solemnly.    "No," muttered the machine in its deep guttural rumble, "Too   obvious. Anti-matter ray?" it hazarded.    "Far too obvious," admonished Marvin.    "Yes," grumbled the machine, somewhat abashed, "Er... how about   an electron ram?"    This was new to Marvin.    "What's that?" he said.    "One of these," said the machine with enthusiasm.    From its turret emerged a sharp prong which spat a single lethal   blaze of light. Behind Marvin a wall roared and collapsed as a heap of   dust. The dust billowed briefly, then settled.    "No," said Marvin, "not one of those."    "Good though, isn't it?"    "Very good," agreed Marvin.    "I know," said the Frogstar battle machine, after another moment's   consideration, "you must have one of those new Xanthic Re-Structron   Destabilized Zenon Emitters!"    "Nice, aren't they?" said Marvin.    "That's what you've got?" said the machine in considerable awe.    "No," said Marvin.    "Oh," said the machine, disappointed, "then it must be..."    "You're thinking along the wrong lines," said Marvin, "You're failing   to take into account something fairly basic in the relationship   between men and robots."    "Er, I know," said the battle machine, "is it..." it tailed off into   thought again.    "Just think," urged Marvin, "they left me, an ordinary, menial robot,   to stop you, a gigantic heavy-duty battle machine, whilst they ran off   to save themselves. What do you think they would leave me with?"    "Oooh, er," muttered the machine in alarm, "something pretty   damn devastating I should expect."    "Expect!" said Marvin, "oh yes, expect. I'll tell you what they gave   me to protect myself with shall I."    "Yes, alright," said the battle machine, bracing itself.    "Nothing," said Marvin.    There was a dangerous pause.    "Nothing?" roared the battle machine.    "Nothing at all," intoned Marvin dismally, "not an electronic   sausage."    The machine heaved about with fury.    "Well, doesn't that just take the biscuit!" it roared, "Nothing, eh?   Just don't think, do they?"    "And me," said Marvin in a soft low voice, "with this terrible pain in   all the diodes down my left side."    "Makes you spit, doesn't it?"    "Yes," agreed Marvin with feeling.    "Hell that makes me angry," bellowed the machine, "think I'll   smash that wall down!"    The electron ram stabbed out another searing blaze of light and   took out the wall next to the machine.    "How do you think I feel?" said Marvin bitterly.    "Just ran off and left you, did they?" the machine thundered.    "Yes," said Marvin.    "I think I'll shoot down their bloody ceiling as well!" raged the tank.    It took out the ceiling of the bridge.    "That's very impressive," murmured Marvin.    "You ain't seeing nothing yet," promised the machine, "I can take   out this floor too, no trouble!"    It took out the floor, too.    "Hell's bells!" the machine roared as it plummeted fifteen storeys   and smashed itself to bits on the ground below.
She is a lifelong Israeli. They are brought up believing they are the righteous people. People like Seth, who are brought up "normal jew," are not bombarded from birth to love and support what atrocities Isreal has dealt to the people who were there first. It is their "Devine right " no matter who they harm or kill.9
Probably some part are inside Gaza city, Israel is surrounding this city, probably Hamas want a urban fight
Back in the day I always wondered what the deal was with those goofy helmets worn by the counter terrorists on Dust 2 in CS
Good luck dudes I hope you wipe the bastard Hamas off the face of the earth
Who's the leader of the bunch that favors you and me?
Pay attention better then
Otherwise you get Gaza

I was telling my Mrs about this the other day. Could not believe it.
Lets show my 30M$ helicopter with worse camera than a 1000$ drone. Yeah i know this is degraded but it is still ridiculous.
You Jews can jog on you got dropped off in  Palestinian in 1946  took there land split there country up and you've got the prick " why it's not your land " I think uncle  Hitler should of done more for us all and that's coming from the UK üè¥Û†ÅßÛ†Å¢Û†Å•Û†ÅÆÛ†ÅßÛ†Åø
Oh, got it. Well it was quite the standard in the IDF back it the day but there are other more modern optics in use as well. I think because of the overall scale of the current force, everyone is taking what's available.
Literally sounding like the people of nazi Germany when Hitler was rising to power. You don't know what is happening on the power side of the street? Then you are just as complacent and you have just as much blood on your hands.

No
Problem?
Send theses cunts back
That was already a given. These people didn't all of a sudden begin to hate Jews as of 3 weeks ago. It's just it has become socially acceptable now under the guise of being "anti-Zionist". A lot of people can now express their disdain in a socially acceptable manner free of consequences. A lot of the Islamist world has preached hate towards Jews for a long time now and most of their population is already indoctrinated in hateful ideology.
I feel you. I've muted many people on Instagram and been told by extremally close friends I'm being an unsupportive ally.

Performative, melodramatic and an insult to victims of the Holocaust
You're indiscriminately grouping all the people of Israel with the current government / military administrations who yes are essentially committing war crimes. It's no different than grouping all Palestinians with Hamas which carried out terrorist attacks. Neither are correct characterizations. Be better.
Are you saying israelis aren't to blame for the action of the israeli government? Are you denouncing bds?
So where're the killed civilians?
I mean it‚Äôs an unresolved conflict going on since a few decades. I don‚Äôt think anyone was ever expecting Israel to never enter Gaza again. Was just a matter of time so more of history continuing than repeating tbh
What a surprise, more disappointment with US foreign policy.
You are lying
&gt;Now, the main problem is that it is assumed that hostages are kept in the same tunnels and doing that will either directly kill them or cause them to be executed by Hamas, as a kind of punishment or claim that Israel is killing their own hostages (of which a lot are international citizens)I think that they already decided that they aren't going to hold back unless they think they can retrieve hostages with relatively minimal damage
FBI has like 10 of their top 25 global terrorists as residing in Gaza, or affiliated with Hamas. Anyone keeping track of how many of these have been eliminated since oct. 10?
Jesus take the wheel my goodness this is batshit crazy they celebrating the hurt of innocent civilians woman children and babies
Do you mean the hospital Israel said they bombed? Only to pull that same statement when the civilian count made them look like monsters?
i think they all live on a tropical island disconnected from the rest of society
Literally 1984
&gt;Me: can we get equality and freedom?&gt;mom: No, we have that at home&gt;freedom and equality at home, **see above**.An angry mob is literally looking for arabs to lynch, meanwhile the police allowed this to continue, the university kicked the arabs out next day and the mayor released a statement basically supporting the mob and also agreeing with kicking the arabs, because "it's a Jewish college" and a jewish city.The allegations? *some* arab **allegedly** threw eggs and played loud music on the sabbath, I say allegedly because this police did not confirm this, but even if it did, angry mob chanting death to jews wouldn't be acceptable anywhere.
I don't think dilution is the answer, it just would spread it.Thanks for the sympathy, tho'.
it's also the quickest way to be condemned by the entire international community.
I've seen Israelis make noise while they live outside of Israel.  The Israeli press can and is censored by the military for "security purposes".  Including subjects that could be considered "controversial".  So it is hard to find a real dissenting voice from within Israel.
Mossad will take care of them.
And an Australian calling out racism. Good on him.
Even then, making about yourself the plight of your people 3 generations above, is a very tricky argument to pull, even more so when so much work has been done to right the wrongs of that era.
Honestly. How the hell does Hamas or any terrorist organization think they can take on a modern military might like this? They are FUCKED.
Safety of being shot you mean.
youd be surprised actually.
Protesting feels especially useless when the opposing side has jets, rockets, and long range missiles.
Did she just call every protestor against genocidal Israeli Zionism Anti Semitic?
I know I saw one clip of them using a drone to blow up a tank right?
uh yeah...they have been hanging themselves
 I get the joke, but I still downvoted because redditors are stupid and will believe this.
I read the other day that even the Merkava is explicitly designed for the warfare in Israel settings. Apparently they have a heavy focus on urban rather than tank combat and there's no requirement for the tank to cross rivers, for instance.
This if the first video I have seen of IDF soldiers in Gaza actually using Tavor bullpups. Most everyone seems to be using a M4 in other videos.

But hamas isn't Palestinians. That's the difference. Israel is Israel saying Palestinians are garbage, because Hamas is in control.
nah... israel did this to themselves. they treated gaza like a prison. and ended up with a prison gang ( hamas ) and a prison riot.  israel is clear cutting gaza they are bombing hospitals , with american made weapons.
i guess you could always go start a terror org in the middle east, they're constantly pumped with money from governments. You just may not last too long
This is true. Source: I have driven past Cheyenne Mountain over 10 times.
Israel targeted a hospital, and as proof here are some unrelated events in Prague or Warsaw or smth
My view towards Israelis has turned 180¬∞. What a bunch of entitled cunts.
As I said I won‚Äôt be voting for Joe Biden this election with the memory of those Palestinian kid‚Äôs broken bodies I got kids also I would die if that happens to them
Who are they addressing? AFAIK pretty much everyone has already condemned the actions of Hamas and demanded the release of the hostages.The yellow stars are not only too much, they are an insult to the survivors. Those well fed Israelis with their boots on the Palestinian neck have nothing in common with those who suffered the Holocaust.
Hey mr. Bo, I suggest you reevaluate the usage of barbarianism when your country‚Äôs coasties are playing the ‚Äúfucking around‚Äù card over not-your-fucking waters. Like I‚Äôm sad to hear that the peenoise coasties and navalrys made bad calls, I‚Äôm willing to scrutinize ‚Äòem, but don‚Äôt you dare use those moments as evidence to call us peenoises as barbarians, I‚Äôm pretty sure fishing vessels are different from navalry hand-me-downs.Anyways, back to NCD brain: COME ON FUCK AROUND JUST A BIT MORE, THE BUTTON‚ÄôS BEEN LOOKING SO TEMPTED!
And Mosul in 2017.
Isreal doing the same shit
Actually, since they released some hostages alredy, they are alredy dealing with the tunnels and its going "well", as far it is possible to know. How, where and when? No one outside IDF knows.
Am I clear to be an integral member of this fine established club? I've been here since my birthday in February 2022.

What‚Äôs funny is that the Western media has been running a 24/7 gaslighting campaign these past few weeks to flip the script, trying to somehow imply that tiny, poverty-stricken Gaza is analogous to Russia and that Israel the heavily armed colonial power is somehow Ukraine.
I love seeing them working. I am an operator for the army and haven't done anything with them except build tank defilades and Bradley fighting positions at training events along with the occasional tank ditch.
Probably depends in who is the target. Sometimes they flatten an entire neighbourhood and those videoing show specific buildings being destroyed.
You are Year 2001 levels of ignorant.You'd think all of the foreign doctors, media, and other foreign workers in Gaza would report on the crap you're spewing.Spoiler: They don't, and adamantly deny it when the questions are posed.
&gt;Plus Israel has deployed 300k soldiers, that's a lot of stuff to transport on a limited number of vehicles and there would be a potential for traffic jams in such a small areaImportant note: It's likely that a majority of the soldiers are positioned along the Lebanon border, where the more skilled militants are found.
Israel is the Karen of world politics.

Yeah Hamas isn't going to make it easy and that will do as much as possible to maximize civilian deaths on both sides. Their strategy relies on breaking the resolve on the international community by spreading around as much death as possible. From their point of view their ability to be indifferent, and celebrate death is a strength and that the international community values life is a weakness to be exploited.
Maybe. Maybe not ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è As I said, I haven‚Äôt seen any indication. Whichever it is, they remain silent while the rampage  continues.
Literally everything Hamas says has an agenda. Just like everything the IDF says also has an agenda. People need to stop using the combatants as the single source of truth for their claims.Edit: fuck, well played.

Brazil has been offered visa free traffic by several U.S. presidents if overstays stay at four percent. Sometimes swallowing hard and take the money is the best business practice.
I don't cheer for anyones dead kids, why should I?The Modus operandi is different, Hamas targets civilians, they shot the kids first hand as a primary target.Hamas has its stockpile and troops inside and under civilian houses, which makes those houses a legitimate military target - that's solely Hamas choices and Israel targets those houses which leads to dilemma as it increases civilian casualties - however it plays in Hamas hands as the more dead civilians the better it is for the PR of Hamas.I don't like that ppl solely criticize Israel all the time without any accountability from Hamas.It's Hamas choices where to hide their soldiers and rocket and they choose a civilians area well knowing that it puts their own kids at risk, they don't care, it's their tactics - instead of criticizing this tactic everyone only blames Israel and that's just dumb, it gives Terrorits a free pass for their wrongdoing
Well it wouldn't be the first time Israel shows itself entirely incapable of looking after their own interests. What a mess they made of the hope and dreams of the zionists. Pretty much every Jew in the world feels unsafe now.
I‚Äôve seen a lot of it on Reddit, source anecdotal
Moderators made this rule explicitly to support Hamas, this is not satire
When RU started installing cope cages at the early stages of invasion, many UKR supporters (in this subreddit as well) laughed and made fun of them. Now even IDF is adopting it so I guess it works to a certain extent.
My source? Bro, divine intuition.
The US sent a Special Forces team into Afghanistan by October 19 and that team, ODA 595, helped the locals defeat the Taliban in ~3 weeks.  The conventional troops were then sent in and we screwed it all up, but the first (and successful) phases of the war ended quickly. The initial battles were *ending* 2 months after 9/11, not just getting started.  The Taliban was out of power by about November 14 when both Kabul and Jalalabad fell.

According to netanyahu Hamas sank the titanic and killed harambe
Yep, history is distorted in every country. It's all smoke and mirrors.
Because an Israeli city is 20km away. That‚Äôs reason number one.Because if you drop a nuke on an underground complex with a city of 2 million Hamas slaves on top, the Hamas will live, their Palestinian slaves will die, and they will get exactly what they wanted. That‚Äôs reason number two.
And civilian human shields
Lots of people not getting the joke I see
If it's ancient and in modern Turkey it ain't Turkish.
Having been in a tank regiment, I can say that what we are seeing is them "stepping off." Once they near their objectives they will have spread out. Also, spreading out too much can actually weaken your advance as the enemy gets to deal with one tank at a time instead of a mass. Plus, Israelis know tanks.
So, to try and understand you, your argument is Israel couldn't avoid killing these children? That's honestly the line of reasoning you're going with?Nukes were dropped in WWII to hopefully avoid a land invasion, which would have resulted in millions of deaths. You can't think that Israel had to drop bombs on Gaza to avoid a land invasion. Your comparison seems like propaganda meant to assuage your guilt about supporting Israel killing innocent little kids.
No, Israel is attacking to eliminate Hamas not to take gaza as putin want taking ukraine gas and territory. Hamas messed with a vasp, what people expect? Honey?  Gaza will be free from Hamas soon, as ISIS was destroyed they will soon.
Hell yeah!

How can these people be semites and still be the most antisemitic pieces of work I've seen online all week. This is just disgusting.
They really do make themselves the victims
I guess that makes a lot of American Jews anti-Semitic, then.
The Holocaust was disgusting.  What happened Oct 7 was horrific.  But it is Israel's lies and controlling of the narrative that allows them to oppress and kill Palestinians with no blow back which of course is what led to Oct 7.  I wish people would demand truth from Israel and gage it's credibility based on its myriad of past events in which they lied about interactions with Palestinians only to later be found out as liars.  Then people would rightfully question what Israel says in events like the blowing up of the hospital.  I am sure that in two months it will be proven that they killed over 500 people **in a hospital** because they can and know their lies will gain traction because they always do
This trend of beating a persons head when they‚Äôre unconscious is disgusting and cowardly. I hope they begin to charge for attempted murder.
From those I've spoken too, the grunts won't wear them because they look 'Stupid' no joke. I don't think the IDF cares about looking stupid as long as they come home alive.
Cynically politicizing the memory of the millions that were murdered in the holocaust?Are these the depths that this hard right wing government has descended to?FFS...
Maybe you should read the whole comment.
The most ethical genocide.
Yes, I think the deaths of innocent children in Gaza are comparable to the deaths of innocent children in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Both are awful, but unavoidable.
 No, not "oh well" the answer is vote in the upcoming Democratic Primary and get Joe Biden off the line.  People are running against Joe Biden on the Democratic side.  Just because the media doesn't talk about it doesn't mean it isn't happening.  The polls show that Trump will probably be the Republican nominee and right now they show Biden losing the rematch.  If the Democratic Party was smart they would cut their losses and find someone else.  Preferably not another Corporate Democrat that panders to the working man while selling them down the river to their corporate donors.The lesson is the elections with the lowest turnout in the US, primaries are the absolute most important ones we have and they are mostly ignored. There can't be the Biden/Trump rematch that no one wants if they are not the nominees from their Parties.  IMHO the nation would be better off if both men pass away peacefully in the sleep before election season really gets started.
Losers!

Obviously this family knew the occupants of that house would be the subject of Israels attention.
You think the deaths of innocent children in Gaza is comparable to the end of WWII? Talk about a false equivalency!

No, it wasn‚Äôt stolen. It was pre-ordained years and years ago.
If the Zionist treatment of Palestinians is fair, America should treat its Zionists in the exact same fashion, no better, no worse.That would be fair? Right?
Can‚Äôt argue with that !

Ahh we've come full circle. That zion agenda put in full spotlight. I kinda remember another group of people that thought a certain land was their God given property. They killed a lot of people to get it as well. They also hid it from the world while their people had smiles on their face. I digress. These people are disgusting. I couldn't care less if isreal neighbors want to destroy it. Can't say I blame them. Tired of American taxes being WASTED helping them. Help yourselves. You made your bed now you can lie in it.
Not their first rodeo with him.

&gt; because they'd rather not know. It's easier on their conscience that way.That's how the world let the Holocaust happen. And that's how the world is letting ethnic cleansing happen.

Let it be known, I'd happily take New Zealand in as a state (but only if we got to get rid of New South Wales, I'd happily wage war on them)
&gt; But it's highly fucking likely.Based on what? It's completely unsubstantiated conclusion. Can you find any video evidence since insrael themselves claimed they will stop the practice that shows roof knocking?
Otherwise you get Fallujah2.0
Yes there is. Before I joined NCD, I was a normal dude. Now after joining yall, I have became a rather powerful psyker, and got pulled back into military service. Beware, for we are too powerful to be left to our own devices.

They have banned misinformation‚Ä¶ but not disinformation!
Those are the saddest sounding Allah Akbars I've ever heard.

Every single adult in Israel is complicit in what's happening to the Palestinian people and they know exactly what's happening. If they "don't know" it's because they'd rather not know. It's easier on their conscience that way. [Video](https://youtu.be/TJVOs4ALzj0?si=Zy0ylMMayUY-jSCC) showing the consciousness of Israeli people.
History keeps repeating itself
It‚Äôs a necessary evil. It‚Äôs not Israel‚Äôs fault. It‚Äôs the fault of Hamas and their use of meat shields.  Nuking Hiroshima and Nagasaki was also horrible. But it saved millions of lives. Just a little bit of context.
They are still notifying people in the West Bank where this is. This isn't Gaza.But they stopped with the warnings and roof knocks in Gaza. The Israli Defense Minister even stated so over a week ago. That they were moving on to the next phase of the campaign and there would be no more warnings for Gaza.The fact people deny the very words of the Israeli government when talking about this campaign is absolutely insane. It is literally a circle jerk where you're all just assuming stuff that even the Israelis are not talking about or doing themselves.But we saw this plenty during the Ukraine war. Everybody making the most fantastical assumptions about what Ukraine was going to do. Just to be proven wrong over and over again
Bunch of banchod guys
Don‚Äôt give these bots the time of day. Everyone in the west is waking up to Israel being run by tyrannical leaders pushing heavy extremism. So now Mossad has to send out the bots.

Right, and when they've eliminated hamas from the north of Gaza and destroyed all the homes, they'll do the same thing with the rest of the strip and leave the civilians they haven't killed with nothing. If they haven't taken the land for themselves of course
You bunch up in the assembly area and in a breach.  There are times you want to keep all the rigs tight, just not most of the time.  Even in a high intensity fight like Ukraine, you assume a breach will get hit eventually, so you push as many rigs through as you can, as fast as you can with the understanding that someone will take some artillery.  Welcome to the infantry!It will be interesting to see how the stat armor will behave in an urban environment vs RPGs though.
I honestly think that unless they know for 100% the location of hostages and that they are alive, Israel has already decided that they are gone and this is a vengeance operation. Right now I‚Äôd wager their priority concerning the tunnels is to do their angel hair thing to find entrances, ensure that they can conclusively collapse all tunnels out of Gaza, or at least sponge-bomb them, and ensure that the FOB they are inevitably going to establish is secure from surprise attack. If Israel decides that the remaining hostages are nearly certainly dead, I wouldn‚Äôt be suprised to see them flooding tunnels, I know they‚Äôve been known to flood them with sewage before
If I were president I'd give a big speech about how it is sad that these conflicts are still ongoing, even escalating. How sad the loss of life is, etc.Then, I'd block all funding to Israel. Why don't we use those $10s of billions to feed hungry kids instead of a dictator against universal human rights? Perhaps Israel will get a moral democracy and we can provide aid, but in the meantime, you dug your own grave, now sleep in it.
Not after reddit purged all the hamas videos no
Common Palestinian L
He works for Shin Bet, of course he will say whatever he can to keep his job and his better quality of life in the USA.That being said, some of the stuff he said is valid. For example, the torturing of civilians by Hamas has been written about before by others. But the important thing to point out is that Palestinians are the victim there, and they're the victim now. Caring for them, sending aid, and ensuring they aren't needlessly killed is important, they have had it **rough** for the past 80 or so years thanks to Israel. We need to acknowledge that and help them.
Tunnels on the third floor of a cancer hospital. Classic hamas.Edit: never skip  /s. I don't want someone on worldnews bringing them up like they're real.

OH well maybe the terrorist go there and hide them selves..
They do this every single time. 1967 onward gets real interesting. Israel has been ignoring the UN for 60 years. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Nations_resolutions_concerning_Israel
Imagine wanting civilians not to be killed and somehow that makes you the bad guy. We live in a crazy world.
Go get um boys
there are construction engineers in Israel who built infrastructure in Gaza and are aware of the geological weak spots. They claim that since the tunnels are 30m deep from what is already nearly sea level, the tunnels can be flooded.  Supposedly, this was known and avoided by Israel, who were looking to avoid escalation, either for simply trying to better the relationship with Gaza or to strengthen Hamas as an opposition to the leading PLA authority (depending who you believe).  I think an attack on the tunnels is very viable. We already know that the tunnels rely on active ventilation and I guess one attack could be to shut down ventilation and then blow in Carbon Monoxide with jet engine (like how natural gas is transported in pipes).  Now, the main problem is that it is assumed that hostages are kept in the same tunnels and doing that will either directly kill them or cause them to be executed by Hamas, as a kind of punishment or claim that Israel is killing their own hostages (of which a lot are international citizens)
UN says, quoting reliable HamasSources that 7,845 Palestinian civilians have been killed so far, including 10,453 children.
They are sleeping in Iran currently.
One might say entirely disrespectful to Holocaust victims and survivors.
I agree üíØ immigration has to change to set immigrants up for success. AND to not lose sight of helping the Canadians that were born here.I also agree üíØ that PMJT has let in way too many international students as well as immigrants and asylum seekers.This is causing dissatisfaction with newcomers and the Canadian citizens that already live here are frustrated and don't want anything to do with the immigrants. It's too much of a clash and lack of any smooth transition.
Just a bunch of Romulans who are still butthurt over the loss of their homeworld.
God speed and God bless IDF
Supposedly they have a ridiculous and fairly advanced tunnel system . seen some photos and vid , some of their underground strongholds are (supposedly) built under the big hospital in gaza and other large civilian buildings that they know wouldn‚Äôt be targeted . Kind of a greasy tactic
How do you bomb a hospital in self defense?
Any links to the tunnels?
I wish Bernie was running. Ik he doesn‚Äôt have a lot of support in the US but he‚Äôs on the right side of this conflict. Free Palestine

Have you ever looked through one? It‚Äôs like a video game. Very convoluted design and are much better options for a professional military IMO
Several months ago loud mouths were upset Israel wasn't sending their military equipment to Ukraine. I guess this is why they were reluctant.
I'm sure there are countries in the west that will do something akin to the Marshall Plan.  But, as long as Hamas is governing, I'm equally certain that many countries will give very little out of concern that the aid will be used by Hamas to rebuild their war fighting capabilities.The catch being that any Palestinian governing body other than Hamas will be seen as a puppet of the Israelis for having gained power in the aftermath of this war.The whole thing is fucked almost beyond hope at this point and plenty more innocent people will die before this war is over.
That's the parallel I make too. Vocal anti-zionist is not what I could have ever imagined on a 2023 bingo card. Israel has gone off the deep end for sure this time and I'm done with them as much as I am done with Russia.
Send in Gump with a flashlight and 1911
Zionist Israelis, not Jews.
Maybe Hamas can disrupt logistics by popping up out of hidden tunnels after the Israeli front line has passed by.Plus Israel has deployed 300k soldiers, that's a lot of stuff to transport on a limited number of vehicles and there would be a potential for traffic jams in such a small area
Same here. Watching this makes me seriously sick to my stomach. Israel may say they're the Jewish state but those people do not fucking speak for me
Lol you must be stupid to think he's smart
Yep, it's been one of the central talking points in their bot army.One of the tactics is to just write a paragraph and arbitrarily swap when they use Hamas/Palestine.
How many bombs so far ? Why not 1 nuke ?
&gt;dead children as collateral is okThat's your monstrous take. Lots of little kids have been killed by Israeli bombs. There's no way to pretend that's ok.
Yes if they were fighting an actual army it will be different
aint no leaving the gaza strip
I like how I shut you down, and you had to comb through my posts to conclude that my life is pathetic, I can do that too, you know. For example, at least I'm not on reddit looking for friends.
technically there are no civilians above 18 years old in israel, they are all armed settlers gangs.
Very possible! Or they had an emergency can of it in the basement.
Also Israel has great air defenses.
They surely have some ATGMs. Doesn‚Äôt matter though
I was about to say, bots aren‚Äôt the only ones that do that. Not just with this issue either. Any major contentious thing at all, you see people just lie and double down when obviously and objectively proven wrong about specific facts. It‚Äôs about picking a side and never budging even when it‚Äôs a detriment to the side you picked.
I didn't think anybody answers those calls
its like a godlike sledgehammer just strikes the building once and its done it does even sound like a big hammer hitting it
This is terrible. I think the only reason he seems so calm is that he fully expects to be killed as well, and truly believes he will be reunited with his family in death.
Israel is no better than Nazi Germany at this point. FTFY
And they say there are no third places anymore.  üòÇ
Keep up with the good work!!

Such a horrible take from Biden...
Why It's crazy? Asking to understand
That is not untrue.  I had a Mexican drug dealer pull a gun on me  in parking lot because his chick driving him parked like an ass hole and I honked at them to move. I pulled my gun and we had guns at each other. Intense is an understatement.  I carry so it was a very intense situation just because they thought they could do whatever the fuck they want.  I DONT WANT them in my country - Is that effing OK?   If you have never experienced this you can fuck the right hell off.  Pussies like you have no idea.  Have you ever even heard a bullet over your head?   What are you like 12?  KMA  BTW the louder the crack the close the bullet is.  The bullet you don't hear is the one that killed you.  When they pass so close you get hearing damage (I have it) you know you were in some shit.  Once you hear enough of the cracks you can tell what type.  - you tell me how to tell the difference of a bullet crack.  - BTW you hear the crack before the shot.
I don't know how to fly a 747 but I can tell when someone is doing it wrong...
Have you even read just some of it? All the facts are substantiated. Yes Hamas is some limb dicks. But that does not mean that you should cheer for bombing children and civilians. But nono. Israel is saying that 5 year old is a terrorist.
They didn't have coherent goals. That would necessitate ascribing more agency to them than is due. People love to retro-analyze events in light of consequences and assume all the consequences were predicted. That's never the case.I've read many theories about the intentions of Hamas in the Oct 7th attack. They're probably all true, relative to certain people within Hamas. But that also means that there are many in Hamas whose goals were not and will not be reached.
China locks its own Muslim population in prison.  What Muslim immigrant would travel to China just to be locked up for "re-education".  Something the Chinese understand immensely...if you have nothing, you always have religion.  The cult of communism is no different.  Have no other God than the communist party.
Looks like a video game.  Reality looks like a video game.

Biden absolutely lost the 2024 election. He didn‚Äôt win by a landslide in 2020. It was a tooth and nails battle by the people to get rid of trump  and even with that he barely scrapped by in the big battle ground states. With the current economy, his age and mental capacity, coke in the white house, Hunter Biden getting a plea deal that a black kid could only dream off, and finally supporting genocide with billions of dollars. I personally campaigned for Biden and it is a regret that I will live with. I would absolutely not vote for him next time. If it is trump vs Biden, I am voting for an independent

This feels like the view of one side
how could you forget the rocks!?
You'd have thought they might have had that on 6th October. I keep hearing about HAMAS tunnels big enough to drive a SUV through yet only ever see person wide tunnels
There's no shame in Sharia law* .There, I corrected this for you.
Endless cycle of violence.
Lots of warning because cameras just happen to be recording specific buildings.
Especially when the Clean up teams arrive in Katar to get all them that escaped.
There are three sides.   Hamas.  The Israeli government.  And the people who just want their kids to grow up safe.   I side with the last side.  As does anyone else who says they don't pick a side.  Your perspective is binary and basic.  THAT is weak shit, honestly.
Genuine question, what do you think Israel should‚Äôve done after 1400 people were slaughtered on their own turf? Sit back and accept it?  Israel is not committing genocide. They are bombing and shelling militant positions. These positions are shielded by civilians. What is Israel to do? They don‚Äôt have a choice. They are doing everything they can to avoid civilian casualties, by warning civilians before they bomb. But there‚Äôs only so much they can do.
Ramalla is not in gaza its in the west bank and the idf can go inside there with no problems when it needs to
Can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm seeing Meprolight optics used in actual combat. Crazy.
Goodluck to the IDF
Sure, since you asked. I'd say you'd have to put in the legwork similar to what we had to do in the middle east as opposed to flattening entire cities. You have to go in, "build rapport", and figure out who and where the bad guys are. Yes it's a pain in the ass and entirely dangerous, that's "the cost of waging war"Now please share your thoughts on why Israel is special and doesn't have to do the same, and explain how indiscriminate civilian bombing is actually morally correct this time
It‚Äôs in Canada, province of Ontario, it‚Äôs a city on the outskirts of Toronto, nord west of Toronto to be precise.
All the sudden that peaceful act of protesting the occupiers (machine gunning down a bunch of women and children at a concert) is probably looking like a bad move to Hamas
The solution is occupation and eventually annexation of Gaza. Israel never wanted it but now they will have to rule it for their own security.
There own falures..... you are aware of the situation in Gaza strip?
Just your average "Freedom" fighters.....
"They're bringing drugs, they're rapists, and some I assume are good people". by the way is randomly grabbing pussies a part of "family values" now? Man you guys are jokesters.
Its not an airstrike its a demolition from the ground
Isn't Israel a police state? Where was the IDF that day, even more so given it is a town next to Gaza strip? Day by day it looks like this was known, and Bibi used it as an excuse to do his "biblical" shit in that region.
China will soon get also some massive ageing population problems
Having a word for something does not make right or wrong. Happy that we don't have concentration Camps in Europe anymore though...

Yes, Kiwiland and Emutopia are not at war, and have never been at war.Any who say otherwise are traitors to the glorious Emu Empire!
Every time you do this hamas we will kill 1000 for every one of us....... to the people of Palestine get rid of these suicidal jihadi rapists.
I'm guessing they're sick of dealing with the Gazans and all their BS from the last 25 years. Don't blame them either.

You are 100% correct, I will edit.  Thank you!  Wondering if it was his name that made me think Iraq, idk, but i was incorrect!
It a one sided list - so what's that to proof? Congratulations for nothing.It's not even mentioning that the Arab states attacked Israel after the decliof independence.It also leaves out the fact that Arab ppl did get most if the land and it went to syra and Jordan - I mean seriously, the Arabs did get the majority of the land, and yet they whine that Israel "got it all" - simple math could help....It's lacking major historic events, up to the time of the Roman empire etc....
Yea can't blame them, if I was one of them I would be living every day as if it is my last, odds are it is.

They were always a piece Iran was willing to sacrifice. They knew what reaction thier actions on the 7th would illicit. The Leaders in Qatar aren't being effected. Maybe lose some beachfront property they bought with UNAID money.
Unfortunately all they will remember is that their brother/sister/parent/uncle died from a massive Jewish invasion.While Israel‚Äôs path here is justified, it will not change the trajectory of this 70+ year conflict in any way. If they somehow eradicate Hamas, someone else will fill the void.We‚Äôve seen this before, and we will see it again.
A Marshall plan kinda requires the other side to recognize their errors and accept defeat in the first place, does it not? Otherwise you get‚Ä¶ Afghanistan. Or some better analogy where the local population is not willing to accept the assistance
Especially with their stance on this Israel/Palestine conflict.
&gt;Aren't they, according to their logic, unable to loose? If they fight and die, paradise. If they fight and live, victory...So, death and paradise for them? Everybody wins then.
Disgusting and a betrayal of humanity
OK, so I'm going to say something that is very unique to the Internet in general, and social media in particular, I hope I don't get downvoted to oblivion.  I don't know enough about the engineering of tunnels to form an informed opinion :)
Why not? It is in the best interest of Israel. When Nazi Germany was defeated they got billions of economic aid because the Allies understood that extremism would rise again if the Germans were left to live in squalor.
That feigning ignorance was giving heavy vibes of when the 82nd and 101st Airborne liberated Wobb√´lin and Kaufering IV respectively. They then confronted German civilians about it, and forced them to bury the dead.

Are you sure it wasn't the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem? That is the usual talking point. It's a little complex because it's true he was an ally of Hitler's and declared they were united against the Jewish enemy. It's probably not true that he had anything to do with starting the Holocaust. His hatred and that of other Palestinians was rooted in resentment of Jewish immigrants to Palestine following WW1 because they were buying up lots of land and pushing Muslim/Christian locals out of many areas.
Even if all Hamas fighters were killed or captured in the assault on Gaza in the weeks to come, Hamas leadership and their sugar daddies are well away from Gaza.So, if those people wish to rebuild their forces and go at it again, they will. It should be pretty easy for them to recruit new members among the survivors.Still, flushing Hamas from Gaza and preventing them from using it as a base is going to weaken them and hurt their ability to attack Israel for a while.
Came here to say this. Absolutely disgusting and inappropriate. The last thing any Jewish person should want is for the current situation to be associated in any way with the decimation of more than 6 million innocent people. Shame on him.
Kaiser Soze style?
Well make a list from the other perspective
Let's be fair, who would not rather enjoy a good time with Champaign and hookers compared how their subjects and foot soldiers live and die now.
No point to worry about the vest and helmet from Wish/Aliexpress, the delivery would take too long.
That is a lot of Find Out.
Kind of? When the initial conflict was incited by the Zionist decades ago? You said what.. both ways?And which people in Gaza? You refer to all of them as in general civilian, or those involved with Hamas raid?I know Hamas militants did that, but never heard non-combative Gaza civilian did any of that.I admit it. That is really a convenient way to slather blood on innocent civilian by referring them as "People in Gaza".Don't act like a pacifist will ya. It's too obvious.
Strike the Earth!
Not door knocking... This was a controlled demolition from inside the house - not even an airstrike.
Both are. BUT if you base that answer on civilian casualties alone....... We all know who is the most terrorist.
I feel the same as you and have been completely disgusted by the Biden admin.
Because it was a controlled demolition that's been planned for about a week, not an airstrike. This is in the West Bank, not Gaza. [https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-demolishes-west-bank-home-of-exiled-senior-hamas-official-saleh-al-arouri/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-demolishes-west-bank-home-of-exiled-senior-hamas-official-saleh-al-arouri/)
I guess something like the marshall plan, but I dont think it will be funded by Israel.
I would have never Imagine her advocating for such a thing...
Technically it was an unsafe house.
That's exactly what they did, actually.[https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-demolishes-west-bank-home-of-exiled-senior-hamas-official-saleh-al-arouri/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-demolishes-west-bank-home-of-exiled-senior-hamas-official-saleh-al-arouri/)

One thing for sure, it's not about racism is religion
It's because this was a controlled explosion from inside the house, not an airstrike.[https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-demolishes-west-bank-home-of-exiled-senior-hamas-official-saleh-al-arouri/](https://www.timesofisrael.com/idf-demolishes-west-bank-home-of-exiled-senior-hamas-official-saleh-al-arouri/)
Not buying that. They are too close to the ocean not to have water table issues that deep, especially in sandy soil.
Lol bullshit
The mods have discovered my ruse: my waifus will never come to lifefu
Looks like they properly destroyed the place. After this war, is there going to be a Marshall Plan for Gaza like they did for Nazi Germany or are they just going to leave the Palestinians to rot in their misery?
Oof! I wasn't aware he said that.
One of the first things Hamas did during the terrorist attack was blow up a Merkava with a drone grenade through the roof (the video of which was spammed here dozens of times). Not surprising they'd quickly take action against it.
They definitely aren't, at least the majority aren't,  there's videos of the tunnels and most are like 5 metres underground at most
I wasn‚Äôt aware the IDF had cope cages?
Oh so they *can* target individuals without leveling city blocks.
and all enemy have is rifles and pipe bombs. oh im sorry handgliders and motorcycles too
I dont know exact numbers, but I'd say about half the population in Israel is brown
We should‚Äôve called it ‚Äúslocism‚Äù. Then maybe it wouldn‚Äôt be spreading so fast
Hamas is identified with green. His militants often wear green headbands
And then [have to resign as a result,](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/10/21/business/web-summit-ceo-paddy-cosgrave-resigns/index.html)looking at Paddy Cosgrave founder and CEO of the Web Summit.
Won't work, Hamas would have installed airlocks and water traps to keep the IDF from gassing them out.  More likely the Israelis will use ground penetrating radar combined with explosives to cave the tunnels in.  That or they'll have to go in like Vietnam tunnel rats, but hopefully with drones doing the most dangerous work instead of soldiers.
Pretty sure most of the Israeli who voted against the current Prime Minister are not really happy about what he is doing.  The problem is Israel is already half a police state because of the occupation, it wouldn't take much to make it a full one.  With the Zionist currently drunk with power they would make the lives of any Israeli that publicly spoke of a peaceful solution uncomfortable at the very least.  Possibly killing them at worse, killing them could come with the added bonus of potentially blaming a Palestinian to generate even more hate.
This might be more biblically accurate in this context
Maybe 10 years ago, but not now. PMJT has let in way too many immigrants over his term without the proper resources to help them succeed in Canada. They have all been lied to that Canada is a safe, wealthy country with an abundance of jobs and housing. So in certain cities in the greater Toronto area, English speaking Canadians are the minority, therefore no real need to speak the minority language.
If you consider the amount of dead (8K according to Hamas), and the number of bombs dropped (probably 10K but I can't find a source except 6K in the first week), you can reason they're surgically striking.  And yes, every innocent person who died or got injured is a tragedy.
The targets are not civilians though. Israel needs to eradicate this terror body that is using the civilian population to hide, tragic but don't judge if you were lucky enough not to get invaded by terrorists please
No, definitely not everyone. Very very far from everyone
Extremely partisan and devoid of reasonable discussion is exactly the kind of comments this 5 sec clip will produce.
Probably better translated as "Out", but holy crap I am nitpicking here this was a great translation.
Also we are going in with the first wave. You smash the entire area, you kill anything moving, do you get me?
Holy geneva checklist!
Where the hell is Brampton?
I read that the tunnels are very deep underground (50 to 200 meters ), I don't know if that matters or not.
 Most of the power is prepared in the north of Israel , Gaza just seeing a fraction of the power of Israel

*Buddy*
*cue*
Resorting to ‚Äúhey remember the holocaust?‚Äù to justify actions that have nothing to do with it. They think they can play the victim card forever and get away with war crimes. What a fucking joke. Israel is really losing the narrative on this war.
We saw them in Syria and Iraq though, and the karabakh war involved a lot of drones.
I‚Äôve never seen a country play the victim so goddamn much while simultaneously committing genocide.
I mean if you're willing to drop buildings on hostages and children, you were never in mourning.
"Allah akbar :/"
This is insane. Never gonna down play what happened to them in the past or the recent attacks but framing this as if Palestinians are the nazis in this situation doesn‚Äôt even make sense. Like even the people that support them have to see how inappropriate this all is right?
This "no questions asked" aid needs to stop ASAP, it's getting ridiculous.
Yup.  When you have millions and millions of $$ at your disposal, anything is possible.
~~Probably not, but that would also only matter if we were dumb enough to number them sequentially.~~  Uhh, I mean, of course we don‚Äòt because there is no 8492nd squadron.
No don't worry ammo is precious at this time, we wouldn't use it. In the idf we have a saying- ever bullet has an address. Meaning every shot must count. .If they are shooting at something it's because they identified enemies beyond our view. We don't fire indiscriminately, we have hostages and civilians there.
And for the foreseeable future
Dehousing the population is the point
Exactly, even though during the ground operation they may flatten a building just to protect the troops advancing. However you can see from the footage that the north of the Strip has been largely evacuated.You‚Äôre being downvoted because many people ask these questions in bad faith and it‚Äôs difficult to distinguish. Fwiw i removed my downvote.
Trump wouldn't give the Palestinians any aid.  All another Trump Presidency would do would be to end democracy in the United States.
Carpet bombing hasn't been a thing since the Vietnam war, as far as I know. It's expensive, pointless and a war crime.
https://rationalwiki.org/wiki/The_Grayzone
Yes, Hamas is notorious for using civilian infrastructure. One of their headquarters is located underneath a hospital.
Do we even have 8492 squadrons in the entire air force?
How much of a fucking asshole you have to be to play the holocaust card this way ? Fuck theses people, they have no sense of decency or humanity in them.
You see no issue with setting up a religious ethno-state in a region already inhabited by millions of people?
It would have been a lot more visually effective if they came out already wearing them. The imagery of putting on your own persecution is so fucking lol. Cunts.
What makes it worse is it states that they're already in Southern Gaza, where everyone is being told will be safe. But is they're now being struck, where can they go? Northern Gaza is rubble and dust now.
You are basically a holocaust denier. I think antisemite is called for. Also tiktok isnt a credible source.
Making a mockery of the UN
Great to hear someone help make it make sense.
You're right. It's not undisputable evidence of a roof knock. But it's highly fucking likely.Compared with other videos - this is a less careful camera set up, the audio and visual quality is worse and looks handheld (probably a phone). Controlled demolition seems less likely considering the current situation. But even this exact example aside - we come back to /r/whyweretheyfilming all the other videos of airstrikes.As for the people claimed to be killed by the airstrikes. How the fuck is the IDF confirming that? But even if they are getting who they say they are, the IDF have also said they aren't roof knocking everything anymore - and considering the scale of destruction the IDF has wrought on Gaza versus the number of videos, it's quite likely many strikes haven't been filmed because there was no warning.
Indeed, very stupid questions.I believe that you tried to make a smart remark and then saw the backlash, and now you are trying to crawl your way out by pretending to ask a "genuine" question.
OK that makes sense so they aren't just carpet bombing a whole area they are selecting each building they have intel on.
Sadly it isnt.  Netanyahu earlier blamed the Grand Mufti of ~~Iraq~~ Jerusalem for the holocaust because the mufti allied with the Nazis.Edit: Grand Mufti of Jerusalem Haj Amin al-Husseini, not Iraq.  My mistake, and thank you to /u/Variety-Impressive
The guy talking is actually a journalist. He saw an old man driving women and children. He warned two other cars that managed to drive back. A bus didn't see his warning and got hit too. I don't have a link but there's a video of him on Twitter I believe.
Im not watching a holocaust denier from tictok. If you have any credible sources ill read them.
Oh no, they‚Äôre sooo oppressed.
No need to get annoyed I'm just asking questions
Helps that they use international aid meant for Palestinians to reinforce their tunnels (concrete, digging machines, etc).
It definitely gives off a ‚Äúremember we‚Äôre the victims of the past so we can‚Äôt be the villains of the future‚Äù vibe.
Figuratively 2023
What are you even talking about?
Race, ideology, money do that too.
Wow that's so antisemitic!, they are justifying the current ethnic cleansing and mass murder of children by hiding behind holocaust.
The vote also condemned the actions of Israel. Canada wanted to add language that condemned the actions of Hamas as well, but that addition did not get enough support to make it through. This is likely what is being referred to.

They are aiming for any location Hamas terrorists use. Hamas is a terrorist group that hides itself among civilians and is posing as civilians.

Me? I live in Sweden, not Israel. But i know enough history and studied enough archaeology to know that Israel existed as a nation in that land for many centuries. There is no "Palestinian" ethnic group, most are arabs by the way. Palestinians have a long history of terrorism, it's why none of the surrounding countries want any "refugees". As for Israel, its one of the most advanced nations on this planet, the only democracy in the ME and a country whose scientists win Nobel prizes very often. What do you do? Use aid money to build tunnels, buy missiles and terrorise civilians? What is your contribution to the world? Same goes for today's Iran (biggest sponsor of terrorism) and many other regional players.

Literally right out of the playbook
The occupation is the original sin. It all starts from there. Heck even the two state solution doesn't sit right with these people.
The question is how much of Hamas they can actually locate. Israeli policy has given Hamas 16 years of uncontested rule over Gaza, they control the borders and civilian populations. They have the means to escape first or blend in.In general, the most likely outcome is a whole bunch of destruction while Hamas will survive once again and continue to build on the sentiments of populations that haven't seen a serious peace proposal in their entire young lifes, and Israel will continue to have a terrorism volcano at its southern border that errupts every couple years to decades.
Will that's a new one.

Aren't they, according to their logic, unable to loose?If they fight and die, paradise. If they fight and live, victory...At least for the, in lack of a fitting term, "fighters"?If the higher-ups remain, they will rebuild. Don't get me wrong, I have strong feelings opposing religion in general and religious extremists in particular, and what began on the 7th is horrible and has to be punished.That said, the (obviously selective) footage from the idf also paints a grim picture, and the direction Israel is heading politically is somewhat unsettling. Starting with a nationalist government, imbalance in the democratic process due to the lack of a constitutional control instance and whatever is happening now.It just feels like there is a very volatile situation in a very unstable region, adding to the already bright burning inferno of ukr/ru, taiwan/China, global warming, economical collapse and the humanitarian crisis of hunger, disease, flight ans expulsion.Is there anywhere an independent source objectively explaining the whole situation since the beginning of the state israel so I can achieve a better understanding?Hm... that wen't from "but do they?" to "this is not fine" way too fast.
He left because Hamas was torturing prisoners for info that they thought were spies. That's screwed up for sure. But why join a side that does the same and who's biggest ally is a country who created those tactics of torture? This guy is a joke with less than two brain cells.

It will be interesting to see how drone warfare has evolved in this particular conflict.
I personally feel this stance is going to cost Biden a lot of votes in 2024. Personally, I'm pro-Palestine, yet I'm anti-Hamas as well. I also support the people of Israel, but I despise Netanyahu and the Israeli government's treatment of innocent Palestinian civilians.
Poor guys, they are slaughtering people wholesale and they're playing the pity card. Maybe somebody should remind them world war II was over almost 80 years ago, and that they too are capable of heinous things.

Cope cages were seen on Russian tanks relatively early in the war, and certainly before Ukraine started prolifically using suicide drones and drone-dropped bombs/grenades.

There is no good side in this war. Both are terrible.
A satellite estimate suggested that 10% of structures had damage. The percentage that are destroyed/unsalvageable is presumably substantially less. Still heavy damage, but 15% seems high.
&gt; Pretty much every video you see of the building before the strike - like this one - is evidence of a roof knock. Otherwise, /r/whyweretheyfilming ?That is not evidence. That's speculation. Evidence would be showing the actual roof knock. As to why were they filmig: this is unlikely an airstrike, you can't hear the bomb coming down which if you watch other videos has loud and distinctive sound. It was more likely demolished which makes "roof knocking" comments seem even more as automatic rehearsed response than any actual genuine conclusion from seeing the video.There is also a huge survivorship bias here, people might be filming all the time during airstrikes but if they point camera in the wrong direction they won't capture the explosion so won't post the video. The only videos you see posted is when they filmed the explosion.&gt; The target isn't the people (though I'm sure the IDF would be happy to knock out any Hamas peoples in the building, they can't risk too many civilian casualties) - it's the actual structure, any military stuff inside, and the organisational focal point that the structure enables.Every day IDF posts new airstrike videos with commentary saying who they killed in it, the target is definitely people.
Gloves are off but they are still fighting with one hand tied behind. The IDF still needs to worry about civilian casualties and hostages.If neither of these were a concern, I'm pretty sure they'd just carpet bomb the entire place, pump the tunnels full of water and wait around for months until Hamas runs out of supplies.
They are well trained. Are most of these guys not reservists though? They don't look like the hardened fighters we see in Ukranian videos.edit: accidental question mark.
No of course not. Im just thinking whats the point of a ground operation if Hamas is just gonna go into hiding? Are they just destroying tunnels, that are gonna immediately be rebuild or whats the objective here? Just for PR?
Limiting civilian casualties is what makes an urban war very costly. However that rules of engagement has already gone out the window. Israel will simply blast away buildings and any sort of defense and sanctuary the Hamas expects in an urban setting. Israel has learned its lesson of 2006.
Do we know that the Russian's introduced them to try and protect against top atack ATGMs and not quadcopters?
Sick sick sick.. not every one is terrorists in gaza most of the people in gaza is poor ppl just trying to make it.. the same thing happened to jews in Germany but this is what happens when history is not thought... humans are very disgusting and i do not side with israel or palistine.. this is not my country not my war.

Tbh I would be way more cautious, it is a urban ground invasion against at least 20.000 prepared fights which melt with the general population. It is an ideology which reproduces with every casualty and gets heavy support from outside forces. This will take years and isn‚Äòt guaranteed to be a full on success.

Throw a burning tire and seal the tunnel. Not my idea, saw it in a Reddit post on Iraq fighting ISIS in a tunnel.
Perhaps this is a good opportunity to look inward and do some research as to why you would support a country that is founded on racism, ethnic cleansing, genocide and apartheid in the first place. It is tough to shake years of the propaganda you‚Äôve been fed but if you open your eyes to it, you‚Äôll see that you should‚Äôve never rooted for Israel in the first place.

Pretty insensitive to the 1930s jews that actually suffered.
Has Israel and their settles considered not being land stealing fascists? Perhaps leave the west bank instead of encroaching on Palestinians, occupying them &amp; denying them their rights? Palestinians have every right to resist their occupiers, and will continue to do so. Free Palestine.
They were detected, but Gaza is Palestinian land, nothing Israel could do about Hamas doing exercises inside their own territory. Nobody expected a massive terror invasion bigger than 9/11. Porbbaly not even Hamas.
Yup, that was one of the reasons, though by far not the only one
True.
Saudia already condemned Hamas's attack and said negotiations will continue after the war is over. US ships all over the middle east reduce the likelihood of wider escalation. The people of Israel are united and the entire country is either enlisting or volunteering. Left, right, doesn't matter. Everyone knows Hamas has to be eradicated and are getting ready for a years long campaign, nothing like the short operations in the past but an actual war.I see your point but I seriously doubt they expected such a reaction.
Protesting Israel is not discrimination it's holding them to consistent ethical and moral standards no matter how inconvenient that might be.
Hamas are the scum of the earth but fuck these cunts for using the holocaust to justify their war crimes.

You really think Hamas can take on IDF in open field? lol
All to enable their already supported inflicting of suffering and war crimes on another group of people.
Right after they murdered their parents. Get fucked.
Doubtfull. They already reached their goals. Diplomatic progress stopped, international attention increased. Everything that happens now, to civilians in Gaza or IDF soldiers, is just "cost of doing business" for them. The grunts on the ground will get their virgins and the puppet masters in Qatar won't be affected.
I thought it was fake, since I couldn't find info on Google, but the fact that I had to Google it means that I may be spending too much time here.
I'll be shocked if there's one piece of enemy visible footage from this ground invasion. Israel√≠es are just walking around blowing shit up at this point.
Are you one of the people in the video, feigning ignorance?I like the "gotcha" questions you were trying to set up in this thread, though. I'm glad the people replying weren't ignorant enough to fall for them.You *should* be ashamed, but everyone knows there's no shame in Zionism.
How can he fight?
Those D9s are working overtime.
It‚Äôs not real, we joke about going to war with them all the time, but when push comes to shove, you better bet your ass we‚Äôre sticking up for our kiwi brothers and sisters
I don't see any of the links you say you have. Spewing this kind of propaganda is the mirror image of the people calling palestinians animals and sub humans.
How the fuck is the 2nd best funded military in the world with pretty much limitless resources so incompetent? IDF seems to be great at shooting at kids throwing stones but where are they now?!?!?
This is hiking footage.

I strongly recommend being on the side that gets to define what violence is. Very liberating!

But we have press statements from released hostages that the IDF gunned down other captives. We have videos of them bombing places they knew hostages were being held. They're happy to sacrifice Israeli lives if it means the extermination of Palestine.

That's a LOT of tanks and armour.It also says a lot about how poor Hamas' artillery and drone capabilities are if Israel has been able to just mass tanks so close together without any threat.
Not so safe anymore.

People like this don't even believe in their religion. It's like right wingers using the Bible as a club and a shield.
It won't be easy but if any army in the world can do it, it's the IDF. They are the best trained for urban warfare.
I‚Äôve commented in here on one of my other hobby dedicated account that is 6 years old and 100k+ karma and it still removed it so idk if that‚Äôs completely true‚Ä¶
Trust me they know... for a while now. They know they're the worst kind of fucked, **they know they're done.**Edit: so many interesting responses to my comment. Can't bring myself to reply to all of them, but in general I tend to agree with them all. Regardless, hope to see Hamas get buttfucked hard into their paradise, trust that land might only be lost for the Palestinians due to this incursion.
That's not exactly how it works.Since reservists can get called up anytime the units have more than 100% staffing built in, with the assumption that at any call up some will be unavailable due to being sick, going through medical procedures, being abroad on holiday or business and a number of other clauses. A lot of reservists boarded flights and returned from trips and even semesters abroad to show upThere is also an element of people who have missed a few call ups and have been struck down from the rooster or just aged out, but served in the reservist unit for a long time and did just show up.
Aren‚Äôt we contributing to mis information with our endless shit posting though, like where do you draw the line between shit posting Florks and legit mis information?
Of course the Hamas cameraman will say that it was an orphanage in the car.
For the first time in a long time the gloves are off and Israel is going in dry.
Attaboys
What a psycho. Should have been red in the first place. He deliberately went over the ball.
Reminder that when the attack on oct 7 happened, before the IDF mobilized a single troop, they began shelling Gaza, even while the hostages were being moved through there.

I knew a woman who lost both her parents and grand parents and the family home in Dresden. She was sent to live with relatives in the countryside. Really screwed up her head later in life. Leveling cities is nothing new in warfare. If anything, at least they get warning these days. Before good communication, your city is surrounded and your dead or enslaved.
I don't know much Arabic.  Is this something that is said in good times and bad, or is al-Aaruri not popular in the area?

Look up U.N and the Irish MP lists of that. They have bombed much more than ONE hospital and school. Many here believe everything israel says. When theyre in charge of all the tapes flowing into these channels. Listen, if you want to know and think you know what happens in this coflict. You gotta start listen to sources like U.N and Amnesty and NOT videoes postet on reddit pr western sources. They have full controll and were backed by US. You HAVE to include the possibility of both parts and be non biased to be able to find and see the truth from varipus sources.Its fake pictures FFS. there were no rockets coming from that part towards israel even, and israel went out saying it was not them straight away. As you can search up yourself, Norwegian doctor reporting from Gaza. Its civilians being bombed, childrens HOMES obliterated.And what military does just bomb civilians if there are someone even among them that might be against their course? Hamas is even created by israel after years of apartheid.Tiktok Comments dont allow copy links so you have to search up yourselves.
Yes. You made the point well and I just wanted to comment on it.
Kind of goes both ways‚Ä¶doesn‚Äôt it?  People in Gaza spitting on dead Israeli‚Äôs before they behead them, and Israeli‚Äôs chanting about Gaza not having water and power, and getting bombed Kind of a totally fucked up part of the world - not sure how anyone can feel justified supporting either side of the equation at this juncture.  They all suck
Agreed - that's a big part of my point...
I bought a VZ58 specifically because of the sniper scene.
Israel is going to face a difficult job in destroying hamas. Defensive fire power is an understanding of magnitude more powerfully than it has been. Yes, IDF has jets, helicopters, artillery, and rockets, but those are no good in CQC in tunnels or destroyed towns etc, hamas will try and keep as close as possible to the front of the IDF, nullifying the heavy weapons advantage. It's going to be a hard slog for Israel, and as they have shown on many occasions, they will keep going, and they will get the results that they want.
They‚Äôre gonna start making tiktoks of themselves naked, with people dressed as Nazis shaving their heads and taking group showers. Gotta keep reminding the world how they‚Äôre the victims in this. Freaking sociopaths.
Think it was in a thread just hours ago. Looked like someone told a mod to google something when they asked for source
Disgusting. Rules for thee and not for me. Besides this being a complete insult to Holocaust victims, Israel only demands that everyone else adheres to international law. They just outright don't.Powerful countries with the support of powerful countries in this world don't play by the rules and are just above the law. This is the unfortunate truth.
UK didn't vote against. They abstained from the vote.
1/4 of my family died wearing that star... the real one. When the world truly turned their back on them. This is despicable, to use the memory of millions of deaths to justify atrocities, in favor of your racial politics? DESPICABLE. HORRENDOUS.
Almost none of this would have happened if the UN resolutions were executed. You know why? Because Hamas wouldn't have gained any popularity or foothold in Gaza. It would have likely just remained a charity organization if it was ever born.
Amnesty International calls Israel an apartheid state.
WHERE IS SADDAM!?
You just described %90 of reddit users.
The Merk 3‚Äôs are probably the last of the column to enter, so we‚Äôre watching video at the back end. We‚Äôre obviously not going to get video immediately of actual sensitive operations.

The body language says it all, no one told them what to say or how to act. This is the strength of the message. It is transparent Netanyahu wants sacrifice of hostages as a card to have justification for his long planned war to ethnic cleanse Gaza
If Hamas hasn't figured it out already, they are about to learn real quick, they fucked up.
Translatelions are completely false.
Thank you :)

If you condemn Hamas but also criticise the Israeli government you are a full on hardcore Nazi apparently.

Sounds like a nightmare to work in a military armory on the starting weeks. Some units saw 150% of reservists called arriving - as in, everyone showed up immediately, and a bunch of people who weren't called up just volunteered.
Sounds like the tag line of some conflict happening at this moment in history.
It‚Äôs a car turning around and being shelled from behind. He‚Äôs clearly holding a camera with a telescopic lens. Nothing your comment said made sense at all and is entirely made up. But who are we going to believe, you or our own lying eyes?
"The end" is better translated as "Over". Some minor nuance is off, but overall an accurate translation.
There should be a disclaimer at the beginning of this video. ‚ÄúThese are 100% true opinions of hostages held by us, and we in no way shape or form Forced them to say these things.‚Äù
That‚Äòs not affected, as you‚Äòre not making any claims or spreading propaganda. (Well, unless you just start spamming screenshots/segments of it with no alterations/commentary/humor/whatever, which would have been removed under Rule 9 anyway)
"I'm the new sheriff in town and let me tell y'all, the legend of my quick draw isreal"
Israel is pretty small. From Sderot to Tel Aviv you need 1h of driving.After 9/11, the US didn't take military actions before months of cooling down. Their targets were on the other side of the world anyway.Hamas' biggest mistake by far is doing what they did knowing that they are only few minutes of flight from the nearest Israeli air base, and 1h of driving from Tel Aviv. If Israel wasn't a restrained democracy they'd have flattened Gaza without warning any civilians like they did.
You israeli?
\*displace not misplaceBut 100% agree with you. It's so utterly disrespectful to use the victims of the Holocaust to justify committing these evil atrocities.
Love this guys energy
Jewish Nazis following Adolf Hitler's playback ... casting themselves as victims ... DISGUSTING.

Israel has had surveillance drones routinely flying through the region for a long time, peeking through windows and just checking shut out.
As both Muslim and Arab, the problem lies with zionists and israel, not Jews. And as most of you already now know the root problem of the foundation itself since 1948 and what accompanied this since then.Medias are spreading a lot of misinformation which helps ignite and burn the line between being a zionist and a Jew. Demonstrations now are based on mass fury, and the media isn't helping, although a lot of Jews try to show the difference.  Of course there are Jews globally that support israel but again, there are others that don't support them.
Booooooo! It's Palestinian West Bank that Israel rules over with apartheid. Palestinians don't make it a war zone, the settler terrorists do by stealing homes and committing pograms with the protection of the IDF.

IDF tank, that blocked the road, shoots civilian car that tried to do an u-turn.
There was a recent UN vote for a truce in gaza that that won 120 - 14 with 45 abstentions. Obviously US, UK and Israel voted against. Israel is super pissed they lost that vote and has stated that UN is a farce, not fit for purpose etc etc, and is now resorting to victim complex and guilt tripping tactics.

I've heard that there's like 100k people on Gaza and about 200k focused on the north, though that was a couple weeks ago though, no clue what's the reality on the ground now
Who makes these people
Jezus, they really just used the holocaust in ww2 to justify their own version of it?? Victim complex to the max
Cringe I need my misinformation
When you don‚Äôt have truth on your side, you have to resort to theatrics. ‚ÄúPot calling the kettle black‚Äù should be in the Israeli national anthem.Really shameful to Jews who actually suffered during the holocaust.
That's a lot of vehicle's, I'm interested how much of the army is in gaza compared to the northern front. Logically speaking it would make more sense that a larger percentage of the army to be held at the northern front as a war with hezbollah would be orders of magnitude larger and more intense.
They flattened and busted everything. The soldiers marching with they're weapons like that means there's not a soul left in there.
State sponsored terrorism really unblurs the lines.
Like when Benjamin Netanyahu said the Nazis were not responsible for the Holocaust and that it was the Palestinians because they "persuaded Hitler to do it". https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-34594563They will throw everything they can at justifying what they do.
Oppressing and committing genocide against a group of people in the name of the victims of genocide and oppression. Disgusting
Hard to releases hostages when the odds are extremely likely they were blown up by the people wanting them freed.
Invoking the Holocaust bc you're being criticized for indiscriminate bombings and apartheid is really gross.

Why do IDF wear such thingys on their helmets?
The USA was in the mix for more than just the last year of the war. Thats just basic math and historical fact. I wont argue the Isreal /Palastine conflict because it is a much more complex topic with historical  roots that are far deeper than I wish to exhume. However, when you minimalize, mistate, and trivialize known historical truths by saying the US only entered WW2 in the last year you must understand that you lose any sort of authority or believability in your arguments because you are either ignorant of the facts or are purposely misstating facts to sensationalize your answers and arguments which discredit yourself.
You have a good heart.
There is somekind of dark irony in this... gimmick.Today's ultraprivileged taking an advantage of suffering of the past's underprivileged.Tasteless, embarrassing and downright disrespectful indeed.

They said roof knocking would no longer be the default, not that they would stop doing it entirely. There is plenty of video evidence of them continuing the practice after those statements were made.  Depends entirely on the target though.

Yea, and unlike in the open fields of Ukraine, speed is likely not a huge benefit in urban fighting for a tank.  Tanks aren't my specialty but as EOD I can't imagine if I'm in a building with an RPG7 firing down that a tank can get out of my line of sight with speed.  Might as well add the weight and hope for the best.

Imagine being such a piece of shit that you turn a holocaust star into a fascist symbol by putting it on to justify a genocide.
To my knowledge they still do it.
Huh, if they are so keen for the UN to do something, why doesn't Israel do things that the UN has resolved they should do? You know, to be fair and equitable?Here's the [full list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Nations_resolutions_concerning_Israel), I'm sure you can see which resolutions Israel has been ignoring, for decades... particularly the ones from 1967 on...
The IDF heavly reduces the resolution of the footage they release
Fascists always do that. If you go back and look at atrocities and look at the propaganda that was used to justify it, the aggressor always paints themselves as the victim and says they are defending themselves. Jason Stanley‚Äôs ‚ÄòHow Fascism Works‚Äô is a good read, or his interviews on youtube.

This is so disrespectful to holocaust victims it makes me sick. Putting that on as they are trying to carry out a genocide is so cynical and disgusting. Israelis truly have no shame left at all.
i mean if youre from the US, no worries. your government taxes you for the chosen people already. but if that makes you happy,go for it :)
I think it's just cope at this point, realizing Israel isn't going to ceasefire.

I've heard they have many uses. Cover from heat aswell as shape obstruction.
The levels of destruction in Gaza are insane right now. According to the IDF, 15% of the buildings there are already gone, with most of those in the Northern half of the strip.
I did not hear ONE English word in that altercation. I thought, learning English or French was a necessity to be in Canada.Not only the disgusting images of a gang beating a person when they are already down.
ok, but do you condom hummus?
I stopped that was another "Hamas misfire" then was it??
Wear the stars or wear a thong, you already lost all the sympathy.If half of what they did to gaza happened to them, they will start sending nukes everywhere like there is no tomorrow.This is absolutely disgusting.
I see they are going for a "fake it till everyone believes" tactic in defeating IDF. With the goal to spread so much disinfo that people start demanding ceasefire cause it's a stalemate. Why it makes me so sure it's straight from a russian playbook.
Every perpetrator views themselves as the victim‚Ä¶
They are downplaying the holocaust.
Most countries have some kind of helmet cover, just not this exaggerated.
All American taxpayers support it, to be clear. And the vast majority of baby boomers and Gen X support Israel unconditionally according to polls. Like 80+%. Only among millennials/gen Z is it more like 50-50
So these Hamas fighters managed to cross all this open terrain without being detected?
Why would you feel the need to do that?
Or just recording military vehicles because they're interesting? Look at how hard the camera man flinches when it explodes.
And how.  They conflate antisemitism with anti-zionism, thereby giving validation to every genuine antisemite out there.  They are saying "if you don't like what we're doing you hate Jews" and a lot of people (especially muslims) are thinking "OK so we hate Jews then".  I'm sure it sucks to be Jewish right now.  Antisemitism is on the rise and the Israeli government are the assholes making it happen.
Classic appeal to empathy while playing the victim. It‚Äôs their signature move
This man‚Äôs restraint is admirable, staring into the faces of those absolute scum. I know many Jewish people who openly support Palestine, not because they believe in their religion etc but because they are genuine people. Now I don‚Äôt know anybody from ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äù in my daily life atleast (I‚Äôm in NZ) the Jewish people I know, who understand what their ancestors went through would NEVER condemn that on anybody regardless of religion. Fucking disgusting and the fact this conflict is backed by the USA totally proves how fucked humanity is. And this is just one of many issues/conflicts with humanity. It‚Äôs really hard to have faith in anything when you read into what‚Äôs going on around the world.
Why do you condemn us when we murder innocent people?
Only an insane person would believe this. If any israeli would kill or order the killing of an israeli hostage they would spend the rest of his life in hiding.
Mods are filtering out propaganda.  They upped restrictions on account ages and other metrics.  You‚Äôll know it‚Äôs a bot if its extremely partisan and devoid of reasonable discussion.
Casting yourself as the victim is textbook Nazi stuff. "Those people we're slaughtering are bullying us!"It's the exact same behaviour and ideology. They just swapped a few nouns and changed their logo.

Exactly. Israel was condemned several times boy ONU and other internacional entities for war crimes against palestinian ppl. What Hamas are doing is wrong. But Israel what Israel have done and do is equivalent or more worse.
The thing that made me giggle is that you picked a range of territory that entirely miss the conflict zone. (It would cover east and south of the Middle East and the entire east of africa) covering almost only countries that has one of the worst life expectancy(even worst then in gaza).When your point is that the claim is too ambitious, your range is a worst deal geography wise XD.
Oh so thats why they blew up their own hospital and tried blaming Israel riiiight
Classic, I swear for those people Holocaust is the best thing which happened. Every time this  same emotional pressure so they can do everything they want. I don't know what can be more degrading to the victims of  Nazi atrocities then using them to  misplace and bomb millions of people in your private concentration camp.
I‚Äôm worried about western countries! Don‚Äôt look good with several supporters on the streets

They stated weeks ago that they stopped roof knocking. And ofc, they don't roof knock on special targets.

If only there could be less pixels, would be great.
Where‚Äôs that meme of the kid putting the boot on his own face. Israel isn‚Äôt a victim here.
Fuck Israel.
Bakhmut, Grozny, Aleppo, Gaza. We are seeing a pattern here, It seems the generals have decided the most effective method of urban combat is to pretty much level the city before sending in the troops.
Where can I listen to the whole thing?
They don't drop leaflets for this purpose (which would scatter all over the place, making it unclear what the target is). That would be dumb. They use an inert bomb and "knock" the roof with it.
Justification to commit atrocities
Well, they've played their Ace card now. Not sure there is anything after the bottom of a barrel?
Glad to see not everyone in Hollywood has there head firmly planted in there own ass. I‚Äôve always thought kinda highly intellectually speaking of both these guys.
Bomb them all
Pathetic
Not at all mate, we were just having a laugh. It helps with such serious topics. Good health to you, and all who reads this.
If Hamas hadn‚Äôt attacked Israel and taken hostages none of this would be happening. Wake up. Israel‚Äôs reaction is brutal but what did anyone expect. Wake up to what Iran and HAMAS are doing.
As soon as there was footage from the ground operations, I noticed merkava 3's being used, I just thought it was strange
Goddamn the Israeli government makes it hard to root for Israel.
‚ÄúSafe house‚Äù. Don‚Äôt think so.
You could have titled this as "2 random shots of black dots moving screen left to screen right" So much for the narrative.
Well reddit started enforcing a policy of banning footage if it was created,edited and manufactured by hamas by claims of supporting and spreading terrorism , so I doubt we'll get much footage here by them .
Door knocking still in effect. I figured at this point they would have considered leaflet dropping as an official door knock....
Nonsense.Devastation of this proportion requires at least level 2 ability with the force or a voodoo buff.
It's interesting to see they are carrying so much equipment: with such short line of communication and no way for Hamas to disrupt the logistic, I'd thought they would have entered with lighter carry
Its no longer Brampton, its little India
Problem is those caught in middle, I would love for Hamas to just disappear too
Would you rather not have it?
They obviously sent a warning
It's true that mk3's were phased out of the active army but they stayed on reserve duty units.That being said, seeing mk3's without the d.baz upgrade packagde ( identified by the buffed side cheeks for the turret ) in action was relatively rare - this one in the video was probably pulled out of deep deep  storage
Mexico is godawful. Theyve had over 30k annual deaths for years now.
Seeking justification to expand their country.
How "lucky" or "informed" of a cameraman can you be?
Why not from "Afghanistan," to  "Zimbabwe." ü§î
They are "lossing the plot."
Isreal beleavies what they are doing it mornal. (it is not)
I guess we just accept that Israel is aiming for military targets uncritically. The genocide is very much happening to Palestinians as it has been since 1948. Israelis are motivated by hate, look at any surveys about their views towards Arabs and Muslims.
I don‚Äôt think they were asked about this moment in history, they were asked about a bus stop, by a guy calling people racists to their face. They were asked about something they have no control over and then blamed for the situation and called a racist, by an angry stranger, who was videotaping them, so he could virtue signal all around the world.
Bruh .... You're so spoiled.....this is an IMAX type of war...not the highly effective drones from Amazon.
Israel has a much higher civilian hit rate over the e last 20 years
There is no obvious sign of entry.  Maybe they used magic.
Isreal likes to do that.
You punch me in the face, I wipe you off the planet.
You can drop a bomb that detonates below the foundation.  I doubt that Israel send casual demolition workers in there to place charges‚Ä¶
Dew it
Hamas has [a tunnel system hundreds of kilometers long](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/hamas-tunnel-city-beneath-gaza-hidden-frontline-israel-2023-10-26/), described as "Viet Cong times 10".  The average person doesn't know about this so they don't understand to the complexity of the combat situation this presents.  Politics of this whole mess aside, if an army is sending their soldiers into a large city with hidden combatants and they have the ability to destroy the buildings and in turn the tunnel networks under it before they advance, they're going to do it.  Rather than risking hundreds of their own troops being injured and killed.  Just how it is. And of course, sandwiched between Hamas and the IDF, civilians will be the biggest losers.
For fucks sake, how do you expect me to be able to use massive deuce as an insult  now? You've ruined it!
I‚Äôm just searching for some honesty in this sea of propaganda
M-I-C-K-E-Y M-O-U-S-E
With ukraine vs russia everyone was one big friend in this sub. It was clear who the bad and good guys were. So there was almost no footage upvoted from the russian side that showed them performing a good action. Those were always labeled as unreliable or old. I'm really curious to see what footage will be downvoted in this war.
Has he doesn‚Äôt realise when it wasn‚Äôt there  and people went on the bus,  the bus blew up quite often.
Yeah ‚ÄúTypical (insert any nationality) mindset‚Äù is pretty much doing the same thing that this this guy is doing. Not going all the way and claiming they‚Äôre all the enemy like he is, but basically saying they‚Äôre all the same. And even if the majority of Israelis did have this mindset, can we really all sit here and say that we wouldn‚Äôt as well if we were raised in the same environment with the same teachings. We can‚Äôt stop the villainization of one nationality, race, or religion by vilainizing another entire nationality, race or religion just because some of them are the ones doing the villainization to begin with.

Good friend you have.
theyre in freaking tunnels that their bombs cant penetrate, yet they are supposed to know where those tunnels exit and open, israeli special forces should have been in gaza getting the hostages free and someone should have sent a cheque to qatar to get those hamas leaders who aren't even in the strip. It does not seem israel is in any way interested to free it's people or to have peace themselves. also, if you believe the narrative (of which i see no definite evidence of yet) that there is an element where netanyahu might have something to gain from destroying gaza and removing the israeli judiciary, then you can absolutely understand the words the woman said.
yeah a friend did this, so I just asked him
Even Yad Vashem found the move inappropriate by the UN ambassador
Isn't everyone already condemning Hamas?  I don't get what point he is trying to make.
And before bakmut, allepo in 2016
Either I‚Äôm blind or OP should be banned for this
That was just weird and inappropriate.
What in the Black Mirror clown shit...The actual fck.
Is that what those are for? I don't think I've seen them before, and was wondering what their purpose it... They look a bit unwieldy...
Hamas can't fight a ground war, they can burn babys alive
Average genocide enjoyer.
I‚Äôve seen very few engagements from them today (although that could easily be due to internet being disabled in Gaza). Hamas is not an organisation designed for conventional warfare so I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôll see that much activity for the next day or two.
Yes, Hamas doesn't give two monkeys about the people of Gaza. It openly uses them as shields ( which is against the rules of war). Gaza has billions of dollars in aid from the West, including the US and EU. Where does it go? To the leaders, and they aren't there! Most of, if not all of Hamas weapons storage, bunkers, tunnel systems, and HQs are located in &amp; under buildings like schools or hospitals. Isis did the same, but we never questioned how we systematically cleared city strongholds in Iraq or Syria. The issue here is that it's Isreal

At home? they are not even sleeping in bonkers in Gaza, they ran away before the massacare started.
Correct, the explosion is from under the structure.
Are we answering questions with questions now? Are you being antagonistic for a reason?Surely you actually want to find the right answer and you don‚Äôt just wanna fight, right?
. @robert_martin_palestine on ig. He recently started to post again.
"YOU HAVE ALERTED THE HORDE‚ö†Ô∏è"
Yup, that's why I brought it up.
They have to cope somehow
If it‚Äôs just a Hamas issue then why is Israel also bombing and raiding the West Bank?
Police are not military. The set of all people can be partitioned into disjoint sets: military and not military. The latter is also denoted "civilians".
Technically, translated, that's kinda what they are saying.
Nah after seeing what hamas did to innocent civilians I hope they get wiped off the face of the planet
Counter-Terrorists Win
Just like people who can hold entire conversations with nothing but "OMG".
I know what he's saying may still be relevant blah blah blah but this video is a few years old.
Both sides' civilian do not deserve getting indiscriminately killed ButI don't see IDF hiding behind civilians, building military installation in civilian area, Israel has a much lower death because they have a functioning government that spent billions on the Iron Dome and are willing to trade 1000 prisoners for 1 hostage. Hamas don't give a shit about Palestinian. If Hamas have a chooce to kill 100 Jews or improve the lives of 1 million Palestinians, we all know what they will choose.
We can do both.
black square go boom, title: '20 hamas leaders DESTROYED'
Extremely brave of both of them to say these things.
The fucking actual fuck this fuck thinking he's fucking doing? For fuck's sake this is lightyears beyond too far.
Terrorists regularly use civilian cars. Not military.
Who you gonna cal?!
That's the extent of their thought process.
Sponsored by the US tax payer‚Äôs!! Americans are you happy???
I don't know if there is one hamas leader dumb enough to sleep at home nowdays.
To put it front and center the balls of this Aussie . Respect ‚úä
Kinda funny when this guy fires the UBGL at 00:16, probably missing the intended target, and the camerguy going "UGHHH"
So you admit they were idf in that car?
This is an insult to holocaust victims
But as you said, possible, so all bets are off right?
Wow some of these places must have been storing tons of munitions
Shooting at your civilians trying to evacuate is a war crime. According to the Geneva conventions (and virtually every other modern convention, e.g. Hague) hiding your missile launchers inside civilian buildings make said buildings a LEGIT MILITARY TARGET. Or, what would you do in the IDF‚Äôs shoes, whose job is to protect innocent Israeli civilians? Would you just blindly accept being shot at with thousands of rockets a day, thereby succumbing to terrorists when they hide behind civilians? Please, share your thoughts
Top post on that sub right now is from a lady who‚Äôs a facist who claimes that all protests are antisemitism. That sub really got filled with Nazis
Why do they keep saying the same thing?
this isn't a strike, but controlled demolition
Thought they were cosplaying as sheriffs
So hamas expected to attack Israel and that was it? No retaliation? Definitely not the smartest bunch
Don't look safe to me üòÇ
Ammo, grenades, water, food, NVGs, comms and a sleeping system.Looks like they're staying the night and need to be ready to fight.If contacted with a bergan on you just drop it. Pretty standard stuff for infantry on the sharper end of it, you need to be self sufficient.
Because the "combatant" you see might not be really combatant lol. Remind me of the black mirror episode with the filter on the eyes of soliders
True Aussie legend. Our mate, our Cunt.
Why does no other army use these kind of helmet nets to obscure their shape?
Ok thank you
I think you mean the ‚Äònot so safe house‚Äô
Cope Kippah
Go on SouthFirsrResponders telegram, has all the videos from the attack including this. Can‚Äôt link a civilian murder video here.
so it's written in the bible folks. everyone go home now. lol.it's pretty fucked up if an Australian is calling you racist.
I loved the transition into the next shot where as far as you can see there is just rubble from blown apart buildings.

The war went from silent phase to open phase. War is always ugly.
Where ~~banana~~ Saddam?
Imagine being so delusional that you think that wearing a nationalistic symbol would give you more sympathy.
Whats the status if the ground war? Seems like Hamas has retreated?
why would I bother listening to a single thing an Israeli spy has to say? He's a spy, his mission is to confuse, lie, obfuscate, and generally push the Mossad line. It's like asking me to listen to the testimony of a CIA or FSB agent. There's no point.
Wait?? Didn't they say they had run out of fuel??? So if the did how did this car drives??Might it be a Hamas car packed with explosives??Rear suspension looking under a lot of stress.And how convenient that there was a car behind it with professional photographer equipment to capture the whole event, so if the manage to exploded the Thay can get a great victory video from it and if the fail they can fram it as a family getting murdered.
Infantry? I thought you said carpentry!
I bet IDF has some next level shit for the tunnel rats Like some 3d map of the entire network, along with heat signatures
Oh man that sub is a complete circle jerk, they‚Äôve posted a video of ‚Äúhurt‚Äù IDF soldiers when in reality it was just combat medic training. They really think the carriers are for Gaza üíÄ
At first glance I thought the water puddle was it, but on closer look it isn't. I'm almost tempted to make OP re-submit, because that feels like a major oversight.https://i.imgur.com/M7LkSPY.jpghttps://i.imgur.com/ll0dEMc.jpg
The Hamas would be completely wiped out by now if they didn‚Äôt use innocents as shields
PATHETIC SCABS!
Can you link the full video
Haven't seen anyone mention that they seem to be using  merkava 3's. I thought they didn't use them anymore.
The framing of this issue as a religious conflict goes beyond oversimplifying and right into lies. 'Palestinian' is a regional ethnic Arab identity indigenous to the historic land of Palestine and a portion of Jordan. There are black Palestinians, and there are red-headed Palestinians. Palestine is and was majority Muslim for a long time, but there were and still are Christian, Jewish, Druze, Baha'i, atheist etc Palestinians. All are persecuted in the occupied territories and second class citizens at best in Israel proper. Anyone who tells you Arab Israelis have the same rights as Jewish ones is lying to you. Israel facilitated and encouraged Jews from across the Middle East to emigrate in order to boost demographics in its early years and decades, and more recently has facilitated the inclusion of African Jews to that list, whilst never avoiding the institutional and cultural racism within Israeli society that followed both those population transfer projects. But zionism is a western, colonial project. Its pioneers were white Europeans. Its first backers were the British who used it as a presence to project power in the region, and the US uses and supports it unconditionally for the same reason.The earliest zionists and the founders of the modern state spoke in explicitly colonialist terms. I can quote them to you, and you can find those words yourself online easily enough. It's no different or even historically separate to how Europe carved up Africa and the rest of the Middle East post-ww1. There's no honest reason for anyone who recognises what Europe did in and to Africa and Africans, for power and profit, to not unequivocally condemn the zionist project in Israel for doing and being exactly the same thing.
Polish? The language sounds Slavic but I can‚Äôt place it
suddenly i want to be an IDF twink
That Israel is doing the most while the surrounding Arab countries wouldn‚Äôt even say they did it.
2 billon Arabs to only 16 million Jews. No shit Palestine has more support
The best was over on r/Palestine, a video saying that the west are cowards for bringing 2 whole aircraft carriers just for little old Gaza, and look how terrified they must be of Gaza, etc.
On the extremely unlikely off-chance that you aren't being a disingenuous POS, [this](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fexternal-preview.redd.it%2FqI_JjXA-J9FgK1hRH6-uVQGDIDNXN4g_b9rWXFcHSic.jpg%3Fauto%3Dwebp%26s%3D68251161b856dc93fb130ceaad181c667c2d8e04) should answer your question.
most likely dropped leaflets on and that's why, what's your point?

My man at 0.15 seconds is building a wall/barricade like in Fortnite
The Israelis often warn ahead of time when a home will be destroyed. There is even a hotline you can call once your building has been designated for destruction. I believe they may not be offering warnings at the moment though.
Probably had petrol in the car from before and haven't driven it much
It‚Äôs not a cope cage, it‚Äôs a Yarmulke
Not taking sides when a genocide is happening is weak shit honestly
Most of it is in the hamas charter. the incest thing, i don't know.
But did he condemn Hamas??
My god is much bigger than yours. My god can walk right through the door.
At 37s that's a lot of Ammunition inside the mosque
The sad part is that girl is now worth $25 million.
Look, that is true, however no one needs this video to understand how much more useful these hostages are to Benny from Philly as martyrs than as living citizens.
even technology transfer would boost Ukrainian self defence effort
Idk man, i'm pretty good with I spy books and I couldn't locate Saddam in this picture.
Love it when they know exactly where to film.
For Israel, and for now they‚Äôll probably work, just because Hamas has made gravity drone-drops in the past.  If Hamas survives long enough, their weapons and methods could change, and Israel will have to evolve with those changes.
Why would Netanyahu want them back? They're way more useful to his political ambitions dead. That's exactly what this lady is learning, probably the hard way, likely after letting him stay in power, unless she happens to be one of the few campaigners against him.
Where is he..? **WHERE IS HE?!**
I‚Äôm glad they started the rebuilding efforts toward the end of the vid
Hamas are cowards scared to engage directly
Multiple reports of gun fights between infantry
It seems like a fair few people care.
My parents went over to Israel/Palestine with a Christian mission as Israel supporters came back completely pro Palestine. Unfortunately this stuff needs to be shoved in your face for people to get it
no they arent lol
It's going to be many hours or even days of no combat at all followed by sudden terrible combat with lots of aggressive do-or-die attacks and lots of munitions thrown at them. Best to spread way out and be very ready. Mistrust every building or person you see. They're likely hiding deep, even underground. It's not going to be pretty if Hamas doesn't get smart and surrender -- which they won't. It could take more than weeks to do this, and even then it might not work. Hamas may just fade away to who knows where. Then IDF gets to blow up all their tunnels and arrest all the young men from age 16-40 and interrogate them. Not nice and going to infuriate every Palestinian. It would almost be better to just bulldoze the whole place, but you can't very well do that.Either that or leave the tunnels alone and map them all. That way, if Hamas comes back again -- which they will -- IDF can head straight for all the tunnel exits and take care of business. I like that plan much better.
Gonna? It's already became Bakhmut before Bakhmut itself
What‚Äôs the difference? Edit: Nvm, fascists don‚Äôt get immunity from their war crimes
Watch the Israeli propagandists say it their fault for  not leaving Gaza soon enough
For urban environments like Gaza where you could get shot with an RPG from a building high up it seems like it would be a decent idea to add additional defense to the tank. And honestly what is the drawback to doing it? It's not like Hamas is a near peer army. I reckon Israeli tank crews would be doing anything they can to protect armour in cities.
Smart.
Godspeed boy and girls!
And I have a feeling that‚Äôs on a weekend when everyone was dressed there best had a bottle of alcohol and Newport‚Äôs üòÖ
 Killing and forced displacement of civilians in order to seize land also cannot be justified as an act of self-defence.It's important to note that the treatment of hostages in this situation was notably different from the treatment of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli prisons. The Israeli prisons have faced allegations of prisoner mistreatment and torture. In contrast, Hamas took these hostages with the primary goal of negotiating the release of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli prisons.
They love being the aggressor and then crying victim when someone defends themselves.
Don‚Äôt forget about the ‚Äú10 destroyed Zionist tanks‚Äù and ‚Äúhow the Zionist fled after we shot them‚Äù remarks on social media.
I don't understand how being more clear by specifying Palestinians in Gaza rather than all Palestinians is planting some image in people's heads that would make them more dismissive of the violence happening.
M.i.c.k.e.y. M.o.u.s.e.
Bunch of dogs!
You forgot the /s
I was really hoping for a Sparta kick
General: "You see that city, soldier?  ...I don't want to."
This really isn‚Äôt that heavy for a regular ‚Äúexpected contact‚Äù infantry action
Of course the Australian aboriginals have and do suffer, but that is an irrelevant talking point and has no relevance to the point being made in this video in the context of Israel.
did you mean to say "a child chucking a rock is the same as someone using a weapon made to kill, therefore theyre allowed to shoot kids with rocks"a child with a rock has nowhere near the power that a man with a sling has. this isnt a justification for shooting children. why do you even have a justification for shooting children?
"I don't live here....yet"
Not a single Hamas soldier in sight. Probably hiding behind women and children in hospitals and schools just to cry about evil Israel bombing them
They need to take the dome out or a double rocket for when it gets destroyed the other can. Blow when it falls
If I turned to supporting what Hamas and their inhuman tactics I think it would cost me my humanity. If your neighbor kept stealing from you and harassing you would you react by dismembering his son and raping his daughter? Israel can be in the wrong but it doesn't somehow give permission to Palestinians to turn to Hamas.
What a strong man. I don't even understand what this guy is going through and how he can find the motivation to get up.
They don‚Äôt give a fuck. All American politicians are too gutless or bought out by Israeli lobbyists to do anything but kiss their ass and the media will just regurgitate Israeli propaganda without even the pretense of trying to cover both sides. They just have to ride out the bad PR from the Palestinian genocide until a few decades from now it will just become something like slavery or America‚Äôs own genocide against the Native Americans: a dark, inconvenient footnote in history that most people would rather ignore than remember
Sry what was that about ad hominem you mentioned before? Lol. Man you really like abusing the word "literally" and I'm not sure you know what the word "schizophrenic" means but ok. And actually no I do have an argument and that argument is don't fucking harass random people on the street regardless of what crime you think they have committed. It's pretty straight forward. Oh and since you're very clearly ignorant of world events outside your short attention span. Yes the aboriginals of Australia do suffer the effects of colonialism TODAYhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-53436225But you don't really give a shit about that do you?
Near Toronto.
But there is a reason why Poland had the most Jews out of every country. It wasn't perfect for them but still better than anywhere else which says more about the rest of Europe than Poland tbh.
The stupidest part is those same people will claim with a completely straight face that stuff like the USS Liberty or the various massacres of Palestinians and political assassinations by the early Israeli settlers  were a long time ago and the aggrieved parties should just get over it
Are there Hamas soilders to fight? Or have they all legged it?
That's not a cope cage, it's a tank yarmulke.
His actions streamlined this whole fucking mess ya silly goose.
He means brown lmao
I think you missed him taking the piss, mate.
When it‚Äôs Israeli civilians they‚Äôre innocent. When it‚Äôs Palestinian civilians it‚Äôs ‚Äúviable military targets‚Äù and ‚Äútheir fault for being governed by Hamas‚Äù unless, of course, it‚Äôs civilians in the West Bank getting murdered by Israel and then the shill msm will just ignore it
hardly anyone mourned Israelis dead civilians. all they did was celebrating it. that is why idf is furious
&gt; crewed by men and women in heterosexual relationships*Impossible*, surely that can't be?
You still haven‚Äôt answered any of my arguments. Keep trying to distract with absolutely invalid and useless talking points. It‚Äôs truly a waste of time talking with someone with such a useless thought pattern. Comparing modern Australians with literal occupying Israeli settlers, who are zealot Orthodox Jews who are literal citizens of other countries and still settling TODAY, come from abroad with their entire families to literally steal land in modern times, is delusional. They‚Äôre violating international laws with their settlements and walling people off. Are you ok? To compare this with modern Australia is to be literally schizophrenic. It‚Äôs just a desperate move by someone with no argument. A classic ‚Äúyeah, but ‚ÄúLmao, ‚Äúlosing land sucks‚Äù, they are literally segregating people and regularly violating international humanitarian law in addition to the original land stealing started 78 years ago. It‚Äôs just clear that you‚Äôve picked a side and you‚Äôre willing to do anything to see them in a positive light, even to be as desperate as to try to make everyone look as bad to convince yourself it‚Äôs normal. The focus here is on what Israel is doing to Palestine and no one else. Anyone can comment on that from any nation. You are just trying to distract because you know that what you‚Äôre seeing is wrong and you cannot defend it without diverting and redirecting
Palestine didn't even exist as a country prior to ww2.
&gt; You‚Äôre attacking the individual because you‚Äôre intellectually incapable of taking on the actual situation being presented in the video.And you're incapable of seeing the world outside the narrow view of your little computer screen. We all in this world have benefited from some sort of suffering or another. But you're to privilege and ignorant to see it because you're hyper fixated on what's going on right now.Yeah losing land sucks. That doesn't give you permission to harass people for occupying said land they had no part in taking. You especially don't get to fucking talk if you yourself also benefit from "stolen land". &gt;so you need to do everything you can to turn attention away from the evils of Israel because it isn‚Äôt convenient for you to seeWow you people have a wild imagination. I have the audacity to defend one lowly jew from harassment and all of the sudden I'm turning away from the evils of israel.&gt;Not only is that not a response to what I said, but it also barely makes any senseBro half of your comments make zero fucking sense. I thought you were being vague intentionally to sound smart (a common reddit tactic). You're just like "ur sO loSt tHeRE" like that means anything.
Looks like they have gone with the remove the urban method of urban combat.

Not only is that not a response to what I said, but it also barely makes any sense
Even more funny coming from someone so utterly incapable of articulating one's actual issue with me. You're just whining for the sake of whining.
The entire outline of what you were trying to do here was just to distract from the argument being made in the video. ad hominem. You‚Äôre attacking the individual because you‚Äôre intellectually incapable of taking on the actual situation being presented in the video. Or, you‚Äôre just too complicit and personally involved, so you need to do everything you can to turn attention away from the evils of Israel because it isn‚Äôt convenient for you to see
Plenty of people support hamas, the exhilarated cornell prof' for example. And all squares are rectangles.
Cheated
You don‚Äôt even know what irony is my friend
Man some of these pictures really appear to tell a story. Good post.
Yes that was the point nothing happened. He didn‚Äôt confront Putin who was proven to have meddled in the 2016 election. That‚Äôs fact
He met him, nothing ever happened üòÜ ü§£ putin is a made up story by Hillary Clinton proved fake so.
Oh the irony
Tavor gens 1,2 &amp;3, M4s, CAR 15s, Negev MG gens 1&amp;2.
What type of small arms are these guys carrying? I'm not too familiar with their equipment.
And you‚Äôre one of the people who believe trump made it so we didn‚Äôt have to buy any oil from Iran? And you‚Äôre also under the assumption the money we pay Iran for oil is making it possible for hamas to operate? How many conspiracy theories are you into?
That money isn't shit compared to the oil money, and freezing isn't taking it back. Oil money is like 200 million are more a year.
We don‚Äôt know do we.
Thats what terrorists do
It‚Äôs always soon with you guys
Trump is the one who bent over backwards for our enemies, remember Kim Jon un and Putin? He made us the laughing stock of the world twice in a Row
Just pointing out the rest of the crimes these monsters committed.
Exactly, we don‚Äôt know
IDF tank recently blew up a white car with 3 civilian in it. People were saying how do we know they were civilians. I guess the same applies here, how do we know there were civilians in the car? Could easily be IDF members.
We will soon
We froze the money we gave them as soon as the attack happened lmao.
Wow, you are really lost there. It went right over your head. I‚Äôm pretty impressed.
I'm not a conservative, you idiot shows how fucking stupid liberal lames are.
Do you have evidence for Biden taking bribes?
Step 1) "We need to clear out the area around the existing settlement for safety. So that area is ours now."Step 2) "Well we've got this free area near our existing settlement... let's go put some people there."Step 3) Go to step 1
I just picture IDF rolling up in the Mystery Machine...
I ain't got time, but don't give terrorist like Iran money lift sanctions on their oil bend over backward for our enemy he just tries to bribe them. That's how Biden is taken bribes, too
Fucking scumbags
I totally agree with himFree Palestine..from Hamasand from IsraelReturn the original Palestinian land. Acknowledge atrocities from both sides and punish whoever done the humanitarian crimes starting from 1946. Let Palestinian have a chance to self determine and create a governing body that is acknowledged by the UN and keep geopolitical intervention to minimum in the area. Disband Zionism and the state of Israel.Glad you love to hear that opinion.
Lmao, when you ask a conservative to explain their views
The people smiling at the bus stop...Holy fuck.
Ammo... Ammo and more ammo... And then more ammo.Then water, food, batteries, cloths, extra combat stuff. We fight without the big backpacks if we have contact. Some of the newer backpacks have fast release.
I have massive respect for this guy
You're a idiot dude warship grow up some
How does his policies suck? Explain
It's funny how stupid your comment was. Biden sucks and his weak ass policies. Why were in this mess
Now Israel is killing all of these Hamas terrorists and taking over operational control of Gaza for good. Lol..hooray for Israel. Don't ever give that land back to those lunatics.
But he started no wars, something you were just worshiping trump for
Obama sucked to just like Biden
Look who's talking. A man who doesn't control where he was born is harassing a man who also doesn't control where he was born. Your hypocrisy makes me extremely uncomfortable.
Well said!
No wars? Obama started no wars either. What‚Äôs your argument there? Or do you think the president actually controls what wars will happen in other parts of the world? That‚Äôs a silly and centric line of thought
‚ÄúWho's the leader of the club that's made for you and me.... ‚Äú
Yeah cuz America sure isn't fighting to give any land back to the natives.
No wars had them in their place and scared you people are the problem
You are not responsible for where you are born. You‚Äôre just trying to undermine this man in his visibly serious compassion because you know everything he saying is right, and it makes me extremely uncomfortable
Funny you call me racist after going on a tangent that ended with an anti immigration argument. Conservatives never learn. I‚Äôm interested in your point of view though. How do you justify being a trump supporter?
Ya
Hummus isn't in the West Bank..
Shit you the racist party antisemitic scum
No one is god‚Äôs people. Anyone rational has noticed that God does not exist at this point.
Seth takes a lot of crap because his laugh makes him sound like your stereotypical idiot stoner. But he's actually a pretty smart and articulate individual. Who happens to sound like a stereotypical idiot stoner.
Wtf r u saying the conflict started long before
Also nice little anti immigrant comment at the end, conservatives will always be the racist party. Coward
Do you people actually believe this rhetoric? How exactly did Donald trump leave the Middle East in peace? That‚Äôs such an ignorant statement it‚Äôs no wonder conservatives like you are laughed at. Can‚Äôt get trumps dick out of your mouth. Pathetic. I know you won‚Äôt debate me, because I know you‚Äôre here just to preach to the choir.
IDF troops take over buildings and setup inside while waiting for Engineering, Tanks and Airforce to do their jobs so they might be staying inside the same position for a few days, obviously they'll be getting supplies from their staging ground but in the meantime they will use what they brought with them as well, many bring stuff they bought themselves like those camping gas thingies to brew coffee and other shit to make themselves more comfortable.
Because usually these walks aren‚Äôt dependent on vehicles, they‚Äôre taking warm clothes, food and water, and the most important thing, coffee. Probably gonna camp the night there.
Pulls a knife out at the end...  I'm filled with rage.
Snatch her phone out her hand send it over the bridge. See ya
Totally agree, just like people who *feel* the 2020 election was 'stollen'.
Lol. Simple take.   Not smarter though
Supplies will be patchy/tenuous while they establish themselves...  Always nice to get a brew on...
I would pump water from the sea and flood the shit out of Hamas .. biblical style
the whole vid was like full metal jacket
Here‚Äôs a translation from another thread. Obviously we don‚Äôt know for sure but the people in the video seemed to think there was a family in the car. https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/s/q71pJksI2n
They barricaded houses, looks like they staying the night inside gaza
Yes
Anyone have some sort of translation or are we assuming we all speak whatever they are talking ?
already looks like scenes from full metal jacket
To be clear, i dont think anyone supports HAMAS, but they dont want INNOCENT PALESTINIANS to suffer the same fate as Hamas. Not all squares are rectangles.
We don‚Äôt want them here at all, they are not welcome!
Why do they have such heavy backpacks when their main base is probably a few tens of km away?? Let alone their staging area which is prob hundreds of meters/few km away. They can barely shoot.
Its very odd that he's almost begging the US for more funding for Israel. Almost like his life is in the hands of Israel and if he doesnt say his lines he'll be deported.
Cope Level: Ghosts????
That first shot had D-Day landing photo vibes.
Yeah, we're brainwashed biiiggtiiimme.. no jokes aside, hamas crossed the border, killing and kidnapping innocent women and children, that's what kicked this up this time Israel proceeds to tell gaza citizens many times to go south so they can take care of hamas for what they did.. I feel bad for the civilians on both sides.. idk how this will end for either side. People are going to either have to leave to safety, stay and defend, or risk your life and possibly become collateral damage when they are shooting rockets or guns from say a neighbors house or whatever location, maybe a rocket malfunctions in Gaza/Israel  and takes civilian lives.. It's just a shitty situation either way

True Biden is too weak and lifts all sanctions on Iran to sell oil, giving them money even though they hate us. Trump had them quite Middle East was doing good tell Biden took over 2 wars economy is shit border wide open for terrorist Biden has to go are were doomed.
I can‚Äôt recall when the IDF entered Afghanistan and Iraq! They did well against Syria though
From the looks of things Gaza is gonna resemble Bakhmut by the time this is over.
Please do your part in whatever ways you can. Don't just support the Palestinian cause, be a part of it.
This is the greatest caption I‚Äôve ever seen in my life LOL
From the point of the video maybe?
to pose for pictures, maybe?
It's crazy how this isn't being covered on CNN, BBC and Sky. They are still positioning this as Israel defending itself. Hardly any reporting on Palestine casualties.
i've never seen anyone blow himself so much!
1999 apartment bombings (I assume he's referring to that)
I know right, all religions are dumb as fuck
Lmaooo at thats the police's job
Israel is regional bulwark. It was designed as such by the British and it serves the same purpose for the US. For example, one of - if not the - largest overseas US naval bases is in the gulf island nation of Bahrain. The US isn't pillaging their oil, but as with all their regional bases, it was and is a vital staging point for US hegemony. Its also a place where a lot of active duty personnel are sent on their downtime. These people are constantly being rotated.
Did they survive
If they used a tank or bombs it doesn't count I guess.
Against top attack ATGMs, no. Against gravity dropped munitions from a drone probably, if they are small grenades or potentially RPG rounds. However there is also the factor of people throwing shit on top of you as you drive through a city, so it's not all about the armor, it's also about crew safety.
Settlers is such a sanitized word for this thievery.
&gt;Someone dropping Adam Sandler movies on their opponents to cause severe mental retardationok, the whole murdering civilians and gutting babies was one thing, but this?
Over 400 of those "defenceless" men and women were IDF, another 60 were officers. Of the *8000* dead Palestinians, there has been no evidence that any of them had ties to Hamas. 3100 of them were KIDS. BABIES. Israel has killed twice as many children as Hamas killed all ages combined. Northern Gaza has had to cancel the school year because Israel has MURDERED all of the school children.You act as if this entire thing started on October 7th. Israel has been slaughtering Palestinians for DECADES. Since they were *given* Palestinian land by the British Government. They are an oppressive occupying force who murders the civilians living in what remains of Palestine, which are just open air prisons. Try to educate yourself about this shit from beyond this month.
They work for low yield munitions like fpv suicide drones and rpgs. But against anything larger, it‚Äôs useless
Should all be charged with attempted murder
Decent Machines.
Do cope cages actually work? Genuine question because I don't know the actual name for it.
The footage IDF releases is worse than the $200 drone footage from Ukraine
No phonk music, are Israelis even trying?
I believe this is a repost from the '80s.
That's the whole philosophical question. One of Hamas goal is to eliminate the Israelis state, not to protect the Palestinian populace. What can Israel do? Both people lay claim to the territory and both will never forfeit it.   Heck, If I had it my way, You would give the Israelis a Plot of land across the world and do the Same with the Palestinians. Afterwards, once you've taken all relics out of the region, you Nuke it and make it unhabitable for centuries to come. However, this is also not a real possibility. :\\
Not IDF.  These are not ‚Äúdefensive‚Äù forces.  They are occupying forces, IOF. Nothing about this is defensive
He asked a bunch of tourists why they aren‚Äôt upset about the racism at the bus stop‚Ä¶why would they be aware of that policy if they don‚Äôt live there? I‚Äôm surprised the soldiers didn‚Äôt just tell him it was because they kept bombing the buses but I guess they just didn‚Äôt want to engage with the guy calling them racists.
Well... Whatever happened after they caught him, he learned a valuable lesson about commitment.
I'm sorry you have to feel that way but I get it
I'd rather be IDF than a Palestinian child. Less chance of being killed
He parroting a lot points which are a repetition of what US and Israel has to say about the parallels between Hamas and ISIS.I also get the feeling that this interview has more to do with feeding the narrative of the justification for the relentless bombardment of Gaza. Not much was said about the circumstances under which hamas came to existence in the first place
I'll go with the term "attempted murder"
Someone on the Internet said something, so it MUST BE TRUE. üôÑ
Palestinians who forcefully entered the land of Israel and kicked the Israelis out of their houses, and their reason is worse than their crime "if we don't steal your houses, someone else would". Man those Palestinians are disgusting. Not to mention how many children they've killed, but the US just continue to supply them with the best equipment, while the poor Israelis have no water, no food, no internet, no nothing. While the Palestinians celebrate the death of children, [here, see for yourself.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?embeds_referring_euri=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.timesofisrael.com%2F&amp;source_ve_path=MTY0OTksMjg2NjQsMTY0NTAz&amp;feature=emb_share&amp;v=h7qFACSfd_k) Also yesterday those Palestinians were using a [tank to bomb poor Israelis trying to run](https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/s/KoD7JiRd48). IIRC that's a warcrime. But Palestinians were committing war crimes ever since their occupation started 70 years ago. Like for example recently they [killed 3k children](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/3-000-children-in-gaza-killed-by-israel-since-oct-7-palestines-un-envoy/3033715), and they're claiming it's minor side damages. Absolutely disgusting.Free Israel from the occupation!!!!!Lmao
One group are throwing rocks, the other are raining down missiles on innocent civilians.
I read this as pizza fight. I wish it was a pizza fight.
so every building in Gaza can have possible Hamas terrorists, you cant assume its all civilians, by your logic
Man getting a free beer when I see him.
Yea, about that.... [The crater is facing the wrong direction for it to have come from behind the hospital](https://twitter.com/ForensicArchi/status/1715422493274427414/photo/1)
These ladies are gonna be soooo embarrassed when they go to their accounting jobs tomorrow.
I think he said 'Tehri Paandi' something .....
You mean when it actually was a missile from Israel?  Sure *Israel* said it was Hamas accidentally bombing the hospital, but when it was analyzed by numerous third parties, they all found that the missile came from Israel. https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/20/what-have-open-source-videos-revealed-about-the-gaza-hospital-explosionhttps://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67216929
The team wouldn‚Äôt need to kick him off. Whatever organization ran the league would ban him and most likely press charges against him.
Does anyone remember that video of the ghostly gremlin climbing on the Abrams tank from like 10 years ago
Well, that didn't cross my mind. GJ looking that up.
It‚Äôs not that we don‚Äôt blame Hamas. It‚Äôs that it doesn‚Äôt matter at this point, Israel is not acting in self-defense Israel is acting with vengeance. We are anti-killing a bunch of Palestinian kids. I don‚Äôt really think that I‚Äôve seen a single person in this sub specifically saying that what Hamas did was right. We all know and understand that the attack that they did was fucked up and not OK. That doesn‚Äôt excuse Israel‚Äôs war crimes and ethnic cleansing of the Palestinian People. We are also all smart enough to know that the Israeli government has spent decades oppressing and brutalizing Palestinians.Just as Jewish doesn‚Äôt mean Israeli, Palestinian doesn‚Äôt mean Hamas. We support the Palestinian people and framing it like we are pro terrorist is kind of gross all it does is show that you came here in bad faith. Do you want people to discuss this with you but why would they? Why would people want to discuss what this guy is saying with you when you‚Äôre here telling us that we are less anti Hamas than we are anti Israel?
This guy is a compassionate individual.  It‚Äôs sickening how no one really gave a shit.  Explains how the genocide going on right now is a thing.
Showing videos of Israel bombing hospitals isn't necessarily "pro Palestine."  It's just showing what's going on over there. However banning videos of Israel doing these things is definitely pro Israel.  They don't want people to know of the atrocities committed. That being said, I think most people in this subreddit are "pro people" regardless of what side of that imaginary line they were born on.  Nobody here wants to see civilians, Israeli or Palestinian, getting killed.  The problem is that it's VERY lop-sided.  Israel is killing like 5 times the amount of people Hamas is while leveling entire neighborhoods and targeting hospitals like this, so of course we're getting mad at Israel way more often than at Hamas.
Yeah, no big deal. Just throw em back with 'guided' rocket into civilian populated areas, hospitals, and place of worship where supposedly terrorist are hiding. Who cares about collateral damages, they die a martyr anyway, so definitely not civilian. Those are 'inevitable' and 'expected' damages if someone say so, and you must believe it without questioning. Who cares if it's numbing your sanity? For real, who cares?
That RPG did not fire... the rocket is still in the tube, he even takes it out at the end of the video.Looks like whatever shot it was offscreen but it wasn't the guy kneeling in centre frame. Edit - looks like theres a puff of smoke to the right when it fires

I am still wondering about where they found gas for two cars when even hospitals are dry...
The problem is this ideology has been programmed as part of the daily experience of living in Israel. Israel is a Jewish state where any jew from any other part of the world can claim the citizenship under the ‚Äúright to return‚Äù law, while the Palestinians have no claim.  Israel needs the exclusivity and Apartheid mindset to alienate half the people, which will inevitably result in such a mindset.

said the children killersüóø
Okay Hasbara. Really loading up the terms there to refer to 1.something million women and children.
No the justification is they already told people to evacuate the northern part of gaza. The citizens of gaza know the IDF is launching a ground invasion to eradicate Hamas. Any civilian stupid enough to be outside during a ground invasion is risking their lives and the lives of their family (if the camera man is even to be believed). Where are they driving to? They had several days to evacuate if they wished to evacuate. If you can‚Äôt evacuate for some reason then just stay in your home. For all the tank commander knows that car could be a VBIED. There could be Hamas fighters in there who are turning around after seeing a tank. It‚Äôs an invasion and the civilians were already given plenty of notice.
‚ÄúIDF‚Äù what, the office worker trying to go to work, a van that very well could have children inside and a random person on a motorcycle??
Head over there. See if you enjoy being potential IDF
Gross
you have to understand, a major part of western propaganda is that they have the "freest press on earth" and every country they bomb is totally isolated and brainwashed by a multi-ethnic multi-religious international coalition of zombie Hitlers. So anyone that disagrees with US foreign policy has in fact never once heard the pro-US argument, in this case pro-Israel. OP in this case literally thinks nobody here has ever heard a bad word about Hamas/refuses to listen to any criticism of them.Another example is that Americans when visiting China will often be very vocal about Tiananmen  square as they believe it is the most censored cover up in world history. When they learn that not only have most Chinese heard of it but it doesn't make them want to revolt against the chinse government and convert to white christian capitalism, they are shocked and appear dazed and disoriented
He has a very creepy smile
Yup. This is Strawberry Hill cinema parking lot behaviour.
Ask him.
Nope not mixing it up, understand west bank and gaza very well. Gaza is a concentration camp right next to the west bank, west bank is an illegal settlement chalk full of colonizers/terrorists, that murdered tons of innocent Palestinians women and children, stole there homes and "settled there"...Apartheid is thickest in the west bank but is all over Israel. Even a Jew from New York even went to west bank to get in on colonization action. He murdered a family to take their home and then proceeded to shoot up a mosque during ramadan. Which was a jump off point for a lot of things that happened in the beginning of the illegal colonization and "settling"Do you know what the naqba is?

Possible IDF members therefore legitimate targets
The USA did nothing in world war II. The USA only joined in the last year of the war only and only thing that they did was bomb Japan with a nuke after the war was already over murdering over 200,000 innocent civilians. That's the USA's part in world war 2. USA did fucking nothing. You obviously don't know dick about history. You're obviously a retard! Lmaoooo!
Hamas is not a country. Gaza is not a country. There is no Palestinian country. Therein lies the problem.
It's seriously painful. I suspect a lot of it is extremely bad faith, but I do think there are a lot of Americans in particular who hear absolutely nothing about the conflict until Israel is oh so regrettably and tragically forced to "defend itself"
Bot bot bot. Hey I love kids, PA kids included. Hamas started this and needs to give the hostages back or more people in Gaza die when Israel rightfully tries to retrieve their people from the hands of legitimate PA terrorists.
How many Israeli children have been bombed? Read just some of the list. You  Israel bot.

And wether we realise it or not‚Ä¶ we harbour some of our folks beliefs. It‚Äôs disheartening. It‚Äôs true. You are correct. Australia has some racist tendencies. I‚Äôm glad that‚Äôs out of the way.

Gooseses will roam the continent bringing order and obedience to the wayward colonies.  Mooseses will be held in reserve in the great white north as the strategic reserve of Upper / Greater Canada.  We are already larger than the lost colonies after all.Sorry.
Your obviously blind. Muslims are far more harassed than the Jewish community, and in particular in America post 9/11 (I'm an American so can only speak on the differences in treatment here between the groups). In America Muslim are demonized, while Jews own all the banks, all the media, and all of Hollywood. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èAre you that dumb? Gaza is a concentration camp, the zionist nazi regime controls all the roads all the sea and all the airspace in and around Gaza. The ppl there are prisoners to the Zionist Nazi Jew regime. It's an Apartheid state so Palestine can't travel the roads, can't shop at stores or get access to any of the materials needed to build the water supply, the nazi Jew zionist also won't allow permits for the buildings, if the Palestinians disobey and build they will be shot on the spot. They aren't allowed to fish in therw ocean for food or they will be shot. Tell me this mister genius, how to you build a water supply when in a prison with no materials and you aren't allowed to leave the prison to get the material, travel the roads to bring in the resources in, or get the permit to commence buliding without being murdered...riddle me that, ya nazi sympatherizerü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è100s of billions???

WRONG!!! LMAO! Jews have what they have because america gave it to them, funded it, and protects it. Isreal is really America, without us Americans, isreal will cease to exist overnight. Why? Because Nazi isrealis don't have the ability, gumption, or know how or heart to build there state by themselves. they had to suck American cock and beg us to fund it, build it, and continuously protect it for themü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I'm not trying to discredit anyone, I just thought it was a funny story
Not under any circumstances defending Hamas but they simply haven't had the same level of practice. We don't want to give them time to do so.
His words, not mine. It's a direct quote. Go to 4:40 in the video. Ask that of him.

I'm talking about the intention. Israel takes measures to avoid civilian deaths. Hamas seeks to maximize them.

So for Russia in WW2 your ignoring the land-lease act? All the USA weapons? Your drinking the Kremlins cool-aid as well.I'd love to see your sources for people in Israel teaching Palastines are rats. Enlightened me please.
After turning in his own father he came to the US to become a citizen and they arrested him and tried to deport him for being in Hamas, so another spy had to reveal his identity just to vouch for him. The fact that he had published a  book detailing his work as an Israeli spy and might be executed if deported to Palestine, was not good enough.
Are you okay?
I know this sub is more passionate about blaming Israel than Hamas, but let's at least try to have this discussion. If you disagree, please argue with facts so others can get the point you are trying to make.
Interwar conflicts are some of my favs. Saw more tanks and planes than WW1 but not the massive mobility of WW2, nor the sheer scale of fighting of either. Kinda of a cool era imo.
Not Canadians
IMO anyone kicking or hitting someone down that can‚Äôt intelligently defend themselves should be charge with attempted murder. If they are unconscious and then someone hits or kicks they should get the max for attempted murder
Right? It's like they've picked up a novel at page 374 and think they know what the book is about.
Sorry if you misunderstood! My English needed fixing. Is anything wrong?
This is the NCD I was warned about üò®
Thank God I'm not the only one who hates both countries equally because both are terrorists It's just sad that the citizens of both countries are dying
It's crazy some people will still say things like this. Some Redditor was so sure that all these videos are just  A.i generated
Local Police Spetsnaz not Alpha Group or Military Spetsnaz.
Laughable. You never served a day. Dueces.
No, they used aerosolized fentanyl in the moscow theater siege. Many of the civilians who died, died because the rescue workers transported the victims on their backs so they choked on their vomit or their own tounges. The craziest thing to me is that they knocked all of the terrorists with the gas, and then they shot them while unconscious. Like, they didn't even consider interrogating them
You think calling people names is having a conversation? Is English your second language or just manners are?
You ever seen the makeup of the idf. Been watching all day the idf soldiers harassing women and children. The idf is composed of half women that's first off, and the men are just exceptionally small skinny week feeble. cowards wh are citizens who were forced to join idf to do the bidding of the nazi Israel regime. With out America and American weapons, most idf "soldiers" would get smashed by an average American female ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è...if America stopped supporting naziism, yes, I could definitely say, in hand to hand combat, I would destroy every idf female "soldier" and 99% of the cowards skinny weak feeble males ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
Where's the rest of the video?
Israel is the victim
Where the fk is Brampton?
You know if 18 out of 193 vote in favour that's a minority and doesn't represent anything, less than 10% of the countries, and which countries are they the Arab countries who think Israel should exist and Jews should die? The countries which kill millions of their own citizens? Which countries? Put up the image of the votes in the UN and let's go one by one on the list, what do you say?
Thanks for the explanation
What are talking about, do you have a brain??? No he wasn't hauling around nazi's...the point of my Moses comment was to highlight the euro Jew aren't even true Jews, do you know about the original 12 tribes, prob notü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è...the sheer lack analytic ability of some ppls minds blows me away ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Israel, either of two political units in the Hebrew Bible (Old Testament): the united kingdom of Israel under the kings Saul, David, and Solomon, which lasted from about 1020 to 922 bce; or the northern kingdom of Israel, including the territories of the 10 northern tribes (i.e., all except Judah and part of Benjamin), ...
Nice to see a few clips actual people being targeted.

And I‚Äôm going to say that the people with 7 wives that are like 14 aren‚Äôt going down a righteous path. They voted Hamas in. And hamas is sealing their fate
You gearing up to fight the IDF? Thought so. Go away keyboard warrior.
Dunno, it's a fuckin science mystery that no one can figure out
Naw, the word nazi isn't thrown around in America. Now the term racist is, and doesn't really hold meaning anymore due to woke culture. Love how you slurping the semen of nazi isreal leadership is turned into me cucking for Hamas lmao!really it's just called the truth, something the Jew diaspora isn't really good at. Just look at the Jew controlled media in America which controls a global narrative, no truth at all there ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è...true history is never told by the victor, you prob still believe Columbus found America! ü§£ü§£ü§£
How is pointing out killing kids sympathizing with terrorists? Wtf, are u all brainwashed? When Hamas kills kids all world must mourn , but if someone points out Israel killing kids as well it's sympathizing with terrorists. GTFO
Those straws 'mate' are all the post referendum media articles talking about how the yes vote failed. guess who they essentially blamed it on? I'll give you a hint:  The Immigrants. Cliched af right? Don't get me wrong, I love Australia, but it is important to acknowledge there are still very broken things in our own society before we go racing around the world trying to tell others how to manage their societies.
And you just sound like a whiny chick. Omggg they‚Äôre nazis omg they killed civilians that were using their homes to harbor terrorist after they had their own civilians slaughtered by said righteous Palestinians
Oops I got the order wrong. And no you only have a few things correct. But if the Jews were the people of Moses. Who was a prophet of god. Then I highly doubt he was hauling around nazis while splitting the sea in two. It sounds like your head is split in two
I think they do, unless they are citizen. Canadian immigration office can kick them out if anyone commit crime while holding PR in Canada.
Napoleon was way after the Romans, youre retarded ü§£...omg, you don't even know what you're talking about! ü§£ü§£ü§£ Wrong, the 1st Jews were the ppl of Moses, Africans, whom were supposedly enslaved by pharoh. So you don't even know that the Jew in isreal now (anishkenazi ) are fake European cos players who were illegally giving me land by the UN and then turned that land into the nazi Germany, the very place that almost eradicated them. It's pathetic, embarrassing, weak and feeble!
I am so glad i am not the only one feeling this way. I feel like my reality is so warped and twisted now. This all feels so‚Ä¶ dystopian. I watch Biden speak and i am just baffled.  I watch Israeli officials speak‚Ä¶ baffled. I watch countless people get accosted for just suggesting maybe dont starve and carpet bomb a bunch of civilians (Palestinian or otherwise), as if its a radical idea‚Ä¶ feels like a black mirror episode, like you said. Humans are really this ruthless?? I really didn‚Äôt understand how bad it was, my last bit of faith in humanity in hanging by a thread
He clearly needs to read up on it like that guy in the video.
No child should experience this. Smh
You people thow the Nazi term around so much its diluded and means nothing anymore. You're a useful idiot like many others here stateside cucking for Hamas.
Hate to see this shit, and fuck wore to see any innocent civilians get hurt for fucking any reason or purpose. But I must say Isreal behavior led to this shit. Simply try to walk in Jerusalem as a Christian - you will get hell treatment. Every time whatever I travel and if there are Jews on the plane, they always show no respect to anybody. I lost respect for Jews a long time ago, entirely because of their behavior toward others.Every Action has a Consequence!
In my experience, this sub always had a kind of political tone. For example, during the black life matters protests this was also always upvoted content, and a clear narrative / side that was supported by this sub.

That sucks about your landlord. It must suck even more that Israel turned into a nazi country with nazi policy and rule of the land. And What koolaid? The koolaid that zionist nazi Jews are innocent good ppl? Tell that to the 18 UN nations that have condemned and convicted nazi isreal of war crimes against humanity. The entire world now sees what Israel has turned into since being recognized as a state by the UN. it's a nazi run hot bed of terrorist zionists. You can't apply your ant-semitism claims to the truth. ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
That looked like a fifth of cooking oil in dude's hand
you realise that a little bit less than half the population supported the yes vote? its not the majority but it's still a significant portion. and who's to say this guy didn't support the yes vote? you're grasping at straws, mate.
They are not, sadly Hamas uses them as human shields in order to film on camera to have people like you sympathize with them
Don‚Äôt forget the rape. They also rape these families before massacring them.
Who's occupying who here?
Dude that's wild
I think fight is a little bit of a stretch. Stomping a guys head that‚Äôs already KO‚Äôd should be called something else.
Whenever I watch a video like this, it only confirms my suspicion that humanity is a problem that only a meteor can solve.
Different sensibilities. Move on.
The same thing has been going on in Surrey, BC.
Oh The irony, Aussies just voted to not give their indigenous peoples a representative voice in parliament.  "do you like racism?" lmao.
I mean, people say that all the time.Eventually you have to say no to the expense.That said, if you have to live next to bloodthirsty neighbors, a missile defense system seems like the least you could do.
I served 4 years in Germany. My landlord had a Nazi room in his house dedicated to Hitler. I had to sit in that room monthly to pay my rent, he wouldn't let me put in the mailbox, and being lectured about the benefits of the 3rd Reich. Everybody was fed, everyone was happy and had jobs bs. Couldn't mention the final solution. I actually knew a Nazi that lived during that time. Not interested in your take. Flush your headgear and stop drinking the kool-aid.
According to the mods, new accounts' comments are automatically removed to prevent bots and people making new accounts to support their cause.Which is good tbh. You still have comments siding with Palestine and others siding with the occupiers. So the mods aren't taking sides.
Would I be correct in assuming that you have never said "maybe that building was full of hamas, you can't assume" after an Israeli missile strike?
One of the great tragedies is the U.S. support of Israel. It makes me sick to think my tax money is being spent slaughtering civilians. Israel needs u.s. support more than u.s. needs Israel as a strategic partner. Support should be conditional on a two state solution.
That's the very reason this zionist nazi regime is such trash, they literally transformed into the very people that almost wiped them off the face of the planet. Just look at what actual Jewish citizens are really saying, the ones who've been rioting in the streets (over 50%) to rid the government of the Zionist Nazi regime. Many rabbis and Israeli reporters alike who have boots on the ground have been condemning the netanyahu, Fascist right wing Nazi regime. You obviously have no idea about history, because it was Russia at the battle of stalingrad that saved the entire world from Nazis, genius! ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.  Just listen to what zionists say about Palestinians. They're called rats and they are taught and are teaching kids starting elementary school that Palestinians are rats and not people. It's the exact same rhetoric and the exact same motions that the Nazis used against Jews and world war II and now zionists Nazis are now inacting the same constructs against Palestinians. It's embarrassing and is ridiculous. Zionist nazis should just kill themselves right now and the entire world would a better place. Exactly like what happened when Nazis were defeated ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

For most Americans, this conflict began on October 7. Probably no idea Israeli soldiers were gunning down unarmed protestors in 2019. The IDF spends most of its time fighting civilians. It's why they were barely effective in the 2009 war.

I'm not Palestinian, I didn't vote for anything, I'm American. A 3rd party that fought nazi's knows exactly what Nazism is, and refuse to find it with my hard earned tax dollars.Also, stop with the Jew lies, the ENTIRE world now knows and is on to the zionist nazi regime. The majority of Israelis themselves despise the current Zionist regime and netanyahu. There have been raised in the streets every day prior to the current altercation happening in order to get their fascist right wing Nazi government out of Israel. That is known as well documented and it's been on the news and media everyday prior to these events. Why is there rioting? Because the majority of Jewish folks in Israel know they belong to an apartheid nazi slaver state and they've been murdering innocent civilians for more than two decades now. The vast majority of Israeli Jews who are not zionists or tired of it and want it to end now as well. But the extremist Zionist portion of Israel which you seem to be the same as the KKK in America is the same as isis and the Taliban in Afghanistan and in Syria. Zionists are a terrorist group who have been owning and operating the largest concentration camp humanity is ever seen with impunity and with the backing of American dollars and the American military. Without America, Israel is weak and feeble and would be crushed in less than a day.And the whole thing of Palestine declining statehood. That's a misnomer by the Zionist, not sea regime. Palestinians didn't decline statehood. They decline to be slaves, declined apartheid and declined to live in a concentration camp which is exactly what the zionist Jew Nazi regime did anyway. Zionism is the new naziism and needs be eradicated from planet Earth! ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
If they help Palestinians the US will annihilate everything and anything they send. Good luck have fun, sucks to suck
I didn't say I agree with her words (I'll say now that I do). Her words are hardly dubious. They reflect what many Israelis have said on record since this this recent series of atrocities broke out. Hostages have a right to express themselves however they see necessary. I'm not here to support any legal argument. I just want these hostages and all the other innocent inhabitants of Gaza to survive and somehow continue their lives.

OUR future
A Gazan woman said she paid $45 for a bag of flour that came in the aid trucks. A bag of flour that is normally $12. Why is aid not being given to them? Why are they paying exorbitant prices for food that was meant to aid them?
The Hamas charter literally makes an explicit call for genocide of the jews.Only brain dead shitstains can't see that both parties in this conflict are morally condemnable.
It's so frustrating not being able to actually do something against this abuse.
This guy is a godamn hero
It's our strength!
Depends on who you ask
the car was trying to turn around when it saw the tank so that rules it out as being a suicide bomber.as for why it was being recorded, the recorders are local journalists, and they met the car before it went to where the Israeli tank was, and that's why they know there was a family inside.it's not OP who made the remarks about being a family inside the car, but the journalist who was recording did so in the video.
Israel is actually 3000 + years old. And thier land was only given back after the holocaust. Nepoleon took it first, then the Roman‚Äôs took it again, then the Ottoman Empire took it. So I‚Äôm going to ask you to stop spreading fake bullshit that sounds good to you.
Where are your Jews? Where are the Jews of 14 Arab nations that used to live there? Why are there 0 Jews in most Arab nations?How many Muslims live in Israel? How many of them hold jobs of doctors, judges, government representatives including MPs in the Knesset?Is the attack of Jew currently globally really related to Gaza? Killings in Russia, marking Jew houses and business in Europe like in the Nazi rule. Even in the US students need to lock themselves in from the crowd. Where else are Muslims harassed like that?You have 0 response for all the resources that came in to build Gaza up. 100s of Billions of dollars for a small area.Why is Gaza not self sufficient with water? After all the investment to make it as such..You just have hate for Jews and for Females so sad you don't get compassionate education that appropriates all life not just the ones you look up to.
How exactly are the Palestinian kids connected to festival killing?
Hamas is making rockets in the hospital that‚Äôs why everybody there has cancer!
I have seen it from pro, anti and neutral sources. Many videos have been recycled from other conflicts, im not for war but the anti isreal lies are out of control, im not some liberal hive mind and you say its text book but all the evidence from past genocides isnt there. 5000 people in a super crowded place after heavy bombing, thats standard no frills war.
No shit. You had no clue they were in Israel. That‚Äôs what you said. Your comment and response seems like something only a dipshit would say.
You can take the villager out of the village but not the village out of the villager.
Probably just like when they targeted the other hospital the other day with 500 killed according to Hama... Ehh I mean Gaza Health Ministry. ü§°But seriously, the real enemy of Gaza are the radical Islamist terrorist dictators that "govern" Gaza and decided to attack civilians of a much stronger neighbour, while knowing that there will be revenge and their own people will suffer.
Yup!! I can't believe Israel stormed over the border to kill and kidnap civilians in the area and then do the same damn thing at the festival! Oh.. yeah... I forgot that wasn't Israel my bad...
While the majoirty of Palestinians feel that way, the group that currently runs Gaza, Hamas, wants Israel completely whiped off the map. So long as Hamas exists there cannot be a two state solution. I disagree with Israel's current strategy, but also understand how they can't let Hamas continue to exist.
Hey OP. Massive respect for spreading the word on what's going on in Palestine!! Keep doing what you're doing!!
They hated red dude
Whiteness is always relative, Irish and Italians used to not be considered white. Painting all of Israel as white is dumb, but I'd say a majority of the genocidal Zionists i've seen are pretty white. I'm shamed to be from the same city as Netanyahu.
They didn't, that was Hamas that kidnapped 200+ innocent isreali citizens. But that was after the zionist nazi isreali regime kidnapped over 1,000,000 Palestinians blew up there home that the loved in for generations then forced them into the Gaza strip concentration camp..so there that. If you're that butt hurt about 200 civilians, how should Palestine feel about over 1,000,000 Palestinians??? You're one of the coward nazi zionist skinny half men poontangs aren't ya? Lamoooo!
This video makes a cut but in the full video you see that one guy survived the rpg, he gets out and tries to flee but gets shot - you can see him dead on the ground at the end of the clip. They also shoot a motorcyclist coming down the road that you see dead in the top left at the end of the video.
Taking civilian hostages is always wrong. Israel has similarly been holding hundreds of Palestinians in indefinite detention to leverage their occupation. All hostages should be freed unconditionally. But I have no faith that Israel would negotiate in good faith because they never have.
hope HAMAS sees this!
Fucking stupid you're the nazi with this antisemitic post you'd fell and hit your head on something üôÑ
You're really saying that just because the kill count is small, it's fake? Have you seen videos and other journalist footage in Gaza? If you haven't, I advice you to check them out and educate yourself on what's happening. Israel is committing textbook genocide infront of everyone.

&gt;Well, now that I think about it, the IDF does have a history of shooting kids for throwing rocks so maybe that's the distinction you're referring to.I agree, the IDF have shot so many kids, elderly as well, they love that shit.
What resources are the US &amp; the UK ‚Äúraping‚Äù and ‚Äúpillaging‚Äù from Israel/Palestine?

&gt; Lampshade Hanging (or, more informally, "Lampshading") is the writers' trick of dealing with any element of the story that seems too dubious to take at face value, by calling attention to it and simply moving on.Also applicable to analogous rhetorical techniques, like recognizing a person is under duress then calling her words sincere just because you agree with them and want them to be sincere. That‚Äôs a dubious and ridiculous claim on your part. Statements made under duress are inherently unreliable as being sincere, that‚Äôs kind of the whole issue with statements made under duress, they can‚Äôt be taken at face value. That‚Äôs why anything said under duress holds no legal weight like for a will or contract. If you want to support an argument using those other sources then good, do so. But to bolster it with the words of someone being held hostage in a video released by her captors is not only irrational but it‚Äôs pretty horrid and sick.
It wasn‚Äôt, this video makes a cut but in the full video you see one civilian survived and he gets shot when trying to flee (you can see him dead on the ground at the end). Also there‚Äôs a motorcyclist that gets shot in the top left.
That ending
they're only used to fighting children throwing rocks
Nope I'm not a Hamas supporter, they are terrorists, I don't support terrorism like I don't support genocide. I do think Egypt needs to help the Palestinians (that might mean go to war with Israel), and no, 7 countries went on an offensive and lost to America not to Israel. Israel only exist on the hard earned tax dollars of working middle class American citizens and the IP of America industrial war complex. Isreali citizens, the Zionist portion to be exact are cowards, skinny little half men who rely on the masculine Americans to save them from the beasts of the Middle East. Your out of your mind, and spewing isreali lies, zionist islrealis are ousted and everyone now knows they are nazis. infrastructure is not allowed to be built in Gaza by the naza isreal regime. Apartheid was implemented decades ago and Palestinian can't travel roads, bring in supplies to build infrastructure, bring in aid, get water, or even electricity to operate the tools to build the infrastructure, they even fish there own ocean because Nazi Israel controls the land sea and air of Gaza. It's a litteral open air prison that zionist isrealis send civilian Palestinians to die, same as Nazis did in Germany to the Jews. Again, Hamas has not done any good for Gaza or Palestine, and is a terrorist group, but they were created as a byproduct of Israeli Nazism! If Israel didn't turn to Nazism Hamas wouldve never existed, same as how America created isis with there terrorism of the Middle East. The only way this conflict ends is if the non Zionist Jews that have been rioting in the streets to get netanyahu and his nazi cronies out of power win. That or iran/Saudi Arabia and the Middle East powers put the idf in there place. Let them know they are a weak female army of 40% women who's only real power is America's backing, with out America, Israel as it is now, dies in less than a day ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Under Arab rule, Jews, Christians, and Muslims lived there in relative peace. That peace was interrupted in 1947. In Jew rule, isreal, turned into nazi Israel, an apartheid slavery state where brain washing begins in kindergarten that Palestine is just rats and should die, same as what Nazis did to the Jewish ppl in WW2. Zionist isreali in essence, copied there oppressors and did the same thing to the true inhabitants of the west bank/regions of the...wait for it... PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES. which is how every map in the world was labeled prior to 1947. So just stop being a nazi, and stop supporting Nazism, apartheid and slavery, and the region will stabilize, simple as that!
Consider that the settlements are globally recognized as illegal. If the Palestinians were to launch an attack to retake the settlements, that would be acceptable. If they captured the settlements and closed off the area to fight off the IDF, that would be acceptable. Israel would be in the position of trying to retake the settlements while being restrained by not knowing where the terrorists were and where the settlers were. Instead of a lengthy door to door guerilla war that could take weeks, they were done in a day. Instead of Israel being dragged into a street fight with minimal civilian casualties, the IDF, as per Israeli papers decided to make 'tough choices', level the settlements with Hamas and settlers inside, and put the blame entirely on Hamas. This is the same logic being used to murder civilians in Gaza. We are bombing, but it is your fault for making us do it. And most US media is happy to repeat this even though it is blatantly contrary to the Geneva convention.
New temporary canadians
yeah took me a few replays to see there was someone else firing it
Yes, shortly after she declared "You deserve death!"
He‚Äôs fucked
I cant say for sure but i don't buy it. Look at the rwandan genocide, that was done just with machetes and isreal is rediculously armed, the numbers though do match up with the casualties of typical urban warfare. U.s killed a million iraqis, 200000 afganis, and with hamas using hospitals and schools as bases, the numbers seem standard to me.
Nothing says tough guys like swarming and kicking people when they are down

Fu c k ing insane. How sad.
Cause it's a caravan of military vehicles and any group of stopped vehicles could be a road side bomb in their path so the bulldozer hits debris and sets off any traps while protecting the caravan behind it. Stopping for any length of time outside a safe area in a war zone could also result in being put at a disadvantage if they were ambushed.
Woah. I've been trying to parse the truth of this conflict through multiple independent news sources but some how I missed this. It's consistent with IDF's Hannibal Doctrine. &gt;  If instead the hostages were all killed in the cross fire, that would be an acceptable sacrifice.and they could blame it on the October 7 Palestinian incursion.
...Yeah!... How dare Israel force Hamas to cross the border to fucking kill and kidnap civilians! Then Israel proceeded to obliterate gazas hospital completely into a brick parking lot, killing HUNDREDS!!.. Blast was so big that it made the hospitals structure disappear and just left cars burnt.. there technology to do that is mind-boggling
Had Ukraine invaded Russia and gone on a murderous rampage for no tactical advantage knowing this would be the result, then your analogy might have some validity.
Unbelievable. It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶. Can‚Äôt do anything about it, why worry? Respect to her and hope she continues to stay safe.
Civi's are dying stuck in a fight between government ment and terrorism and we choose to spend our time fighting each other. Damn this planet.
Would it be different it they were "armed"??? Well, now that I think about it, the IDF does have a history of shooting kids for throwing rocks so maybe that's the distinction you're referring to.
Just like America. No backies tho
They just train at a similar length to any other Western army...
Everything she says is corroborated by multiple other Israelis interviewed by multiple other news sources. Definitely under duress but by no means insincere, by no means inherently unreliable. She's testimony to Israel's actions and inactions like many others: Yosheved Lifshitz, Yasmin Porat, etc.(Sorry, I don't understand what it means to "lampshade" something.)
Hamas is intentionally targeting civilians with plans found on them to target youth centers and schools to slaughter and kill men woman and children.  Israel on the other hand is hitting civilians, not because their targeting them, but because Hamas is putting military assets in residential areas and next to schools, hospitals and even the UN buildings in the hopes Israel will hit them during their retaliation to say look how horrible they are all while they hide like cowards in tunnels. Intentions are important. I sympathize for the innocent people in Gaza who want nothing to do with this but it's Hamas who invited this response and are using the people who live there are shields hence why they won't allow them to leave because it weakens their position.
That‚Äôs so wrong üòë
Justify what Hamas did on 7th October Palestine people should go to Arab counties, so may options
This shit is getting out if control on both sides. There are peaceful people on both sides wanting to live their lives, not interested in war. This is all very scary for the whole world.
You have to remember your talking about religious zealots who decided god wanted them to leave their house and normal life in the US to go terrorize a family halfway across the world and steal their land. They think god is on their side, and the state of Israel also sees stealing more land as more important than safety of Israeli citizens, or the young IDF members they send to guard these violent settlers. If they were concerned about their citizens safety they wouldn‚Äôt have dropped 6,000+ bombs in Gaza not knowing where the Israeli hostages are.
I would give an award for the nice collection of photos, but they took them away.

Misleading title.
You hear that rocket?  The same sound as the rocket hitting the hospital.  Israel blew up that hospital.  The sound proves it wasn't a failed Hamas rocket falling out of the sky
Damn Isreal and Hamas
Not at all. I‚Äôm more than happy to have fruitful conversation. You‚Äôre just clueless as to the point I‚Äôm making.Using downvotes as a measure to the validity of a point is laughable. Just read the comment and understand the point being made. Basic comprehension skills, mate.
Zionists want to cover up truth
On point
There is no way he could ever be sentenced. He has full support of the public and even strong international support and sentencing him would lead to unrest, large protests and more retaliation attacks.
I mean also this is like... Medium explosions on the 2nd floor. A lot of Gaza is truly cobbled together and probably doesn't have proper foundations so a jdam to the supporting foundations brings the place down. I really don't think a tunnel is causing issues there, they aren't shallow.
There is this cool document called the "Geneva convention" that has references to another document that dictates everything that is a war crime, which includes bombing hospitals and emergency facilities! Fascinating what reading teaches you.
Both sides!
Israel leveling entire blocks of residential areas is absolutely targeting civilians. Just because they claim there may be some Hamas hiding below them and tell people to leave first (knowing they have nowhere else to go) doesn't change anything.  They are indiscriminately bombing entire areas, they provide no specific evidence or intel that shows they know of terrorists being located specifically where these strikes are, and you'd be a fool to believe they have any, you just take them at their word that they were 'targeting' Hamas.

Way before that. 2023 was the deadliest year on record in the West Bank before Oct 7. Trump, US Evangelical groups, and the far right Netanyahu government have emboldened settlers even more than they were before over the last few years. There are Evangelical groups in the US who dump an insane amount of money and resources into expanding settlements and making new ones.
As a Jew, I passionately stand with this man and with Palestine. To be Jewish is not to be a Zionist or Israeli- let us not confuse the two.
Religious people are the wurst
Every single video from Gaza that I've seen, you can hear drones in the air, buzzing overhead.  On top of all the shit these people are dealing with, that constant sound of those drones would drive me fucking crazy.  I don't know how they do it.
You can‚Äôt just lampshade the duress of a hostage. The circumstances of the video make it inherently unreliable no matter how passionate you say she is and no matter how passionate she is about wanting to be saved. Whether the points about Israel‚Äôs actions are valid independent of the video is another matter entirely.
New world order phase 1
Wtf that got do with this vid?
Yep. Hurt people, hurt people.
This is pure terror. Norway has our own correspondent and doctor there. And hamas is not ti be found around civilians everywhere as israel and us states. Every bomb israel drops, every high tec munition, kills so many civilians. Civilians they have been cleansing and torturing for years. Hamas is a result of that, and in comparison they are small. Murdering over 1200 children in six days now. Thats more than Ukraine in 5 months. There is no Internett connectivity for the counterpart no show all the war crimes commited by the israelis. And jews in my country are spreading the truth about israel, the apartheid state. Hamas was their tool to get allowance in the world to do this. And it will not be tolerated. Hope youre all aware of this. If you wanna know how biased the israeli government is about this, look how they responded to U.N statements about the conflict. Look up Amnesty, red cross and talk to refugees. Free the civilians of Palestine and let israel stand for its crimes!
holy moly the bad panning is about to make me have a seizure.
Yeah, those claims were going around a lot... like Russia shot 12 cruise missles, they only got 10 left.. the next day, Russia shot 27 cruise missles, and at this rate, they won't have any, Like come on, you're just feeding into bs and aren't helping Ukraine.. I'm sure they have insider info, but that was nonsense
When Israel "pulled out" of Gaza, it still had a gun to the head of every Palestinian through illegal occupation under international law. Not to mention, since that time, Israel has allowed illegal settlements, and documented case of brutality towards the Palestinians. It's soo dumb when people bring up the disengagement like they gave sovereignty to the Palestinians while caging them up in Gaza and committing war crimes. Complete stupidity.
They shot the guy on the motorcycle at 2:32 in the upper left.
Socks?
She‚Äôs so hot
When you're ripping up donated water pipes to build missiles, they tend to fail accidentally and fall on unintended targets. Especially when you launch them from directly behind the hospital.
So who do you believe? Israel? They‚Äôre not going to tell you how many civilians they‚Äôve killed. Independent journalists have also witnessed many civilian deaths.
they did in like 30 cities and villages on october 7th
You mean the 1948 Arab-Israel war that started when the British left as the Palestinians and surrounding Arab countries won't accept or negotiate any peace plan diving the area, so 7 countries full armies went on the offensive on Israel and lost...So you wouldn't condemn Hamas's actions or charter to kill all the Jews or admit that the votes for party in Gaza does that they say and kill both people in Israel and Gaza. And abuses the population taking over all aid and all help to build civilian infrastructure in favour of their promise of killingShould we continue this discourse? Have you got anything half balances or half educated to say or just spread one sided lies of hate and destruction while asking for pity? Your mixing what happened decades ago with what happens now in one sentence, it doesn't allow for much logical discussion. I would admit there is a blockage on the Gaza strip by two countries, no one cares why Egypt doesn't want to help anymore and stopped turning an eye for all the people and things that passed the borderYou would say nothing bad about everything that was for citizens that Hamas trashed like 100m$ worth of water piping to turn into missiles, all the concrete for building infrastructure that turned into war tunnels, the big greenhouse for food scrapped into metal...Hamas is doing good for Gaza? It's fighting the war of the oppressed? How many people in Gaza did Hamas kill over the years? What good things has Hamas government in Gaza did for the people of Gaza?
Right. Totally makes up for all of the unarmed children machine gunned in their homes.
That car could have been full of IDF, you can‚Äôt assume

Hamas is a local branch of the muslim brotherhood that exists in all suni arabic states. Hamas has won a democratic elections against the PLO, so it represents gaza as much as the israeli government represents israelis.
Do it OP
All I see is three dead bitches.
Me when the ball collector cart drives by at the driving range
Why did Israel fly into Gaza and kidnap their civilians and take those civilians back to Israel?
&gt;Let me repeat myself since you look like you're on the slow side. And you're the one thinking you need to slow down so the other redditor can read it more clearly. Thats not how writting works bud.
Anyone from the GTA in their right mind avoids Brampton or lives there only because they have to. It‚Äôs a fucking cesspool
From what exactly?
Is this about religion again?
I hope the comments there are just bots, I refuse to believe there are actual people who genuinely believe Gaza somehow deserves this
the 'bUt dO yOu condEmn Hummus?' and '40 beheAdEd bAbiEs' parrot
What was hamas expecting to happen for what they did?  Did they think Israel will just take it and do nothing?  Hamas caused what is happening now in Gaza.
*sigh*I forgot that I was still on this sub
Add wings to make it fly
They said they captured the pilots too......
The divine truth --&gt; "The people get the leaders they deserve" still stands factual. Million dollars of aid and still got channeled into making rocket bombs says it all.Fact
üíØ
No, genocide squads come with para gliders nowadays!
because one side is TARGETING civilians. You can kill more civilians and still be more morally justified. War is bad. Maybe when Israel pulled out of gaza they shouldn't have responded by increasing their rocket fire into Israel by 300%. After a couple decades they have taught Israel that concessions only mean more attacks on Israel.
What about the 1000 innocent kids at the music festival the PalestinianPalestinian murder?
Cowards commiting cowardly atrocious acts!
"My ancestors lived here a thousand years ago. Therefore, I'm going to take your house and kill you."
Correct. There are several statements in Israeli newspapers as well that when retaking the settlements, the IDF used Indiscriminate force of missiles and tank shells. Hostages have been historically difficult for Israel as negotiating for them has been costly. If instead the hostages were all killed in the cross fire, that would be an acceptable sacrifice. This is the suspicion of why the bombing has been relentless, even if they know hostages could be killed.
That's not the point, you said the US weren't in the country.
Punjabis think Brampton is their own village lmao.
No shit. That doesn't mean we're fucking marching troops into Palestine.
Preemptively locking this thread for the collective mental health of NCD.
The US is in Israel https://theintercept.com/2023/10/27/secret-military-base-israel-gaza-site-512/
Their recent actions show they consider civilian casualties to be the goal, not something to be avoided.
Disgusting.
Damn so many deleted comments on this thread....
Besides POV footage of Hamas shooting randomly into portable toilets at the rave, I have yet to see any raw footage from the initial attack besides this. I support the 8000 innocent civilians (and children) of Palestine who have been needlessly carpet bombed but I also hope more footage like this is released because there hasn't been much evidence that supports Israel's claims. I would appreciate any sustentative links.
This is sick. You can't put a camera on hostages. They have to say whatever. This is worse than Israel airing the Hamas interrogation.
Blazing saddles vibe &amp; if only there was a fat guy bring up the rear it could have been Jumanji
That‚Äôs what happens when you have clowns run your country. They let the wolves into the hen house.
The true Russia accomplishment, team kill their own military hardware better than most.
Look forward to the tour of the torture chambers underneath that hospital after Israel takes it.
For some reason I think Israel is going to hoard every weapon they can get their hands on for the next decade. They might finance some Ukrainian weapons tho.
full control now, fencing days are over
Kidskrieg
How can he kick?
Tanks are not as invulnerable as you'd think. You can get a mobility kill on them pretty easy without any special explosives. Treads are still a very weak spot for tanks, and nothing will ever fix that. Crew would have been survived a blast from a smaller vehicle bomb, like one found in a car. There would be a risk of the crew evacuating the tank.However, usually suicide bombers drive to you, not away. I doubt the tanker felt threatened
Probably not the right way to go about dispelling the theory that Jews run everything. (which I don't believe but am astounded at the actions people are taking which validate those theories)
It was not even a red card, chill dude.
There is a VERY large population that do not actually know this though. Be gentle.

More than likely. I‚Äôve already been auto temp banned in another sub for keywords in another sub in the topic.1984 is running towards us hard. :-/
It literally, turned out to be exactly what it looked like, an Israeli bomb. No one bombs their own hospital, what ‚Äústrategic advantage‚Äù does it give to bomb your own hospital? I‚Äôm legitimately curious how you are able to justify it as ‚Äúthey did it themselves‚Äù‚Ä¶

They are the closest working force to countries with negative population growth.  The US would do the same thing if Mexico wasn't so close.
So the 3200 dead kids were all terrorists? Good to know. /sThis seems to be the mindset of most of Israel's politicians and media personalities. It's fucking feral.
Crazy how precise these things are üò¨
this is Hezbollah which means this is southern Lebanon not Gaza
Half of Hamas = Mossad. They‚Äôre the real shit disturbers that convince the general Palestinian population to be part of the their movement. And with the existence of Hamas gives Israel the reason to invade Palestine. Also, do your research on the Mossad. Them mfs have agents in all governments, and major corporations. Fun fact, Robert Maxwell (Ghislaine Maxwell‚Äôs father). Was an ex- Mossad agent and lived a hell of a life.

A common way to move weapons above ground. Way overdone.
Didn't Hamas have to hand over hostages to the Red Crescent a week or two ago because Israel refused to take them?
It feels like the country that peaked in highschool.
What a disgusting comment
I mean they fire indiscriminately without any reasonable chance of hitting a legitimate military target because they are motivated by hate and committing genocide.I‚Äôm not sure what you mean.

I've seen nothing indicating that the average Israeli is having any trouble with what is being done in their name.
Because the ancestors of a lot of people in Israel had it bad through much of history. So...two wrongs make a right I guess?

Oh boo hoo, both Australian and Israeli are people who got sent to another country mostly involuntarily. The only difference between Australia and Israel is Australia did a much better job at wiping out the **native population from 1 - 1.5 millions into less than 100,000** within a few years in the 1900s, then continued to inflict generational trauma on the survivors and their descendants! The last residential school closed in the 1990s!!! The natives of Australia have never recovered and you dare say it's "in the past"?
Israel has commited war crimes against the Palestinians.
Fuck Israel. Free Palestine.
Disgusting
I'm fairly sure people eventually came to the conclusion that Hamas didn't have anything capable of blowing a hospital up and killing 500 people. The IDF very much did however, JDAM missiles supplied by the USA.
why tf would a tank shoot towards non uniformed individuals? Just guessing the unarmed civic that is backing away is a terrorist that should die? Grim way of seeing the world
you know I never knew that people saw muslim-run places as so bad until I stepped into these comments.

 At that point just use the bike. You're not out running a soldier. Let alone 20+
You're being downvoted because reddit doesn't understand anything other than "brown people bad. they kill you with their bare hands. IDF uses bombs because they are civilized."Doesn't matter if Israel is killing 420+ children a day.It's 9/11 all over again, and in 10 years all these bloodthirsty redditors are going to be claiming they were against the genocide of Palestine.
Contributing to the growth of radical Islam. Both Israel and Hamas are no different.
This is the exact reason, among many other vile reasons as to why Hamas was formed in the first place.
This is happening in 2023. Did we have anything like this in history?
The languages of the people in the area changed over millennia. Back in the 2nd millennium BCE, the languages included Phoenician, Hebrew, Ammorite, among others.
And just like the entire cities including schools churches and apartment complexes. Warnings nullify war crimes!
Yes, just like the warnings given to the kibbutzes and the dance festival on the 7th.
I guess humanity can never evolve and we all must follow your senseless logic generations into the future. Statements like this are truly rascist.
When Russia does it it's a war crime. When Israel does it it's collateral damage.
No the US has just financially supported Israeli terrorism for decades. Youre comment is horribly ignorant for not knowing that.

Even Palestinians only support hamas if they have been indoctrinated, or if they are forced to. Go look to see what Palestinians have dealt with from Hamas for years. There can be more than one enemy, sometimes their goals align. And if you do know people who are pro Hamas, then I hope I never meet any of those people. Fuck Hamas most of all.
Also, at the very end, someone on a moped or motorbike comes up and slows down and then drops over. Looks like the guy closer to the van that got hit first targets him and runs towards him after he falls.
There's also two frames right before the smoke, at 2:00, where you can see the rocket itself. One frame it's right on the blue light pole, next frame it's between the two trees by the car, then you see the smoke trail.
So you don't support the UN keeping track and wanting to prosecute Bibi?You just said  only one side gets repercussions. Idk what kind of repercussions you want though. Prosecution legally is the only one i could support, not raping and killing random kids to purposely start a war against people Hamas obviously does not care about. It's true that the prosecutions take way too long, this has always been true for the worst criminals.
What a brave man. Ceasefire or not, his family is not going to return to him. He understands that his voice is needed and document this into history. The moment in time when the world okayed a human catastrophe.
Thought as much. Hamas isn‚Äôt good by any means but I doubt half of what they said in the video is true.
Wow. Really proud of reddit right now. Not a single comment about her tiny ass hands
The 40 families that get locked up at 5p.m definitely did something to deserve it. Obviously they're the bully here. /s
"The power of Crime compels you!"
Made up most likely, this is normal israeli propganda fake info sprinkled with a  drop of truth to fool ignorant people
To kick a man when he‚Äôs down is disgusting
mm idk, Hamas kills Gazan civilians while claiming they fight for them, and on some channels are admitting they really could care less about if Palestinians live or die, in fact, it helps their cause if Palestinians die. This is why the top leaders aren't even there and the rest are getting all the cream, and are safe in the tunnels, while civilians suffer. Now if you go back and look at what Palestinians say, Hamas is evil. I truly believe if I had to choose either one, Hamas is the more evil of the two. But obviously there is plenty of evil to go around, enough for both IDF and Hamas. But I draw the line at Hamas having torture chambers for any Palestinian who does not support or promote them. But fight terror for long enough I guess you do sink down to their level.
They don't follow the Bible and that's not Manifest Destiny.
I hate Hamas. Still this might be the reason Hamas is treating civilians (settlers) not as innocents but legitimate enemy combatants.
Ah Brampton, This is in Ontario Canada, look at all the polite Canadians.edit: all the canadians saying they are not canadians or things along those lines drive the point home

I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not, but the United States of America is not in Israel or Palestine and is not at war with either. I assumed you're not aware, because your comment is only something a complete dipshit would say.
Hamas trying to make Israel look like murderers but they  kill so many civilians with beheadings and rockets, hiding underneath buildings that Israel can‚Äôt shoot at, fked up, kinda wish that they are allowed if weapons are used on those grounds
I mean they don‚Äôt exactly have Raytheon systems backing them up do they?
He and his family and some friends have been trying to take care of various Gazan animals for years. The situation has always been hard because there's not enough money or stability or even real vets I believe to start a clinic or anything, so it's always just to keep them fed and for basic treatments and safety.
Are you telling me that Palestinians have never attacked Israeli's in the West Bank?  I think you know the answer, ignore the answer, and hope that your deliberate prevarication is taken as truth by those who don't know better.

I don‚Äôt know, I once saw Primus, Tool and Everclear on New Years in Oakland. Pretty advanced bot to be a teenager experiencing such things. As it is with the progression of the internet, we will all doubt the validity of everything as we witness the enshittification - behold!
Yes, before the war Israel was dealing with a bit of a web of interests, including a large conservative ethnic Russian voting bloc that Netanyahu required to stay in power.Those issues no longer exist.
Where do you think they learned it from.
guess so?
Seems sarcasm literally that lost upon you.Do you need me to place the /s/ by my comment?
Having seen Israeli tanks shooting at civilian cars, I'm now convinced that the only difference between Israel and Hamas is that one speaks Arabic while the other speaks Hebrew. Beyond that, the only other difference is that one is better armed than the other. No matter which side you support, you're supporting terrorists.
This is in the West Bank, not Gaza, no Hamas.Clearly you have no clue.
that's what happens when the building supplies are pilfered by Hamas and all the civilians have left to build with is desert dust, chewing gum, and prayers to allah.
More than just Zionist narratives, too. I got banned from pushing back on American jingoist propaganda.
Savages. There's no point in having an ICC when the US can just veto anything they want and block any action.
yeah seems like a troll heavy sub primed for spreading misinfo
A concentration camp is a camp where you concentrate people to further some non-aid related purpose. That's basically the be all end all definition.
&gt;They'd be disgusted with your antics and the state of America today.My?  MY!  WTF is this 'my'?He started it, Mom.
IDF: Why are you not engaging me in extremely one-sided conventional warfare? I specifically requested it. But seriously, you expect Hamas to fight the IDF in a direct battle where they are sure to lose? They‚Äôll melt into the debris and civilian population and pop back up when the IDF calls ‚ÄúMission Accomplished‚Äù and goes home. That‚Äôs just guerrilla warfare 101.
Um, I have seen no evidence these were combatants. Maybe you missed that part. No guns hanging out the windows, not driving recklessly towards combatants, no bullet holes, nothing. You just go on and on about rules of war, when my point is - give me ANYTHING that makes this make sense. You‚Äôve got NOTHING because it is as bad as it looks until you (or more importantly the government operating the tank) fucking provides legitimate counterfactual evidence to the video we just saw. And if you tell me they don‚Äôt have the video evidence or don‚Äôt have to - you are willfully lying. It‚Äôs the 21st century, and impoverished Palestinians have video, we just saw it.And please, no whataboutisms. Evil is evil and wrong is wrong. All war criminals should be punished. Start with Kissinger, Bush, Cheney, Rumsfeld, and Obama‚Ä¶. I don‚Äôt care, lock them all up. Merchants of Death the whole lot.

You mean people from Israel are smart enough to evacuate when they're told to do so?
Brazil is a country plagued by mediocre elites too enamored with bad ideas, tbh.We tend to be far too attached to things that don't work for far too long.
So, what‚Äôs the price? US has 9/11 happen and kills millions of civilians in two countries over 10+ years. Is that what Israel gets to do, kill as many until their satisfied? And it‚Äôs all justifiable.
I think they were mad she said data instead of data.
Imagine all the people living near this area,it will be wiped out probably,poor people
Do you need a link to explain why genocide is bad?
Gaza will not be livable. The only reason it‚Äôs not razed by now is the hostages and the bleeding western hearts who just recently discovered how people in the Middle East have lived for hundreds of years and they‚Äôre outraged by it lol
I'm saying it's ridiculous that in 100 years, the Ashkenazi of Europe are doing the same thing that was done to them.
No, we're not. We have achieved a critical mass of assholes in Congress and are running out of hope.
shooting kids is easier from a sitting position(too soon?)
I was thinking it was recorded with half a durian fruit...
Hahaha love it
Seeing as how IDF were able to execute the rescue of a high value hostage overnight, I‚Äôm guessing Hamas are definitely not military strategists. They aren‚Äôt even remotely intelligent. Their only purpose is to be Iran‚Äôs fodder. Intelligent fodder isn‚Äôt as useful as idiotic fodder.
Need that military dripHowever...This conflict is known for being one of the first in Latin America having some air power involved, so I assume it was an attempt to hide from aerial recon when air tactics and capabilities were still widely experimental in Brazil.
Standing up for human rights is antisemitic /s
It goes to show if they were in Israel‚Äôs position then it would be an actual genocide not like what the leftists are claiming Israel is doing
"you see the arrogance?"The hypocrisy lol.
Do you have a link for this?
Don‚Äôt engage; this is hasbara

Just wondering about how much we can trust a video of hostages filmed and released by the hostage takers. They make some valid points, but it is not like they are not under derres while filming.
Police are civilians.

It was a pro-republican revolt against the establishment of a dictatorship by then president Get√∫lio Vargas by liberals from S√£o Paulo. Sadly, they lost, and Get√∫lio went on to rule until 1945 after which he stepped down when the contradiction of a quad facist dictatorship fighting on the side of the allies became too much to sustain

You know, the sad part is that many settlers actually do not live there. The settlements are just a way to isolate the Palestinian enclaves so that they don‚Äôt communicate or grow organically and to claim the land for Israel. Settlers get financial incentives to ‚Äúlive‚Äù there, but many don‚Äôt. The life of Palestinians is brutal under Israel
Edit  what zionists  doing to the palestinians  they justify that some Europeans did it to the local  Jewish population. this goes against the claim that they are originally from that land doesn't it...
Im pretty sure the guys at that airport were rosgvardia units and not spetsnaz.
It‚Äôs crazy, you could see his two teammates that got between them immediately realize what was about to happen
Propaganda is a helluva drug holy shit. This is like the comment form of a Dave chappelle skit. I‚Äôm baffled.
Dead in peace?
..... and the genes of the Ashkenazi jews are an average 8% middle eastern and between 50 to 80% European depending upon the study.It's Europeans that Europe was too xenophobic to allow to live peacefully on "their" land now practicing ethnic cleansing against the Arabs of the middle east that these Europeans are too xenophobic to allow to live peacefully on "their" land.
I said we should try to be better today, even if our ancestors did something wrong in the past.how did you translate that to "I should submit to settler colonialism and occupation and apartheid and let an Israeli lock me at 5pm" ?

Hi what do you call war crimes. And why do you call it that way

Umm no actually it isn't "over" at all. https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-53436225But your wording is interesting. Are you saying Palestinians no longer have claim to land they once had because that's "in the past"?
No one said you had to‚Ä¶
Of course. If you‚Äôre going to do it though they can atleast be semi civil. They‚Äôre wasting RPGs like they have a massive supply. It‚Äôs probably gonna be difficult to identify the body and return them to their families.
What is your solution?
Well that's over now, isn't it? All nations have committed atrocities in the past. We should still try to be better today.Edit : I can't reply so I'm updating this comment. I'm not educated about the natives of Australia. I can't speak about it. It takes many generations to heal from having your land taken and I know that. But I'm sure the war is over now. No one is trying to ethnically cleanse them anymore. They can walk any street any time they want, no one is locking them up at a certain time. The world cannot keep acting like it's the 1900s today. This shouldn't be okay because it happened 1000 years ago.

Impossible to film, mutineers were also ghosts.
Oh boy where to begin.&gt;This is also part of the narrative - that you can‚Äôt criticize Israel without first going through the full routine of Hamas condemnationNope, you completely missed the point. I am illustrating ways in which Hamas is actively encouraging the civilian death toll, something you conveniently omit. It is as if you hold Israel completely responsible for civilian casualties.[https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/hamas\_human\_shields.pdf](https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/hamas_human_shields.pdf)You did not answer my question. **Do you think Hamas should be eradicated? If so, how you expect that to be done?**&gt;Hamas didn‚Äôt prevent anyone from going to southern Gaza.There's photographic [evidence](https://youtu.be/fMV9HAEK-5A?si=w7mRAhukRoH7i8uk) and [phone calls](https://youtu.be/kaK4muqkRBE?si=qfni4FqQHT0T4xo7) of this.&gt;Israel has since been bombing the living shit out of Southern Gaza.Sorry I didn't get the message. Does Hamas not exist in Southern Gaza? Moving civilians out of Gaza City is preparing the battlefield for a ground offensive. That doesn't mean Southern Gaza is excluded from the conflict.Yes, I am fully aware this information comes directly from the IDF and has the potential to be pure propaganda like anything else coming out of the this conflict. However, you are going to claim this is misinformation, at least back it up with evidence.&gt;You don‚Äôt cut off water, food and medicine to 2.2 million people, half of which are children, and pretend you want to minimize civilian casualties.Again, is this Israel's responsibility to provide these services in war? Hamas could release the hostages and aid would flow. Another key detail is that Hamas is sitting on significant stockpiles of supplies, supplies they could be giving to their starving people. You are silent of this again.This is referenced in first link, but here is another [one](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/world/middleeast/palestine-gazans-hamas-food.html?smid=url-share):&gt;Civilian casualties is the goal for IsraelYour opinion, not a fact. Again, let's see evidence.&gt;Your take on the geopolitical dynamic oversimplifies a lotThis is Reddit, not a JSTOR. I will be simplifying when applicable because going into the intricacies and nuances of Sunni/Shia relations is neither productive nor important in this context. I never claimed the Israel/Palestine conflict was religious, but it's hard to ignore the antisemitism when you celebrate killing "[Jews](https://youtu.be/TuAAGb_Sf-o?si=A9WtxzI4i4t_G14h)". I am not going to link the direct POV footage here so forgive me using secondary sources.&gt;Netanyahu had truly thought he could ignore the Palestinians and manage them to be in constant subjugationThis I actually agree with you, but I think containment is more accurate than subjugation.&gt;This what about-ism you talk of - regarding Israel‚Äôs neighbors being bad on human rights, it‚Äôs also another unproductive part of the narrative that is often used by the pro Israel camp. It‚Äôs irrelevant to the discussion we‚Äôre havingAgain, I agree. Let's get back to the original point of discussion, which is that **Israel is intentionally targeting civilians.** I am willing to hear you out if you have evidence, but you have provided nothing except history of the Palestinian struggle. Believe it or not I will actually read/listen to them, but that is irrelevant to you claim.
That‚Äôs overkill and dangerous. They could have just used one of the many AKs they have.The car was only like 10 meters away. The shrapnel from the explosion is extremely dangerous. Especially since they don‚Äôt seem to be wearing any sorta eye protection.
Yup, anyone that's seriously looked at this from a secular point of view sees how incredibly complicated this situation is.That tank shooting that car is not at all complicated, the whole conflict is.
Fortunately it wasn't destroyed, just damaged
Precisely. Tell that to everyone born in the American concentration camps of Japanese during WWII.
yeah, thats a mistake. The IDF should relized that in today media no one care that it has standard proceeders for creating targets that involve how much valuable this target is and what the chance of uninvolved civilians there and without releasing more info in timely matter people think its all carpet bombing.  and that the blurry black and white footages is useless to non professionals
Kids with rocks fighting a billion dollar army The IDF are cowards.
youd vote for newsome for president? BIG YIKES. Dude cant even keep his own kids outta "mini cults" much less handle world politics.
Free palestine
One just wants their land back and rightfully so. Have you not seen the type of bs the ‚Äúsettlers‚Äù have been doing in the West Bank with the help of the idf? At some point a pushback was bound to happen
This is corporate America- Don‚Äôt forget to pick up the Newport‚Äôs.
Right, but there's loads of video out there "demonstrating" that this attack was by Israel and that that target was actually a school or whatever. It seems odd that the IDF isn't putting out their media in a way that attempts to counter that.
And this is why the Palestinians will never win.  On one side, you have a significant cohort of people who are good at important shit while the other side manufactures spite.Prosaically, American, European and Asian companies with significant investments in Israel and a disproportionate number of employees won't nudge the Israelis to do anything different as having Gazans behave themselves derisk their investments.  Writing this up, it occurred to me that relationships with large firms is the most important part of a _Startup Nation_.
One of the strongest man standing right here
I mean, LMAO, but yeah, I think they meant humanity..they maybe meant human morality, and figured humanality fits. Or I made it up, idk.
The Kingdom of Israel has been around since 900 BCE on the lands they live now.  the Jews have always lived there.  These protestors all over the world have no clue on true archeology and history of the lands.
It really highlights to me how little they mind about international opinion - any context or explanation at all to describe the target and whatever care they want to say went into it's selection and attack would be nothing but good for that. But all they're producing is videos of things going boom, which probably makes a lot of sense if they just want to appease some recently-traumatised potential voters.Though it's even weirder with this coming after the complete cock up by the Israeli defence apparatus - "no, you can trust us _now_ to be getting it right"

Which fighter aircraft is this.Is there any footage from isreali f-35s
That's a very real possibility. And one that Israel and the US are considering all the time. Hezbollah in Lebanon allegedly has many tens of thousands of missiles, including precision-guided munitions. One of the theories is that they might coordinate with Hamas and all launch thousands upon thousands of dumb-fire rockets over the course of a couple days, and then immediately follow with thousands of precision missiles to target Israel infrastructure, airports, military, hospitals, government buildings, etc. Followed by ground assault. But they'd probably only do this with Iran backing them up. But the US would join Israel in its defense and turn southern Lebanon into a crater.
How would you determine that any released video wasn't also faked?What's in it for Israel as far as releasing the footage? Anyone who doesn't believe what has already been released wouldn't believe the footage, and unless you're a voter in Israel you're just not someone they're trying to convince.

Don't fucking care. Both groups can go kill each other defending their god however they want. I'm just sick of sending them money and aid and this constantly being on everything. No one fucking cares. Just burn it all down, burn each other down, been arguing over the same shit box piece of dirt and over the same religious bullshit forever. Get the fuck over it.
Committing genocide: Hamas or Israel?*Creating* Hamas: Hamas or Israel? (with US full support and funding)Murdering their own civilians knowingly because they know they can spin it and blame Hamas: Hamas or Israel?Producing zero evidence of claimed massacres except post-shelling footage committed by IDF against known-Israeli civilian homes and then claiming those civilians were murdered by Hamas: Hamas or Israel?Pretending Hamas represents the will of an entire population and allowing that sentiment to permeate into all western mainstream news: Hamas or Israel?
I honestly want to believe that most Israelis are decent normal human beings. But it's getting harder every time I see shit like this.
Fuck religion. This is absolutely disgusting.

Biden: "Thats war! Heres some morw weapons to kill more terrorists!"
This is the problem of conventional army against terror organization. While Israel done research and checked for who to blame on the hospital hit, making sure no army branch was involved Hamas already told the world it was an airstrike and how many casualties they got. after 3-4 hours Israel assure there was no attack but in internet time it's ages.
Me neither. Who won? Who started? Who fought?
They are trying to commit a genocide‚Ä¶ talk about a shit country, from a group of people that survived the holocaust, to trying to have it happen again, brilliant
‚ÄúMany people are saying‚Äù levels of copium from terrorism supporters I see.
And that was a lot more recent and their direct descendants are still here. Right now everyone looks back at what happened to the native Americans as a tragedy. Then we turn right around and do it to the Palestinians. I‚Äôm sure in some 100 year everyone will say the same about that too.
Liquid concrete-type material will be used. It is what IDF used before.
What‚Äôs unique to israel is that they are coddled by the western world as some sort of innocent peace loving nation who does no wrong, that‚Äôs oppressed by all these bad terrorists around them. So they receive a ridiculous amount of money, state of the art weapons and a free pass to terrorize the defenseless palestinians around them.

In my experience, this subreddit has always had a somewhat steady stream of videos related to the Arab-Israeli conflict. Or rather, one or two videos that get spammed multiple times. Recent events have just thrown it into overdrive.
They do have snipers. Good? I dont know.
You didn't find the intelligence failure and military standoff/attacking their own bases... coincidental? in the fact that it allowed for the current government to declare a war government that would achieve its open political goal.You haven't found the open funding of Hamas for years, by Netanyahu strange? Because he openly supports a radicalized weak Palestine over a politically oriented weak Palestine.I find it strange, unless I look at this whole situation from a cynical view.
Buddy, we have no way of knowing who was in that car. That's just the truth. It could've been a family. It could've been militants packing AKs. We don't know. The fact that Hamas uses civilian vehicles further obscures our understanding.I know it sucks, but that's just the reality of it.
This guy is a dick.
I did, but I was expecting a rebellion in Chechnya, not... this.
Well, I was more specifically talking about the USSR, but still. Russias position has also been to support oppressed groups around the world, to counteract the status quo and gain more political leverage.What wagner is doing is also not acting entirely upon russian interest either, and does not completely represent russian interests in Africa. They're still a PMC, although their operations in Ukraine are heavily subsidized by the russian state

After this in depth research, I can confirm that it was indeed fired by an RPG, but not from the guy standing in the front of the street. This is most likely the kind of ammunition used which is typically fired by RPG's. [https://arconpartners.net/products/ammunition/grenade-launchers/40-mm-tb-7v-round-with-thermobaric-grenade-tb-7-for-40-mm-hand-grenade-launcher-rpg-7v/](https://arconpartners.net/products/ammunition/grenade-launchers/40-mm-tb-7v-round-with-thermobaric-grenade-tb-7-for-40-mm-hand-grenade-launcher-rpg-7v/)

They already have.
I‚Äôm not doubting this, but do you have a source so I can read more and learn more? Any idea what this department is named?
You're kind of dumb dude
This really needs to be spread more. Many Babylonian Jews enjoyed high status and wealth, Israeli Ashkenazi's needed labor so they cut a deal with Iraq to forcibly move them to Israel. [Iraqi Jews went from wealth to living in Israeli tents for 10-20 years.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gwfwpSQhbXw)
They also fired thermobaric rockets into the school. But even that pales in comparison to that theater in Moscow where Spetsnaz just gassed the place. If you are ever taken hostage in Russia just join the terrorists,your chances of survival are probably higher than if you just wait to be rescued.
 According to [this source](https://web.archive.org/web/20090216191929/http://maritimesecurity.com/rpg7.htm), " The rocket is shot out of the tube by an explosive booster which gets it moving towards the target for about ten meters while the internal rocket motor is simultaneously igniting. The firing sequence produces a sizable back-blast with report, and the rocket leaves a smoke trail while traveling to the target giving it a very visible launch signature. "This explains why there is a small smoke explosion as the rocket travels through the air, though, you may have been confused since some newer models immediately activate rocket propulsion from the start.
&gt; killing civilians is the pointhow can you truly believe this? if so why didn't they do all this before 10/7, fucking hell the stupidity boggles my mind.

It‚Äôs amazing they will go out of the way to chastise that video, but turn a blind eye to literally shooting an rpg into a vehicle and then gunning down whoever was left alive from the rocket.
Just Palestinian terrorists doing what they do from hospitals, mosques, nursing homes and schools.
Lol, why do you think the Sunni majority Taliban are quiet on these affairs? Because they damn well know the Iranians just wanted to lead a bunch of Sunni to the slaughter while spiting Israel in the process. Iran are exploiting the Gazan people through hamas, but oh its all Israel's fault.
The two situations have no parallels.
Nothing to worry about?  Clearly he has a short memory.
He wanted to go back and hurt him more.  What a dooshbag
That's what the two carrier strike groups is for to deter that.
You can see the burst of smoke when the rocket ignites its thrusters. It is in fact an rocket. Was it fired by an RPG? I do not know.Go to 0:48 in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P439jWJTQ-0) video to see an example. Then cross reference the smoke blast to the smoke in the video. The smoke comes out from behind the rocket to propel it into the car, proving it came from the right of the camera.Rockets do not ignite thrusters immediately in front of the person that fired them, that would hurt.  Edit: Fixed a misspelling in thrusters
Yeah true,Russian antisemitism goes a looooong way back,they gave the word ''pogrom'' to the world after all. Also don't ask them what happened in 1939-1941...
I agree - these content creators are shameless and cashing in on suffering and misery is deplorable.
Doesn‚Äôt look like a country in mourning
This is frankly the *least* supportive of Israel a U.S. administration has been in recent memory. Or, perhaps it's more accurate to say this incident has sparked the greatest disparity between sensationalized news coverage and reality. 'Cause don't get me wrong ‚Äî the US is still clearly backing Israel here insofar as they are a US ally that was attacked, but outside of a few early statements of unconditional solidarity, the message coming out of the White House, State, and Defense Departments since then seems to be pretty cautionary. * The advisors originally sent to Israel in the wake of the attack, or at least those photographed while there, were mainly Delta Force guys and soldiers from the Army's Critical Threats Advisory Company (CTAC). These are the best of the best for small footprint operations and specifically hostage rescue. * Israel repeatedly delayed the offensive for roughly two weeks after they initially announced it. * Lt. Gen. James Glynn, a veteran of America's most brutal urban fighting in Fallujah, and later Commander of USMC Special Operations, also went over to advise the Israelis on their planned ground offensive, but ‚Äî critically ‚Äî he left earlier than expected, and *before* the offensive began.All of this suggests to me that despite whatever public statements US politicians were saying in front of cameras, behind the scenes there was an intense pressure campaign to convince the Israelis *not* to do exactly what they're doing now. They were clearly trying to buy time in the hopes that cooler heads would prevail. We sent people with expertise at rescuing hostages and hunting terrorists as quickly and quietly as possible, to advise them on the *right* way to seek justice without catastrophic blowback and civilian loss. And failing that, we sent one of our most senior officers with firsthand experience in how devastating an incursion like what they're doing could be, both for the people of Gaza and the IDF themselves. It's telling that he abruptly left the country, and then the invasion began. The Biden admin clearly wants to distance itself from what comes next. And no, going to a longtime ally and saying, "Hey bud, don't do this. You'll regret it," is not the same thing as slapping them enthusiastically on the back and saying, "You got this!" Both could be characterized as advising, and thus "support." But one is not like the other. &amp;nbsp;I think the most interesting thing here is the wave of news articles that point to Biden calling for an "unprecedented" aid package to Israel: $105 billion! But when you drill down into it, the budget request allocates money to countries as far flung as Latvia, Peru, and Kenya. The vast majority of it (61.4 billion, or 58%) goes to Ukraine. Another 20% is split between border security and U.S. military capabilities in the Asia Pacific, and a little over 8.5% is earmarked for humanitarian aid through organizations like State Department, HHS, and USAID. Only 13.5% is military aid to Israel, and even then, the reality is more nuanced.&amp;nbsp;Digging deeper into the actual [Budget Request](https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Letter-regarding-critical-national-security-funding-needs-for-FY-2024.pdf), we see the following on pages 28-34:* 36% of the military aid is for defensive use only (i.e. 4 billion to restock and redeploy their Iron Dome air defense system and 1.2 billion for further R&amp;D on it)* 61% is for purposes I'm broadly lumping under "potentially offensive." The wording is opaque, but it's mostly slotted for DOD to "replenish" stockpiles of ammunition &amp; other materiel. * Early in the crisis (during the Hamas attack), the U.S. released a stockpile of ammunition located in Israel to the IDF to use. Some of this money is likely replacing what we already gave away. * Much of the other money also probably flows the same way ‚Äî replacing GBU-31s and other JDAM units we've already given Israel. * The remaining 3% of funding is split between unspent emergency funds, increased security at the US Embassy, and State Department funding to help Americans who want to leave the country.All told, that 61% of potentially offensive aid ($8.7 billion if I counted right) is only a mere ~8% of the $105 billion dollars requested by Biden, and less than the total amount requested for humanitarian purposes (though these are admittedly up to the discretion of State Department, and will be split across a whole bunch of mostly relevant Middle Eastern countries, but also Ukraine).&amp;nbsp;Now, it's entirely fair to think that even $1 is a dollar too many to give Israel given their abhorrent response to the attack, but the topline numbers and punchy headlines are really misleading on this issue. I have serious qualms with giving Israel munitions that will be used in Gaza, but don't think it's a horrible thing to help Israel reequip and improve its air defense system against rocket attacks. It was just overwhelmed by a saturation of fire, and that's a vulnerability that needs to be addressed. All that to say basically this: Politicians make public statements to their constituents, but the available evidence suggests that privately and in reality, the U.S. is not funding, backing, or assisting Israel to *nearly* the degree as is being implied a lot online. There's a bigger question of whether Israel needs any aid at all (probably not), but that $8 Billion-ish being that is likely going towards offensive weapons is a bad look for the U.S. Still, $8 billion is far less than $105 billion, and I honestly don't take issue with bolstering the Iron Dome system or giving State Department more resources to look after Americans in both Israel and Gaza.
If you call everyone an enemy you can kill anyone. Witness says family in the car. Context matter. Your attitude is what is allowing a genocide.
That's a boom as used by the USAF, not a [probe and drogue](https://news.usni.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/F-18F_refueling_F-18E.jpg) which is used by the USN.I never said that the RC-135 can't air to air refuel, just that it is unlikely it *has* to in order to operate off Gaza, and that I *don't believe* it can refuel from Navy assets since I can't find anything about it having a probe, just a boom receptacle.Few if any USAF fixed wing aircraft have provision for refueling by probe and drogue to my knowledge.

Just need to repost comments from that tank shooting a civilians car in Gaza to really incite a shit show. The real public freakout is the comments
Look again please. He doesn't fire it. The explosive comes from the right of the screen and the man in the middle of the street still has the rocket in his RPG when the car explodes.
The RC135 Rivet Joint refueling in airhttps://www.dvidshub.net/image/6680683/us-air-force-kc-135r-stratotanker-refuels-us-air-force-rc-135-rivet-jointWell it's flight plan began and ended at the aircraft carrier. So it could be that once it hit the carrier group it's mission actually began and it received a different designation. When it heads back tonight I'm going to see if I can't tell where it goes after it returns. Maybe changes signature again and then heads back to whatever base it comes out of.Still like 6 hours till then so we will see
There was a dude literally in the middle of the street that fired the rocket‚Ä¶
Yes, throw rocks at it. Like that's gonna do anything.
There‚Äôs always a lad with a screw loose in every team

Israelis celebrates X, Palestinians celebrate Y. It‚Äôs a war of who did something worse and whataboutism
Most Americans do not support this. The government hasn‚Äôt represented its citizens for a long time. For the people by the people was a nice sentiment.
Question: You seem to be justifying the killing of civilians because a terrorist group killed civilians in Israel.  But since Israel is killing astronomically more innocent civilians, does that mean Palestinians would be justified in killing a bunch of innocent Israeli citizens?  Or is that logic one-sided?
Weird how well before October 7 there is many videos of IDF shooting kids. I'm doubting you've researched this conflict any deeper though.
Equipment used, breaching technique used, number and composition of the force that freed her, existence of local informers with the force and probably more that I'm not thinking of.I don't know what's the point of you coping that hard, the truth will come out eventually, right? I mean, we have her name, rank, position, the base she served in. All her friends at home, or family members, or people who served with her on base are bound to talk eventually about how she was never abducted, right? All you need to do is just sit and wait for the truth to be revealed. Why so nervous?

Girl bobbed and weaved like George W Bush.
The car may have not been shot by an RPG since the shot came out of the view of the camera and it is impossible to identify the explosive through the air. It's hard to tell why exactly the title is misleading.&amp;#x200B;Perhaps our Reddit Forensic Specialists can confirm the nature of the explosive via the explosion?
Disgusting
It definitely is premium cope.
https://youtube.com/shorts/1M9mPlRp9m4?si=qUvn77RoRRV3Oy44They used footage of an Israeli combat medic triage exercise to say they were being affected by Ghosts. High levels of cope.
Or an EFP
What the fuck is this ü§£
Get the tactical tefillin! [https://www.idfstore.com/tefillin-and-tzitzit-carry-case-camo-print-tfb-01.html](https://www.idfstore.com/tefillin-and-tzitzit-carry-case-camo-print-tfb-01.html) &amp;#x200B;Call the dybbuk busters!
In 2014 their stated goal was to destroy the tunnels. The IDF was specifically ordered not to go too deeply because they didn't want to end up conquering Gaza and be responsible for the whole stinking mess. Yeah, it ended with the tunnels being destroyed and an orderly IDF withdrawal, as planned. I lived through those events so I remember them clear as day. But I know there's no point trying to convince the brainwashed. I'm looking forward to saying "I told you so" in a couple of weeks. Not that I'll expect an answer, since your kind tend to disappear without a trace when proved embarrassingly wrong.
What do ya know a bunch of the arrested are now being mobilized. Lol https://www.instagram.com/p/CzCao9OuZLv/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
That new 23 pixel high def is really shining here.
Since the sirens sound and everyone takes cover in bomb shelters (at least are supposed to), that likelihood is probably low (at least as far as personal injuries are concerned)
Like what exactly? Explain what would it reveal then? What is the very valuable info it would reveal?with video muted too?Them going in a room and finding her? And killing qassam members?
Miniature Air-Launched Decoy, MALD. Yeah that would be a possibility since their use by Ukraine is documented.
How about a plane full of claymores?
Pretty sure the RC-135 doesn't have a probe for aerial refueling, and all of the USN's buddy tankers use probe &amp; drogue, not a boom like the USAF does.RC-135's aren't going to be tanking from navy aircraft, its range is sufficient that it doesn't need to really and the Navy aircraft don't carry enough fuel to top it off in one go (would likely need \~10 F-18s to top off a RC-135). From what I've read the buddy tanking system is only used to top off the carriers own aircraft after they take off so they have full fuel at altitude, or provide a quick top up to landing aircraft that are low on fuel, not to actually extend the range of the air group. Also, the A-6 and KA-6 has been out of service for over two decades and there is maybe a half dozen MQ-25s built to date, all of them as far as I can tell are currently in testing in California, not active service.
Yes just like back in 2014 when they couldn't take over gaza and had to leave gaza like rodents, it'll be awesome:)
Embarrassing lack of understanding of how OPSEC works. Even a still frame can potentially reveal tons of info.
Strangely, American Zionists never seem to apply this rationale to native Americans.
If they didn‚Äôt care about collateral damage then they wouldn‚Äôt be using guided bombs
One missile is 50k. So we just saw a million$ worth of ordnance explode.
Ah, as I thought, no suggestions. Yeah, no, the baby-beheaders aren't going to get away this time, civilians or not. If they want this to stop they always have the option of unconditional surrender and returning all their hostages. Otherwise, boo-hoo.
They‚Äôve been launching air strikes on Gaza since Way before the conflict
God is Gene Parmesan?
And I thought GTA was exaggerating
?????? Classified operation?????  They are going in to save the hostages lmao, yesh a 5 second clip of them finding the hostage will blow up the whole deal and show everything they've done and reveal all the secrets of their military, lmao you're delusionalWhat would a 5 second clip from one of their go pros do to their operations of just them finding the hostage? Nothing but they can't provide it because it doesn't exist lmao
If you look closely the approaching vehicle has some sort of emergency light blinking on the bottom of the windshield.  Perhaps it was police or something.
Who had jihad in Russia  on their bingo cards?
Can't wait for the cope a couple of weeks from now. It's going to be epic.
Just saying "human shields" doesn't give you a carte balance to slaughter people.
Saving this so I can learn more about this event later. I know so little about my country‚Äôs history
When they target civilians they're terrorists, when Israel targets civillians theyre just defending themselves. Both are wrong, but only one side gets repercussions.
Didn‚Äôt Israel tell them to go south and give them 17 days to do so?
I would assume it's because the car drove towards Hamas members and therefore it wouldn't be an ambush.&amp;#x200B;FYI: This isn't what I believe or think, I don't share that stuff on Reddit. This is just my best guess at the reason the title is labelled as so.&amp;#x200B;Can anyone tell me what the flashing light on the dashboard of the exploding car is?
Are you daft? You think they're going to show you the footage from a classified operation and reveal doctrines that will be used to free more hostages in the future? And her family who are crying in the videos is what, hired actors? Jesus, the cope is real.
These  fuckers  has no shame
Dude, I agree with you. I‚Äôm not excusing the actions the Israeli government. It‚Äôs abhorrent. We need to oust this fascist regime.
Yes because Hamas uses them as shields
"Israeli planes from the Israeli Air Force conducting CAS in order to give close air support to Israeli IDF soldiers who carry rifles on the ground who are also from Israel."
I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm on the right side of history this time. Wiping out Hamas will actually give some hope to the Gazans. Now they‚Äôve none, thanks to Hamas.
Doing there job I suppose
One of the Mossad leaders was at Qatar trying to move forward with the deal. Hamas said they will need a week or two to gather ‚Äúa list of all the hostages they have‚ÄùClearly - trying to stall and create enough diplomatic pressure on Israel to reach a ceasefire. At which point they can crown their operation a success (despite the destruction and horrors civilian populations have gone through)Just a reminder - these are the same hamas that beheaded, burned and raped innocent people.
Delusionalarmchairexpertsaywhat?
 Lmao some of the arrested mob are being mobilized as punishment https://www.instagram.com/p/CzCao9OuZLv/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
Look at what you said. Ethnic cleanings in EASTERN EUROPE. Israel has murdered 4,000 Palestinian children in less than one month. The Palestinians should not be paying in blood the price of someone else‚Äôs pogroms and cruelty. And Zionists didn‚Äôt learn, if they are perpetuating the same violence, bloodshed and and persecution
stop posting palestine/israel crap, no one cares
Yah, I didn't know Israel used killdozers
Taking anything the IDF (or Hamas) says at face value is idiotic and will skew you very far from the truth.  Idk maybe Israel‚Äôs massive bombing campaign (honestly idk what they are targeting btw) that has only intensified in the past couple days slowed negotiations don‚Äôt you think.
I wish more women would threaten to pee on me.
You mean by ethnic cleaning of non zionist jews by mossad and zionist groups  ? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/1950%E2%80%931951_Baghdad_bombings
I don‚Äôt. The IDF‚Äôs intelligence does have a way and thats the conclusion they reached.If they are still that serious the deal should still be on the table right?
That‚Äôs even wilder. Stop feeding Caucasus!
They are both racist and trying to cleanse each other from the area. Killing/preventing future generations is one tactic of doing so. Both sides are fucked up and need to stop killing citizens
It came out that there actually were 15 Israeli citizens among them, but most of the passengers were Dagestani children and their parents returning from specialist hospital treatment in Israel. The crowd caught a guy who they thought looked like a Jew, but he was just an medical doctor of Uzbek descent who was on the flight.
?? You have no way of knowing that.  Buy time for what exactly?  Hamas will never be able to contest with Israel in combat they know that everyone knows that.
This is what targeting civilians actually looks like.
And that is the character of the people of Israel.
Zionists = terrorists.
It is terrible indeed and it reminds me of Russian tanks in Ukraine shooting at everyone and everything
Welcome to a lifelong ban, chucklefuck
Hamas offered that exchange as a means to stall and buy time. They were never serious about it.
Demonstration of how **not** to respond to getting a yellow card.
And this is the more diverse region. Now imagine the rural, 90% Russian areas.
If they were trying to free hostages they would‚Äôve done so already.  Hamas offered a prisoner exchange
nah, the "good ones" has become sunflowers already...  they have left the bad, ones.The "newbs" with lesser Training, and so on.They have still to learn that how to handle a crowd.

Everything can be 'Murrica bad to those commies. Even Castro blamed his insane 'tiny cows for all families' project failure on America.
I think the chunky pixel rate makes it even funnier.
I genuinely encourage you to go investigate one of those cases deeply and come back with conclusions.Take for say the hospital explosion.IDF has provided 1. Several videos (including one from Al-Jazeera live stream) of a rocket barrage at that exact time being fired from a graveyard behind the hospital. The successful rocket launches can be seen flying straight above the hospital.The footage also shows one failed rocket.2. Phone calls between hamas members admitting it was Palastinien Islamic Jihad rocket and not an israeli airstrike.3. A video from a gazan bystander recording the event has a ‚Äúwhistle‚Äù sound a rocket makes and not a bomb being dropped4. Ariel footage of the hospital after the bombing - which seems intact and only the parking lot is damaged( *with no impact crater* )5. Reports by 3rd parties that reached the same conclusion.6. The death toll hamas tried to publish was completely absurd, initial report said 10 people died. Then 100 people. Then 500 people. Then 800. Minutes after this happened.7. Look up the percentage of failed missile launches from Gaza.What has hamas published? A statement and propaganda.
My guy - respectfully, you have fallen for the narrative.You wrote a really long paragraph about Hamas. I‚Äôm not here to defend Hamas. This is also part of the narrative - that you can‚Äôt criticize Israel without first going through the full routine of Hamas condemnation. As I said - I‚Äôm not here to defend Hamas. But what I will say a couple of things on that point since you brought it up. First, like the UN Gen Sec said last week, Oct 7 did not happen in a vacuum. This contextualization (NOT to be confused with justification) is important. Second, so much of what you said is part of the false narrative. Hamas didn‚Äôt prevent anyone from going to southern Gaza. Literally hundreds of thousands of Palestinians did go there freely. And guess what? Israel has since been bombing the living shit out of Southern Gaza. You claim that Israel has made a concerted effort to minimize civilian casualties but that is literally not true and no on else outside of the US believes that. You don‚Äôt cut off water, food and medicine to 2.2 million people, half of which are children, and pretend you want to minimize civilian casualties. Civilian casualties is the goal for Israel. It wants to erase the will of the Palestinian people, something it‚Äôs as been trying to do for decades on end without success. Your take on the geopolitical dynamic oversimplifies a lot (regarding Saudi, Iran, etc.). Palestinian militancy has always been a thing, independent of regional power jockeying. This claim that Hamas just wanted to kill Jews is also weak. They wanted to kill Israelis - no one doubts that. But when you say it the way you did it‚Äôs as if to say that if Israel was formed the way it was and occupied and colonized the Palestinians the way it did, but was a nation of Buddhists / Hindus / Atheists / fire worshippers / whatever, that the Palestinians would just be like ‚Äúah okay, they‚Äôre not Jews so let‚Äôs just accept the subjugation, it‚Äôs all good.‚Äù You should spend some time reading on the history of Palestinian armed struggle. Long before Hamas was born (40+ years after Israel‚Äôs creation), most Palestinian militancy was inspired by leftist / secular / socialist types like the PFLP in the 70‚Äôs for example. These guys weren‚Äôt religious, let alone religious fanatics, but fought Israel on the grounds of what they saw as an aggressor that needed to be resisted, not because they were Jews. That part of the narrative needs to stop.You should also consider the fact that Israel, with help from the US, has essentially shut off the door to non violent resistance for the Palestinians. If they take action at the UN, Israel withholds their tax remittances, for example. Did you know that in about half of US states it is illegal to boycott Israel in some form and you could lose your job or business with the state if so? In AMERICA, this is happening - the country where the act of boycott is cherished in our history (see Boston Tea Party). Shit, I can say i boycott America and not get in trouble in the U.S. Lastly, Palestinians see the West Bank where militancy has died out and Hamas is not active and they see nothing but expanding settlements and more suffering. Netanyahu had truly thought he could ignore the Palestinians and manage them to be in constant subjugation and they would just go away.This what about-ism you talk of - regarding Israel‚Äôs neighbors being bad on human rights, it‚Äôs also another unproductive part of the narrative that is often used by the pro Israel camp. It‚Äôs irrelevant to the discussion we‚Äôre having. And as far as human rights, Israel is complete trash in that department. Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch, and even B‚ÄôTeslem (the most prominent Israeli human right org) have all affirmed in recent years that Israel practices apartheid against Palestinians. Even the Israeli Arabs have a long well-documented history of severe discrimination despite Israel loving to show them off. Israel passed the Nation Law state only a couple of years ago that dictated that only Jews have the right to self determination in Israel. That is not what a liberal, inclusive democracy has in its charters.I‚Äôm not sure what you need me to ‚Äúback up‚Äù - not that I‚Äôve seen you back anything up, but here is some literature I would recommend. I don‚Äôt expect you to actually check them out as you‚Äôre probably ingrained in your own biases but just in case:Ezra Klein podcast from last week on this conflict (this is the Spotify link but you can find others). The American Jews discuss the conflict in an unbiased manner, very insightful: https://open.spotify.com/episode/72YJpIeKAR0I9Qf528wPRs?si=dls4ag29TkuLjH0gHIASwAhttps://ifamericansknew.org/ - fact-based statistics and happenings about the conflict that aren‚Äôt reported in the USAmnesty on Israel‚Äôs apartheid: https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2022/02/israels-apartheid-against-palestinians-a-cruel-system-of-domination-and-a-crime-against-humanity/HRW on Israel apartheid: https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecutionHere are also some book recommendations if you really want to dig in. I would be wiling to buy any of these for you and sending them to you if you‚Äôll actually read it:1) The Hundred Years‚Äô War on Palestine - Rashid Khalidi2) An Oral History of the Palestinian Nakba - Nahla Abdo and Nur Masalha (technically not a book)3) Hama Contained - Tarek Baconi4) The Question of Palestine - Edward Said
[do I really have to bring out the report by NATO on the topic](https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/hamas_human_shields.pdf)
To make is a country it was the Jewish people.
It‚Äôs fair. Both acts are unjust and gross.
BM-21s were all in Ukraine, and the rusty BM-13s at the local warehouse wouldn't start.
But what if he's thinking 'damn, this turbine is really sexy, man.'
...source?
Some of these look like hellfire missiles or something similar.  Not jdams.
Lol Israeli bots saw the tank footage and had to say ‚Äúwhat about this‚Äù
That‚Äôs because hamas is a light infantry force with nothing but AKs and rpgs.  Idf wouldn‚Äôt be able to operate the way it does against a even slightly more armed/competent enemy.
Tbh most countries have their Gucci belt cities, so there are people with good life in most countries. But yes, poor people in poorer countries are often living a nightmare.
Agreed. EFPs and directional mines would still jack you up and all would be a threat to civilians.
Idk probably all the guns there‚Äôs clearly more plebs off screen with weapons   Could very well be a lot more.  And hamas coloring which if you know the area could be a quick indicator
Huh? Over half a million Arab and Persian Jews were ethnically cleansed or fled to Israel. There have always been Jews living in the Middle East and what is now Israel. There are 22 Arabs states but only one Jewish state. Give it a rest.
i wonder why the soldiers hasnt removed the silencer.  Warning-shots sounds a little bit weak with a silencer....
Probably, I had the same thought followed by, "At least they let the man run away," and then, "Oh this is from the attacks on the 7th."
Clearly a family dog :(
She showed us how she braves women that's awesome you showed we so weak we don't have humanality.
Yeah i have my grandma tombstone too, but the difference is i can provide footage of her funeral. The idf can't provide footage of them rescuing her.Let me repeat myself since you look like you're on the slow side.They can't provide footage of rescuing her, where's the footage of finding her in a house/tunnel and pulling her out exactly? Yeah nonexistent
Doesn't even have to involve a real plane. Some fake social media posts and injecting some bogus data into plane tracking sites would be all that is required.Or maybe when one of those Wagner planes lands.
If you have a better, cleaner way of killing literal child-beheaders without getting any of their civilian shields hurt then I'm sure the IDF would be happy to hear from you.
No need for an investigation. The millions of people living in Gaza are stupid to not have gone South. The people in the car were either Hamas or if not hamas, most probably hamas sympathizers and even if they weren't and were in all likelihood civilians it's on them for being there when Israel had so benevolently given them an ample 2 weeks notice to just leave their lives as they knew it to be refugees. Also, there is no way to know they weren't hamas for the tank personal. Hamas can very easily pretend to be civilians and have weapons hidden that the tank would've no way of knowing. Also, the car was seen reversing which would've alarmed the tank driver and the only reasonable thing to do when you see a car clearly going back out of your way is to kill some terrorists. Shalom, hope Israel kills all of the terrorists in North Gaza.
Considering Dagestan is a Muslim majority, very diverse region, either the Spetnaz have better culture compared to Chechen and Russians ethnics or the scumbags are the ones dragged to the war.
Thats not war. Gaza doesnt have a military they have a militia with no technology.
yes exactly
lol is this someones response to the israeli tank blowing up a civvy car?
How can you reasonably support Israel knowing that its existence is a settler-colonial apartheid nation state?
.ua has managed to build drones that look like a christmass-tree on the Radar.&amp;#x200B;They are intendet to get intercepted...
Prove it otherwise then :) they're getting fucked head over toes as we're speaking, just like what happened in 2014 a big miserable fail and it'll happen again
Rare Russian W. Apart from them having contributed to the situation in the first place, but still.
Fucking bastards! Thats not war thats an atrocity!
Yeah definitely, better touch some grass and see what's going on, a couple of Israeli news will of course support the idf, but everyone else even the us news which I'm even surprised by are saying and showing the truth for once"Idf had been spot on" yes sure hospital bombing was debunked by multiple sources.Hamas use of civilians, ah yes, lets make a hamas headquarters in the middle of gaza as if the idf isnt bombing EVERYTHING THEY SEE, and concluding it as a hamas target, lets check the ratio of kids being slaughtered next to hamas members, sick fuck
Their usual method seems to be gassing the hostages, but since at least a couple of them were Jews, that would just be beyond the pale.
You are correct sir, I have made the edit ü´°
Saying that its ukraines falt when they have openly supported Israel because one guy living in ukraine supported it is the same level of bulshit as Saying that azov makes ukraine a neo nazi state.
Oh is it now?
Sound like a good idea, except you're going to have an anti-mobilization riot on your hands. And if they let themselves be mobilized, you may have soldiers who are more loyal to Dagestan than to Russia.
They don‚Äôt care lmao. Israel literally created HAMAS.
The decoys from the storm shadow where intercepted not the actual missiles. Try harder next time Russians
There's footage of her reuniting with her family, we have her name, rank and position within the IDF. None of this is secret buddy.
Well, one of the social media accounts that promoted this shitshow, though it didn't have the original idea, was associated with a Russian exile rightwing extremist who lives in Ukraine. So there may be a grain of truth to this shitlord stoking the fires of inherent antisemitism for the funnies.
They‚Äôve just gotten worse at killing people.
Literally every single piece of information the IDF presented was confirmed by video and third parties. The initial massacre, the hospital bombing, Hamas use of civilians, you name it, so far the IDF has been spot on. Cope harder.
The fate of the Palestinian people in Gaza is in their hands. I agree they are not in an easy position.But 1st thing on their order of business should be throwing Hamas straight out of the door.As long as their leadership prioritizes eliminating Israel over prosperity of Gaza things will keep looking like this.Hamas have sold the Palestinian people the narrative that Israel is to blame for their misery.But the only reason they Gaza is blockaded and currently being bombed is because of Hamas and its terrorist activities.
I see 10-07 so this must have been footage from the initial attack in Israel. I wonder what the first guy saw and why he ran vs the van that got hit.
Trajectory is wrong for that hit ....More likely one was knocked out of the sky but the warhead/explosives fell straight down intact after interception.Doesn't make it better for the victims, but still.
I wonder what iron domes intercept rate is.
The Irony here is that Russia has been supporting Iran, Hezbollah and Assad online, and Israel certainly noticed this.
They are already trying to blame ukraine for this LOL.
Time on the video say it was on the 7th so it is an older video from the initial attack I assume.
Amazing how those little kids with rocks managed to kill 1,400 people and kidnap 239 more.Also, the 8,000 rockets shot over Israel - were those also just rocks?
Lmao true though, cause only officers can be pilots.
They were carrying "TOP SECRET" chemical manufacturing documents too
It's a crusader mindset.
I'm familiar with the basics of radio waves. He's saying the trigger would respond on any radio frequency which would clearly make no sense from a safety perspective. The jammer is blasting a wide range of frequencies, one of them being the frequency the radio triggers uses
Very interesting, thanks for sharing.Visually it's much closer to WWI or even the US Civil War than to WWII.
It just clicked, I got you. My bad. You're talking about a converter(you left that out btw). It did not read like that.  Yes that is an extremely and unnecessarily difficult way of detonating a bomb.  You do however need that converter as without it infrared signal is not going to RF.

I'm sorry, but from the start of the 7th of October the idf tried to twist the narratives plenty of times and they haven't succeeded most of the time, its already been rumored to shit since they aren't able or not willing to provide any further details, like they're pulling this talk out of thin air snd its not holding up at all

Pardon my Nostalgia but several years in Brazil working in the Aviation segment made me questionHow could a beautiful country with many great people seem to be stuck at (in comparison to human psychology)  fixation  at adolescent-post adolescent stage of development. I don‚Äôt pretend to know all the answers. What I learned from a Brazilian teaching Econ in my MBA program that  what the Toyota Corolla Index points to is high taxes,  corruption, poor public primary education, bloated public infrastructure all contribute to high prices and general stagnation.What‚Äôs interesting is that so many former Eastern European countries with similar history of unaffordable wealth transfer, corruption,  A Statist insufferable public sector could embrace reforms. Poland now has surpassed Portugal in GDP. Only took 25 years.I have thought a lot about what commonalities could explain the perpetual economic doldrums of the Lusosphere. I doubt the answer is electing a giraffe keeper, clumsy punch press operator as president. Fixation  with the color red seems to be detrimental on both sides of the Atlantic. I was sitting years ago in Brazil watching Joe Suarez who‚Äôs academic guest climbed up on his sofa and started screaming ‚Äú I hate the middle class‚Äù. How do some of these people even get a platform?

Yes, very much likely to contribute to the redevelopment of Gaza
1st I did not know this list existed.2nd I believe it is not official rather it has been put together by the news organization.As stated in the link you provided currently there are only 140 or so names they have *collected*Out of over 220 hostages.I live in the middle of the conflict as well FYI.Edit: its pretty absurd to think the IDF would lie about something this serious as it would ruin their credibility. And the IDF is considered credible unlike Hamas that have lost their credibility a long time ago.Even if they did try to lie they would never get away with it given Israel is a very small country and rumors get around fast.2nd Edit: I don‚Äôt know why you think the IDF will release footage of their operations just because Hamas leaders ask for it.
They should fuck with him by just running by him until the very last guy catches up, then turn around and throw a mob beating.
So they should send them to concentration camps like they do in China?
Lol thanks, that was great and wrong on so many levels
Are we pretending like israel isn't killing civilians as well?
‚ÄúQuietly evicting?‚Äù They [distributed guns to settlers](https://www.timesofisrael.com/distribution-of-300-assault-rifles-to-west-bank-civilian-security-squads-underway/) and turned a blind eye to [over a hundred reprisal killings in the West Bank](https://time.com/6327959/israel-west-bank-violence-grows/) and counting.

I went into it well aware that there was like 99% chance these people aren't real humans and are just propaganda accounts. Wadayagonna do
&gt; impressive they didn't just open fire on everybody around themEspecially since Dagestan is, to the best of my knowledge, majority Chechen. And if you search "Chechen Genocide" on Wikipedia, it answers ["which one?"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chechen_genocide) But um, I'm pretty sure most of the population of Dagestan lives there because Stalin did some ethnic cleansing after WWII when he accused Chechens and Tartars of being Nazis (they were not Nazis).  Also Putin came to power when he did a terrorist attack, framed it on Chechen terrorists, and then used the false flag terrorist attack as an excuse to invade Chechnya and commit genocide. If the Russian army decided to go to the Caucuses and fire machine guns into a crowd of civilians, I would not be surprised in the slightest.Anyway my point is that Russia sucks, and I'm somewhat disappointed in Chechens. As an eastern European religious minority that has faced centuries of persecution and genocide, I would expect Chechens to have a little more solidarity with their Jewish brothers and sisters. I'm the grandson of Ukrainian Jews and I certainly feel for the Chechens, and it bothers me that Chechens don't see that we're not so different (fuck the Tsardom, fuck the Soviet Union, fuck the Federation, Russia is a shithole and it has always been a shithole)... Although I guess that antisemitism is kind of the sixth pillar of Islam, isn't it?
Netenyahu:  ‚Äúwhoever is against a Palestinian state should be for‚Äù transferring the funds to Gaza, because maintaining a separation between the PA in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza helps prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.
i am not praying for Israeli troops going in to slaughter civilians
They told them to evacuate, but evacuate to where? To the nearest military zone to get killed anyway?
Oh yeah My bad
‚ÄúThat land was ours two thousand years ago and shall be again! The Palestinians? They lost that land *decades* ago, get over it!‚Äù /s
I'll see one video about jews being searched for by an angry mob, most likely hoping to kill the random jews that they find, and then this.It's just two extremes and if you'd dont agree with them you're evil.
Wow I totally read that as "Mile High Holes" and thought, that sounds interesting. Then I confirmed....and it was not.....thanks for ruining my ~~day~~ year
Agree it looks like Pantsir, but Pantsir is designed to intercept cruise missiles (among other things) so that doesn't suggest it must be targeting a drone. We've seen it used to engage Storm Shadow in the past, like in [this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/14nvjq4/pantsirs_antiaircraft_systems_tries_to_shoot_down/) (unsuccessfully in that case).
Least racist redditor
but but but we are the victims they hurt us with their broken buildings and dead kids
I know it‚Äôs not healthy, I know I shouldn‚Äôt but I would love to fup anyone who lays their hands on me.
This is a straight up Benny Hill chase
No. But it would receive refueling from there. KA-6, F-18 and the newer unmanned MQ25 (or a similar model) could provide refueling easy.The Rivet Joint is designed for long flights for sustained reconnaissance. Ever since Russia got involved in Ukraine they they've kept a few flying over Europe at all times.
Asking the real questions‚Ä¶
Taking hostages is not defending yourself.
It was hamas in that car. The terrorist sympathizers will say otherwise.
I would also add that I am extremely happy to see someone tie US war machine building to this conflict. So many have asked "Why would the world stand with Israel if they commit war crimes?" The answer is simple: Money and guns. We (the US) have too much invested in there to basically decide to oppose ourselves.
‚ÄúIt was my first day‚Äù defense.
The ole Hamas HQ bunker under the hospital animation made by the IDF, to justify the bombing of the hospital which they didn't do...Oh Israel...Why doesn't the IDF just stopping making ISIS manuals?!
I haven't seen any Oct 7th clips just the destruction onto Palestine afterwards seems more prominent
Pro Israel the people, but anti the genocidal government. Meaning I support an often marginalized race/ancient religious theology while opposing a murderous political regime with the same name. Again, not that complicated. Two things with the same name.
You mean the guy being held on first degree murder and a bunch of other charges that is being investigated by the DoJ for committing a hate crime? He's being held without bond right now. Don't make shit up and spread misinformation to push some agenda.
This is accurate. The jammer creates "noise" so the frequency is not seen as it should be by the receiver.
&gt; special forces"Very special forces"
That is peak Russia right there. If I had to summarize the last few months it would be that.
https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-22/ty-article-magazine/hostages-held-by-hamas-the-names-of-those-abducted-from-israel/0000018b-55f8-d5d2-afef-d5fdd04e0000Here's the list by israeli news, or maybe they're lying. :)Oh believe me I'm catching up more than you, living in the middle of the conflict, pretty sure I'd know what's going on(Her name was added after she was rescued)"Keep its opsec" lmao this is the dumbest thing I've heard all day, how would that break it if they showed footage of them rescuing her, or even clips? Would that show the fingernails of their soldiers? Or what exactly? Lol
Because it‚Äôs a state run news agency based in Turkey. Aka they suck  Erdogans pee pee Some sources in this category may be untrustworthy. See all Right Bias sources. Overall, we rate Anadolu Agency Right Biased editorially and Mixed factually due to poor sourcing. Further, this is an agency controlled by the right-wing ruling party and has a very strong pro-government state bias.
There is no cognitive dissonance in their argument and Gaza can absolutely be considered a concentration camp even if the population is growing. Population decline isn‚Äôt a condition of a concentration/ internment camps. That‚Äôs just something you made up.
We've been thru this. I'm too old.
The list of the hostages names hasn‚Äôt been published, its not even published today.You are spewing straight Hamas propaganda.Footage probably exists.My guess to why it isn‚Äôt being published is that the IDF wants to keep its OPSEC as the ground assault is still ongoing.By the way - Hamas changed its propaganda you might want to catch up.They are now admitting she was a hostage but they are saying they released her, not the IDF.
Anything could have been interecepted with these videos, heck could have been ua firing them, or even Ai generated
This is ATROCIOUS!!!!!!!!
Dude argues with the ref about his foul, which gets him the yellow card.  I don't think anyone needed the ref to raise a red card after that though.  Hope that team kicked that player off after that.
[https://netlinetech.com/about-us/](https://netlinetech.com/about-us/)  You need to google what a frequency is and what noise is when talking about them.  It's not literal noise. I do agree that I doubt their intent is to detonate them.  Jamming is the primary way I know of counter IED.  You'd still get fucked by EFPs and directional mines.
Why go all the way to Twitter when reddit has more than enough antisemitism
It's called C-Guard fyi.  I don't think they detonate them though. Jamming is usually the intent of counter IED systems.  EFP's and directional mines would still be dangerous.
they spend money on a protection system that saves lifes from terrorist attacks.how dare they
She threatened to pee on him lol, missed the opportunity to say ‚Äújokes on you, I‚Äôm into that shit‚Äù
RF jammers work by creating "noise" so a clear frequency can't be achieved.  I am not going to explain radio frequencies on here but it is not what that dude said.
The alpha legion would like to have a word with you
This is the perfect time to tell a joke that won't bite me in the ass at all.An old Jewish man dies and makes his way to heaven. While discussing his life, he cracks a holocaust joke.  "That's not funny" says God.  The man replies "Oh, sorry. Guess you had to be there."
  Stop spreading fake and misleading information &gt;The prime minister (Netenyahu) also said that, ‚Äúwhoever is against a Palestinian state should be for‚Äù transferring the funds to Gaza, because maintaining a separation between the PA in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza helps prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state.https://m.jpost.com/Arab-Israeli-Conflict/Netanyahu-Money-to-Hamas-part-of-strategy-to-keep-Palestinians-divided-583082
You haven't read my comment carefully. You can use the remote and transfer the signal via radio, by unplugging the IR light and sticking the transmitter instead.
Good. Let them suffer
The Ukrainian army has thousands of Stingers, igla, prior to war installed Soviet and post war installed Western anti-air military systems but always fun to see stupid people using 4 month old bot accounts to feel smart and brave.Run off back to your echo chamber of mouth breathers that cheer war crimes Israel commits and criticizes Russia when they do the same.
We all gotta work together to achieve this :) End Israel (no deaths necessary!!)
Wouldn‚Äôt the shadows be smokeless or is that the air defense.   I would think the air defense missles would be smokeless as well but Russia probably has burned through there good stuff.
Why when Hamas kills civilians like this do people turn to ‚Äúwell of Gaza was a free state or country this wouldn‚Äôt happen.‚Äù I call bullshit until someone can PROVE that there is a Gaza military, they wear uniforms like modern militaries, and treat civilians as civilians and not capture and murder them.  If someone can prove those things then you might sway me. I‚Äôve been to the Middle East. I‚Äôve seen that they do, this is terrorizing normal civilians. What Hamas would do if they didn‚Äôt kill these people and rape and to slaughter them would be keep them in good health and the right state of mind to turn over in a legit prisoner swap. Ant someone shows me that they are more than a terror group I can not blame Israel for their response. Someone one said ‚Äúwar is hell.‚Äù I believe General William Sherman or something. Civilians are going to have casualties until Hamas fights this like a moder DT war and not a terror group.
Correct, because they want to up the moral of their forces and shut u.the civilians, but in reality they barely can step in gaza for a couple of mins without being bombarded with bullets and rpgs, they're just doing this to post it on the news, more like publicity stunts
Soviet book for pioneer camp directors that my grampa gifted to me was hella great read, truth be told.It even had schematics how to make a catapult outta basically scrap materials, as well as schematics for two-staged solid-fueled rocket with recoverable payload section.
&gt; didn't even try to negotiateDo you genuinely believe there has been 0 negotiation
Dude no one has ever used an infrared signal to detonate an IED. Nor is that complicated, every prankster in highschool had a universal TV remote at one time. Not only do you have to point it directly(you are literally bouncing light off a piece of glass to another piece of glass) at what you are trying to operate, they don't go far and are effected by light. Complicated is using cell phones with a trigger wired into the circuitry, so instead of the phone vibrating it sends the charge to the detonator.  More complicated is using a multi-channel RF receiver, that is why US vehicles have cell jammers and RF jammers on them.  They just went to pressure plates or in the case of EFP's(thanks IRAN) laser-detonated ones, which are old-school IRA shit.  You can make one out of the things that keep garage doors from crushing things.The new age is WIFI.....
And where exactly is the footage of returning a hostage? It's just a claim to up the morals of their idf and to shut up the civilians lmao. They all have gopros and alot of drones, why isn't there any footage of them rescuing the hostage?Plus why they only added her name to the hostages after being rescued? Not before?
you forgot that he said ÿπÿßÿ¶ŸÑŸá ŸÉÿßŸÖŸÑŸá it was a full family
Is that as good as FLIR gets?   I was in the army in air defense and back then FLIR was the same size and resolution.  Seams like it would have approved by now.   In side note the FLIR unit on the side of the chappel missile launcher in which I worked on was huge.  Size of 2 big suite cases and now you can FLIR technology off Amazon that fits in your hand.
That‚Äôs their delivery of new ISIS combat tactics manuals, specifically the ones where they hide their HQ under a hospital.
Shoigu claims, but won‚Äôt provide any evidence. To be fair though, he could be talking about Russian jets downed by Russian AA‚Ä¶ about as likely‚Ä¶
First recorded use was by a Mexican cartel 2013-2014 but ISIS quickly picked up on it which would bring the first wide spread media coverage on the drone threat
The war is long from over and they haven't entered Gaza city proper yet. The death toll is abhorrent.
Hamas is in the west bank as well. That was the main point of my comment....
You see it was turning around in the video and they say there was a family in there.You can't just assume they are combatants unless fired upon or you see weapons.
First of all I‚Äôm not from Gaza, I don‚Äôt know why your calling hamas my brothers. Palestine has been terrorized for 75 years and when Palestine finally fights back babies start dying. Israel has killed way more civilians than hamas, yet no one talks about it.
Queue the Benny Hill music. üòÇ
Correction.  These are not ‚ÄúDefensive Forces‚Äù. These are OCCUPYING FORCES.  No one with eyes can call what is, and has been happening defense by any stretch of the imagination
Still dont see a reason why they would send the dozer to the west bank ? Likely stealing some houses for settlers
Which is great, not a lot of people have the courage to do that.
Nobody reported this , these pro-palestinians really try to be tough men but have severe inferiority problems .
Religious cults always suck
So the IDF orchestrated hamas coming to power knowing they would attack Israel so IDF could kill more palestinians and take more land ?
Yeah critical thinking bad
source for your claim?
They refuse to let civilians flee or evacuate in hopes that IDF will not bomb certain locations. Then IDF bombs those locations and kills civilians.
&gt;its reasonable to assume the car was filled with hamas fighters It wasn't. It was turning around and had a family in there. Case closed.
Also weird ass porn subreddits like one called "High Mileage Holes"
Say it was their fuel that blew up. Gaslight after lighting gas.
Netanyahu pretty much guaranteed a trump win.Only way I'd vote Biden now is military support for Palestine
It's not $100,000 but even if it was, in the last 3 years where there have been multiple conflicts with Hamas, even if 20,000 rockets were shot and intercepted (Iron Dome doesn't intercept rockets that are going to fall in unpopulated areas), that's 2 billion dollars over 3 years, which is a pretty small fraction of Israel's yearly military budget, considering how many lives would be saved by those 20,000 rockets not hitting civilian areas, I'd say it's definitely worth every penny and doesn't cost as much you think
You say it like it's a bad thing that we want to eradicate a terrorist organization...
it is a lot; however, its nothing compared to how it would be if israel was actually going for carpet bombing, genocide, or "parking lot" Gaza
They're writing paragraphs of justification for dropping thousands of bombs on civilians and somehow think that comparing it with a bunch of other horrific wars makes it ok. Sorry if I didn't respond intellectually enough for you :|
Disgusting apologia of dead civilians. Replace Gaza with Ukraine and Hamas with NATO and you have Putin's discourse.
Democrats really are useless. Every situtation is met with complete impotence.
They are smarter by virtue of not supporting Trump.
Good point
It's amazing thanks to Reddit that we only get once side of the conflict now
A stronger man than I. I couldn't even come close to imagining that kind of pain.
&gt;less than 7% of a city destroyedThat sounds like a hell of a lot, honestly. Almost every 14th building destroyed.
To be fair, they could be firing blanks. That video of a Russian police/military raid on illegal loggers in the Russian Far East from a few weeks ago showed the authorities blasting away until they received return fire. Then they back off, screw off the (presumably) blank firing adapter muzzle devices, and swap mags to live ammo.
hasnt that land along with much of the land around the mediterranean changed ownership and ethnic groups living there 10s if not hundreds of times since before recorded history?
I'm late for the party. Who downed 24 jets?I hope Ukraine.
No Sasha you turn gas knob that way!
And they made all kinds of legal ways to do it up and them made it law. This is the plan, all along. Kill, displace, replace, repeat, until there are no more Palestinians in Israel. And we're helping them. Fucking disgusting.
It's easy to hit militants when every person you hit is automatically considered a militant
Ghost of Gaza
That's Russian National Guard. It even says so in the description. Explains the lack of casualties.
Can a plane that large take off from a carrier?
Truly a job well done.
That's actually Hamas blowing up 3 hospitals and a kindergarten.- Ministry of Truth and Information.
Incorrect, zionism was built on the graves of Jewish people who endured multiple ethnic cleansings in eastern europe, and incalculable antisemitic scenarios in western europe.Unfortunately the worst and most extreme zionists won the floor. Is that so hard to understand- Hamas won in Gaza, Irgun and Haganah won for Israelis. If we can say Free Palestine can be rooted in a peaceful movement of natives living in their homeland, we can also say the same thing for Zionism. Unless you don't believe that jews are native to Israel. We should be disavowing the extreme rhetoric of both sides and be advocating for a peace that doesn't call for genocide or ethnic cleansing for anyone.
The birds have to deal with stupid barbaric humanity and their issues.
they don't lie for us, they lie for their own population
The Israeli footage has been extremely unremarkable to me. I suppose they really don't want to give anything away, but it's just these rapidcut montages of blurry buildings being destroyed without any context, or a few snippets of tanks and soldiers walking around.
Ukrainian army would disagree‚Ä¶ there is something to be said for courage and standing up ‚Ä¶ and fighting and not hiding like rats‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm glad you find it so fucking funny.
I don't think hamas has good snipers if any at all
Yeah, that makes sense. Should've at least checked where the place is on the map before throwing in my 2 cents on the clip...
War crime
Shhhh‚Ä¶ there were only 500 casualties when Israel was falsely being blamed for it. Now that it‚Äôs confirmed it was the other Palestinian terrorist group who did it, the casualties can slide down to dozens. But don‚Äôt forget that it‚Äôs still Israel‚Äôs fault because they *TOTALLY* would have done it otherwise. üôÑ
The song goes hard tho
There is nothing "to be done" about Hamas. They are a radical organization that exists out of protest to horrific living conditions of the cage they're forced to live in. The solution to Hamas is to improve the lives of Palestinians such that they don't turn to radicalization.Every child who has their legs blown off by an IDF bomb causes 5 more Palestinians to curse the existence of Israel.The "middle" is telling Israel to put the fucking guns down and stop the oppression.Of course a start would be to allow proper democratic elections in the region. Fatah was polling at like 40% (which would have given them leadership, maybe even a majority) in 2020, but Israel refused to allow Arabs in Jerusalem to cast votes. Basically removing any urban element to the vote. Had the election run, it would have almost certainly gone far-right to Hamas or the PIJ (as most rural communities do). Israel likes that Hamas is in power because it gives them the excuse to treat all Palestinians like rabid violent terrorists.
No, that is very reductive. Zionism is merely the belief that jews should be able to live in israel without persecution. No need for expansion, apartheid, genocide or ethnic cleansing.
The only terrorists in the West Bank are the Israeli settlers who are enabled by the IDF. From this year alone:- [UN: Since 7 October, our Office has received reports that 69 Palestinians, including at least 15 children and one woman, have been killed by Israeli security forces in the occupied West Bank.

They could probably jog for longer than he could ride the bike. It's like modern persistence hunting.
Listen I‚Äôm on your side here, but in that case I believe the man was arrested and is being held on multiple charges. Recently pleading not guilty to them and is awaiting sentencing.Edit:I said he plead guilty, he in fact pleaded NOT guilty
Oh, indeed, but it removes even the possibility of some annoying third party from acting the hero you know, which is important!
Thanks for your reply here and the continued discussion.I appreciated the discussion also about eliminating Hamas vs. their capability/leadership...  and the likelihood they would just recruit more.
You too?
I was thinking more of they/someone else had encountered the group before and were conveyed the information.
Well luckily the Russian government refused to tell first responders what the theater had been dosed with so treatment was impossible anyway :)
Civilian?
That's how I feel about "pro-Palestinians" who offer no ideas on what to do about Hamas or the constant, actual dangers of Gaza while only saying Israel shouldn't exist.There's a place somewhere in the middle, honestly.
Only ever their own.
Given that the paulistas, with their industries and the mineiros, with their mineral wealth basically shared power throughout the whole old republic, i dont see how this war ending differently would bring about the outcome you mentioned when decades of rule failed to bring it about in the first place.And as brazilians, we shouldnt bemoan what could have been had something been different 91 years ago but instead be proactive and look at how we can improve our nation going forward
‚ÄúShould‚Äôve been born elsewhere smh skill issue‚Äù
Capabilities are a universal language- if aliens invaded with powerful lasers, we wouldn't try to translate one word, but reverse engineer there weapons on speed dial. Which is why everyone and his dog, will have ukraines drone boats within the year. Shitty times to be a ship, a navy or anything with large easily attacked infra.  Next stage.. drone carrying drone-boats.. sort of like mini carriers..
Personally I think the mod accounts were purchased by professional media relations firms, I am unclear whether reddit itself gets a cut.  They seem to push the same messaging as the western MSM. But is interesting now that other players are in the game. If you want some cheap karma, get into a china post defending china.
Thanks very much for your reply. That helps.
This whole thing is just a dumpster fire.
Thanks for recipe. I will be making (censured) now, fill them with flechettes and fire them on ruzzians.
That's where I stole it from lmao
Pretty sure it *is*.
He tired to respect Hamas as an organization. That proved to be a mistake. You cannot negotiate with people who believe savagely murdering civilians is a righteous way to resist. To believe that these actions will help in any way. Hamas didn't want Israel to have any agreement with Saudi Arabia. They were successful and can now die martyrs. 40 Virgins are waiting. Enjoy.
What an asinine statement
"As someone who is pro slavery but not racist towards black people..."
Killing fleeing enemies is not a war crime. Context matters.
I guess? Seems a bit like Schrodinger's cat for the tank operators... Are they civilian or militant? Both, until we actually take a look. Oops, guess they were civilian the entire time!
Indeed. The genius of the [Firehose of Falsehood](https://www.rand.org/pubs/perspectives/PE198.html) Surkov-style propaganda would not have been possible without the Internet. Russia is innovating in assholery.
Jeez. That makes it 560 shot down in just the last week!
To play both sides against to each other. Ever heard of Art of War? Apparently those Israelis generals did.
Where did he get this information from? I‚Äôve never heard of this and want to look into it more.
Qwheat being a downer bro
&gt; Huh, that seems oddly similar to the concept of The Pale in British controlled Ireland. I wonder if the terms are related?In Russian, the word used was more closer to **line** of settlement.When translated to English, they picked a better-suited word.
Here‚Äôs why they were attacking the bulldozer https://x.com/hanine09/status/1718859508691226703?s=46&amp;t=09GNuDt72Idwo6AdjdQxSg
This was my point for the post
"Leave the ancestral home we've spent 70 years trying to ethnically cleanse you from, we promise we won't put Jewish settlers all over like we did everywhere else you left"
It‚Äôs provocative
Asymmetry of power is very common in war. Look at drones dropping grenades on helpless soldiers in trenches. Or just direct airstrikes on soldiers who are not actively in combat. Context matters, you can't just assume things and go with it.Also, I am pretty sure it's always innocent until proven guilty, also when it comes to war crimes. For this to be a war crime the occupants would either have to be civilians or hors de combat:A combatant is hors de combat if:- he is in the power of an adverse party- he clearly expresses an intention to surrender- he has been rendered unconscious or is otherwise incapacitated by wounds or sickness, and is therefore incapable of defending himselfNone of which seem to be the case, since I am pretty sure a power imbalance is not being "in the power of an adverse party". If you have any references saying otherwise, please let me know.In general, it makes sense that you can kill fleeing enemies without repercussions, because you don't  want them to  regroup and attack you another day.
Pogroms are
It's the horseshoe theory of vexillology
Will Israel support hamas coming to power  in the west bank like he did in gaza ? Why did they do that ? https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/
[? Totally rational response](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peKQ33hCZ1U)
I'm sorry but have you seen gas prices lately? We're already paying 4$ a gallon over here, if Israel flushes 500 million gallons down the drain then I'm voting we annex them based on how we generally behave when someone threatens our oil prices.
Those numbers can't be trusted.  Everyone knows they cry wolf. If it is, well they were warned that they were going to pay a heavy price ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The best part is it‚Äôs so potent that typical anti-agents have insufficient binding affinity to displace it from the receptor, so you aren‚Äôt going to be saving any hostages! So efficient!
Why make this about her physical appearance and not about her xenophobic attitude though?
&gt;Akshually a T-72 was used. Because 125mm HE is just the thing for hostage rescue operations.This sounds like something straight outta Bosnian Ape Society videos, but then again, it's Russian Spetsnaz we're talking about.
that u have killed about 8 thousand people in Gaze?
This does not surprise me. But let‚Äôs not throw all Israelis under the bus‚Ä¶that privilege is reserved exclusively for Zionists.
I'd be totally fine if a plane with ruzzian officials were targeted.
Needs benny hill music.
That's just how names are randomly generated for reddit, it's always two words and some numbers.
&gt;What does Hamas want ultimately? I don't know considering Netanyahu supported them it's bets you ask him or his party &gt;If Hamas, which whom you are supporting, had a choice, would they choose an agreed upon peaceful two state solution, or all Jews were killed? I would never support any group that has been propped up by extremists like Netanyahu . Although I would have the same question about the Israeli government , why has Netanyahu always spoken out against the two state solution while actively carrying out ethnic cleansing?
HAMAS has been the de facto governing body in the Gaza Strip since 2007, when it ousted the Palestinian Authority from power. Primarily in Gaza; also maintains a presence in the West Bank; Palestinian refugee camps in Lebanon; and key regional capitals, such as Doha, Qatar, and Cairo, Egypt.https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;source=web&amp;rct=j&amp;opi=89978449&amp;url=https://www.dni.gov/nctc/ftos/hamas_fto.html%23:~:text%3DHAMAS%2520has%2520been%2520the%2520de,the%2520Palestinian%2520Authority%2520from%2520power.%26text%3DPrimarily%2520in%2520Gaza%253B%2520also%2520maintains,Qatar%252C%2520and%2520Cairo%252C%2520Egypt.&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiLlaOOxp6CAxU5tokEHcpGCxMQFnoECAwQBQ&amp;usg=AOvVaw19zy9dUFuWKDQuG3NV3FB4Edit: also, they use big dozers like that to clear the roads of IEDs, landmines, or any other booby traps.

&gt; What really amazes me is just how little of an effect it had on the crowd. If this happened where I live, everyone would've bolted the moment they heard a single gunshot - nevermind continuous full-auto bursts - but these guys were practically chilling. Full-auto bursts into the air are [a fine Dagestani tradition](https://eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/44011).&gt;Some social network users react positively to the custom. "It's okay; **weapons have long been part of our life**!" Vagab Abdusalamov wrote in the Facebook. At the same time commentators with Russian surnames treat the custom as savagery.
[According to this investigation](https://thegrayzone.com/2021/06/09/israeli-home-thief-long-island-financial-fraudster/), those reports were likely a case of mistaken identity. Yaakov Fauci is still a massive piece of shit tho, as the article concludes. Maybe he was still running from something, even if it wasn't fraud.
This has been going on for decades. But when Palestinians finally have enough and retaliate, Israel screams to the world, 'Why are they doing this to us? We did nothing'.
Throwing plastic garbage bins. These idiots need to upgrade their tactics.
Zionists are terrorists
What‚Äôs that flair look like? Is 4 or 5 war crimes the bare minimum?
Are they still going?
Again, if the IDF wanted to demolish homes in the West Bank, they would. If you believe there is zero Hamas support in the West Bank, then you and I will just have to disagree. I believe the bulldozers are a means of destroying stronghold positions. Israel is tired of sitting back and waiting for another attack. Not this time.
&gt;  the spetnaz operators are just magdumping into the sky like they're at an arab wedding partyThey're magdumping like they're at a [**Dagestani** wedding party](https://eng.kavkaz-uzel.eu/articles/44011). Because they're Dagestanis. In Dagestan.

Is their leader running for president? Did he promise to pardon them? Is he the frontrunner? Just wondering
We sure could use that almost 10 billion a year.
I'm just amazed that they're still doing it. You'd think they'd realise the ONLY way this is going to stop being a bloodbath for them is to start admitting shortcomings so they can work around them. Then again, they do always say to not interrupt your enemies when they're making mistakes, even when the mistakes are the same ones repeatedly and now you're just a tiny bit concerned about their mental state.
By that same standard since hamas is illegal  in Israel they could have more popularity then Netanyahu &gt;We don't know much one way or the other.Right ?
You cannot still hold the Health Ministry as reliable when they are still using their original 500 death toll for the hospital incident
Muslims have a very different take on this.  God is not unjust and we are meant to all return to Him.  We hope the people in the white car are accepted as martyrs and so they are already in a much better place.So for a Muslim, God did two things.  He returned to Himself those whose test is complete.  They are well taken care of.  And then for us He dropped the mask on all those who wish to whitewash Zionists and Israel of the blood on their hands.It probably seems weird to westerners hearing such language from Palestinians but I hope you understand a bit more than before you read my comment.  At the very least it gives them hope in the very pit of despair they live in.

&gt;What's the difference between "–ñ–µ–Ω–µ–≤—ã" and "–ñ–µ–Ω–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–µ"? It's the difference between "**Geneva's** proposals** and **Geneva proposals**.In the first case, it's **Geneva** that's proposing. In the second, we're talking about proposals associated with Geneva (written in Geneva, in this case).&gt;Also, why was one behind "suggestions" and the other in front of "conventions"?The OP was making a joke that to Russians, Geneva Conventions are more like Geneva *Suggestions* (because they seem to deliberately do things that the Convention prohibits).So they typed "Geneva Suggestions" into Google Translate, and that was the result.
I didn't assert anything. I just said context matters and it is one of the possibilities.
"Brainwashed" that's a funny word. Last I checked you'd do the same shit if israel wiped out your whole family.
&gt;If Hamas, which whom you are supporting, You are embarrassing yourself and putting words in the other user‚Äôs mouth.This video is from the West Bank. Israeli is attacking Hamas in the Gaza Strip. That‚Äôs because Hamas has power in Gaza, but the West Bank.Asking why Israel is sending bulldozers for settlement building in the West Bank does not equal support for Hamas that os in power in Gaza.
I realized now you aren't interested in having actual fruitful discussion with relavant context, just arguing for the sake of arguing so feel free to go about your day and argue about semantics without actually contributing anything useful. Judging from the amount of DV you got from every your comments replying to others, i suspect you aren't exactly socially tuned talking to others but defaulted to everyone misunderstood you instead of the other way around, but hey to each their own.

&gt;It means something like ‚Äúthe Geneva proposals‚Äù**Geneva's Proposals** more closely. Which has a subtle subtext to it, like Geneva is an entity that puts out the proposal.

Again, you sound lost. Yes. Tunnel fighting = guerrilla warfare. This is not up for debate. That is literally the only point I am making. You are arguing over something I have never stated.Guerrilla warfare might involve civilian casualties, and it might not. It doesn‚Äôt change the definition of guerrilla warfare. Either you are putting words in my mouth, or you are hearing things. Take meds, or reread what I wrote previously with some level of thinking capacity, please.
Putin respects Judaism and Islam as important religions in Russia and he is fine with the ethnic diversity as long as he is in charge, there is nothing unusual about this action. But Jews just got ethnically cleansed from yet another place. A place that is technically part of Europe. Right now in October 2023.

&gt; IMO the thing that breaks the symmetry is obvious: the large-scale terror attack by Hamas. Of course you can (and should) look further back in time and come up with an understanding other than "these people are evil and hate Israel for no reason so they deserve whatever they get." But that direct violent attack by a group that many people do not identify with is short-circuiting some empathy and understanding.Not as much as you think. This is the reason Putin put out so much media content on "Constant Ukrainian shelling of the Donbas" before the war, and attempts to push the social media narrative of "Ukrainian nazis committing genocide" When actually, all of the artillery duels leading up to the war were started by Russia and Ukrainian counterbattery fire was directed at Russian guns in self defense. But it's easy to shift the camera lens by cropping the first shot so the shot in self defense looks like an attacker. Ofc Hamas actually really did attack Israel, but the key is Putin at least felt the need to create a fake outrage to form a Casus Belli (This is btw why Biden was sounding the alarm for months and putting out tons of normally classified intel, to break up the Russian narrative)
There's a million things to do these about before doing one for a terror org that just raped and pillaged their was through multiple towns and committed all kinds of atrocities. This is pretty fucking distasteful.
What are you saying? They don't teach you to take off your helmet and hit a dude with it in the green berets or the SAS?
Lying is their resting position. It's their nature.
Iran is known to provide funding, training and weapons to Hamas as well as to Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group. U.S. officials have said they have not seen evidence of Iran's direct involvement in the Oct. 7 attack. "We are not looking for bigger wars,"
You mean new or just enough karma to post? Yep.
&gt;Probably either a sign of just how determined the people are that tried to kill those Jews, or that they are used to it.Why not both? Having anything wrong with your life and blaming it on jews, name a more iconic duo.

Civilian death count in Ukraine is about the same, after 600 days of war, than the civilian death count in Palestine after a couple weeks. Let that sink in.
The funny thing is if you scroll down in new posts you can tell all of these posts are getting deleted left and right. So they're posting this just for it to get removed quicklyIf you also look at the profiles of the average poster of each side you get the idea what's going on.
So you solely fixated on tunnel fighting = guerrilla warfare and not at all taken in the relevant context of how Hamas is waging this so called twisted guerrilla warfare at cost of Palestinian civilian lives by design from the get go as the way these tunnels are built. These issues are clearly interlinked, but you just decide to conveniently separate them out. Context matter here.  No guerrilla warfare dictates using civilian lives as deliberate collateral as you wage guerrilla fighting from wherever. But hey, feel free to perform whatever mental gymnastic so you feel you are somehow correct.
üáÆüá±
Its honestly a good tactic. If you kill every hostage once noone will ever take any more hostages.
&gt;It is devastating to see people desensitized by ongoing wars around them. They all accepted death. An eye for an eye really makes the whole world blind.Apparently something about one of the bots removing comments with accounts below a specific amount of karma
Why not food and water in exchange for weapons?
Why did you assume everyone here is american
They would say that, considering that sub is a bunch of Israel shills.US troops in Iraq had stricter RoE.
Don't be silly, mother Russia would never use anything as dangerous as Fentanyl on their own people. They used Carfentanil, it's ~100 times more potent than Fentanyl and ~10,000 times more potent than morphine, useful as a elephant tranqiliser I believe.
Well yea, and likewise, the US isn't backing Ukraine for humanitarian purposes either. Humanitarian would involve backing both Ukraine and Palestine.
*And free the hostages. It reads as they are there to eliminate them too lol
Sure. And there were 500 casualties when a misfired rocket hit a hospital parking lot.
Russia and USSR have been pretty good historically at supporting oppressed people around the globe and being on the morally correct side. Not in europe though, can't lose those satellite states. But africa, asia and south america? Yeah, they've been fucking awesome in supporting and arming anti-colonialist independence fighters
I think you're right. At 2:19, the "rocket" is removed from the RPG. It looks like the shot came from outside of the frame (right side).
they just want to pretend we‚Äôre all white so they can dehumanize us and compare us to British settlers, you‚Äôre not gna win this argument against these people. they just want another excuse to single out Jews
Ok It appears that I misunderstood the subtext of your comment.Regardless - I stand behind my words, the war‚Äôs objective is to eliminate hamas‚Äôs military (and after revisiting the speeches i add: leadership) capabilities. Edit: And free the hostages.
&gt; There is no hamas in the west Bank?We don't know much one way or the other.  Both Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have suspended elections for well over a decade.  There is genuine worry that Hamas has way more support in the West Bank than Palestinian Authority wants to admit.

Now Israelis are forcing Palestinians to give confession videos. All it does is make the Ukrainian ones look bad in retrospect, even though Russian troops committed tons of war crimes.
Well percentage wise it would be the equivalent of 20k Americans dying on 9/11. So yeah, we retaliated for what was proportionally far less and had the backing of the world. But Israel can't because there is structural antisemitism.

Yeah those guys are acting like they were the IDF; rounding up innocent people and interrogating them just because they belong to the "wrong" ethnic group.  If it makes you feel any better you can pretend that they are the IDF carrying out a raid in the West bank. If you want I can attach some pictures of dead children from Gaza , that way you can believe they were successful in there operation....
Israel can do whatever they want because they won multiple wars. Simple as that.
I have no idea how anyone could convince themselves what Israel is doing is morally right.  Fucking sickening.  Genocide plain and simple.
–ñ–µ–Ω–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–µ is nominative plural adjective, while –ñ–µ–Ω–µ–≤—ã is genitive singular noun form of the word.More literally translated, –ü—Ä–µ–¥–ª–æ–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –ñ–µ–Ω–µ–≤—ã would be more like Suggestions of Geneva, while –ñ–µ–Ω–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–µ –ö–æ–Ω–≤–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∏ is more or less Geneva Conventions (although, I suppose one could argue that it is more like Genevan Conventions, but I digress, I'm not a translator and in any case you would just write Geneva Conventions if you were translating).
Oh btw do you know how many UN workers were killed in this supposedly humanitarian operation? Or UN is also Hamas now?
What does Hamas want ultimately? What would be praised as the ultimate goal? If Hamas, which whom you are supporting, had a choice, would they choose an agreed upon peaceful two state solution, or all Jews were killed?
lmao it's a telephoto lense, but that made me laugh pretty hard thinking it was some weapon
I would understand a few psychopaths not having any sympathy towards the lives of others, but lately I‚Äôve been seeing all these videos with huge groups completely dehumanising the Palestinians, I thought kindness was more popular than hate.
You're honestly funny with that trust in IDF. Al Jazeera reported at least 10 days ago that roof bombing is not a rule anymore. And before you say It's a Hamas TV just ask yourself why Israel doesn't want any other media inside and why only Israel considers it non legitimate. Also ask yourself  why it's targeting Al Jazeera journalists (bombing Al Jazeera and Associated Press building without any evidence that Hamas was using it, killing Shireen Abu Akleh by Israeli sniper and now bombing the family of Wael Ah Dahdouh and countless others).

Israel needs to control the narrative to keep American public blind.  If the realities in Gaza &amp; West Bank and of the occupation hit American viewers, the blank (political/monetary) checks will dry up.  Those they can‚Äôt intimidate, they kill.   Why do you think Israeli government is trying to buy off young social media ‚Äúinfluencers‚Äù with hard cash.
No, I was just trying to highlight the cognitive dissonance in your argument.&amp;#x200B;It can't be a concentration camp if the population is growing lmao unless your point was how "bad" of a concentration camp it is?
I bet someone will learn this is the new swatting. How long before people start regularly calling Dagestan or some other country and falsely claiming there‚Äôs Israelis in some building? Then they sit with their popcorn and wait for the riot videos to come out.
Is it just me, or do I see the rocket still on the RPG when he put it down after shooting?
They aren't just going to capture it and leave.
Thank you, this is what I‚Äôve been personally working through. I‚Äôm not the most educated but I‚Äôve been trying to educate myself as best possible on this. There‚Äôs a lot of pressure from both sides to support one or the other but since doing some research my only conclusion is I‚Äôm not in support of either.My support doesn‚Äôt go to one side or the other it goes towards those who are innocent on both sides. The civilians of both countries are who really need our support.
That's a convenient excuse used by zionists to carry out ethnic cleansingHamas has carried out no military action out of the West bank but Israel has been constantly attacking.
No,the IDF made an announcement that they believe Hamas has a base underneath the largest hospital in Gaza, and that they intend to bomb it. The proof they provided was a 2008 era CGI mockup of what they think the underground base looks like. No photos, not recordings, nothing. Literally fucking fanfiction to justify blowing up a hospital with thousands of people sheltering inside it

So Redditers are focusing on Dagestani but not even focusing on this.
Mental gymnastics says: - meandering in tunnels is a human right- the tunnels did not consent to petroleum breeding- the tunnels are actually a highly advanced form of public transportation and Israel destroyed it as a war crime- using gas for non-automotive purposes violates some obscure international law- the tunnels are literally made of civilians including reinforced children for the rebar- Israel actually built the tunnels, it has nothing to do with Hamas, but that still doesn‚Äôt mean Israel is allowed to use the tunnels- the tunnels are sentient living beings capable of feeling pain- the tunnels don‚Äôt exist, they never existed, it‚Äôs a red herring, a dog whistle for petroleum extremism
What's the difference between "–ñ–µ–Ω–µ–≤—ã" and "–ñ–µ–Ω–µ–≤—Å–∫–∏–µ"? Also, why was one behind "suggestions" and the other in front of "conventions"?
Are you serious? You cannot simultaneously be a Zionist and pro Palestinian. Zionism was built on the graves of slaughtered Palestinians. The fact that you assume the worst, that they are supporting Hamas, speaks volumes. She had absolutely no justification for assaulting people exercising their first amendment right to freedom of speech.
When you‚Äôre white and an israeli supporter, you can do no wrong. It‚Äôs always hamas‚Äôs fault anyway. The world needs to wake up to how disgusting israelis treat non white israelis, let alone arabs and palestinians. The reason I say non white israelis is because they say and do some of the most racist, disgusting things to black jews in israel. Look it up. Plenty of videos proudly posted by israelis on youtube and other social media.
yeah, it's definitely this one. Thank you!

A perfect example of someone who was brought up to believe on kind of truth, did the ACTUAL research and sees the ‚Äútruth‚Äù for what it is - a bunch of BS propaganda spoon fed to Jews around the world (notably in the US). Stoked she had the foresight to educate herself early on and not take the lies as truths. Need to see more people like this because like myself, we were taught a false narrative of history (much like the history of the United States) and that false history needs to die and we as a citizens of the world ALL need to wake up.
The west needs brown slaves. That's basically why.
Makes it incredibly easy to spot someone from the outside.Snipers from what I understand, are generally trained to fire from inside the room so their barrel isn't poking out as a "shoot me" sign.

Russians With Attitude were already tweeting (Xitting?) exactly that...
I came to the comments to ask...thank you!
I wonder why ALL the comments got removed.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Looks like a bulldozer from some post-apoc future
90% of the fighting is IDF fighter jets and tanks, not much to shoot back at. Hamas will do what you always do against a superior equipped force, wait for occupation and insurgency.
That actually gives me some relief. At least 532 of us (at the time of this comment) aren't entirely brain dead. Thats pretty good considering humans are getting more and more stupid every day, if what we are reading and watching these days are any indications of that trend.
I say it as Israeli officials say it. I was correcting what was said above me. Which part exactly implies it's a bad thing? Don't try to spin it into something that it isn't.
Capturing Gaza doesn't mean anything, the US captured Baghdad in less than a month. It's the occupation that'll be the problem or if they plan to leave soon after, Hamas will refill their ranks within a week of the population coming back to a completely ruined and still blockaded city.
not that it changes anything about how horrible this is, but this is years old. nothing new here
You made the comparison in the first place dumbass lmao.

Least competent Spetsnaz
No one is challenging the narrative? I don't know where you have been buddy, but that seems to be what everyone and their mother has been doing these past views weeks. There are protests all across the United States, within the government, and around the world denouncing Israel. You aren't brave or an independent thinker. You claim Israel has shown zero regard for human life you say and I am being displaying cognitive dissonance/brainwashed? Oh the irony. What do you call it when Hamas butchers men, women, and children and livestreams it on Facebook live? What do you call it when you turn humanitarian aid and civilian infrastructure into weapons and brag about it in propaganda videos? What do you call when you use protected sites (hospitals and schools) as military bases and launch rockets at civilian centers from apartment complexes? What do you call it when you prevent your own people from attempting to leave a warzone? Israel is far from innocent, but they have made concerted efforts to minimize civilian casualties throughout this conflict, while Hamas has done the exact opposite. You sit here on your high horse and expect Israel to care about Palestinian civilians more than their own government, yet ignored how those efforts are undermined left, right, and center. Hamas is the enemy of Israel as well as their own people.Israel was attacked by Hamas, likely to thwart the Israeli-Saudi cooperation. This wasn't some wholesome fight for freedom, it was an excuse to kill Jews at the behest of Iran. Do you agree Israel has the right to destroy Hamas? Do you agree Hamas should be destroyed? Counter terrorism, especially in a dense urban environment, is about the most brutal type of fighting there is in modern combat. Civilian causalities are expected (and yes it's horrible), but that is not the same as intentionally targeting them. When else in human history has force been expected to supply their enemy? Still, Israel would still do if the hostages were released. You present such a one-sided depiction of this situation without any of the nuances that comes with this region. You act as if everyone around Israel recognizes and upholds humans rights, when they clearly do not. Do any of Israel's neighbors have a Jewish population? 21% of Israel's population is Arab. I have no ties to Israel and I willing to criticize them when they do wrong. However, you have not provided any evidence to support your claim so I would advice you to keep your ignorant accusations to yourself unless you can back them up.
The schools that Hamas is firing rockets from? Sure hope they do.
We don't know for sure, but the major goals are likely to isolate the Hamas strongholds from the rest of the strip, which were irresponsibly built right under hospitals.  They will completely cut off those main strongholds from the rest of the tunnel network and surround them and then cut off all food, water, fuel, etc. from getting in.  Then they can either smoke them out or just wait for them to surrender or come out for one last stand.  In the interim, they will make arrangements to hand over control of the strip to a civilian government.
Yes there have been several speeches of Israel‚Äôs PM saying they will eliminate Hamas.And if Israel could eliminate Hamas - they would. But realistically you wont be able to reach every last one of them who have access to an AK47.And even if they did, the Idea of Hamas won‚Äôt die because the Gazans are (for a lack of a better word) brainwashed, and Hamas would be rebuilt.This is why when asked about the primary objectives of the war Israels officials have responded with the 2 I have mentioned above.P.S - you say they want to eliminate Hamas like its a bad thing. Hamas are a bunch of low life terrorists who openly declare their goal is to eliminate Israel and the jewish people.

this subreddit is turning into a hate group. Sad to see so many people turn into Nazis. A sad sad sad day. Im out of here. Fuck all of you.
Freedom fighters murdering and raping. "Palestine" is getting what it deserves. Hope to see them take their rightful place as  part of the dirt that shit heap is built upon

Hamas Official Mousa Abu Marzouk ina TV interview: The Tunnels in Gaza Were Built to Protect Hamas Fighters, Not Civilians; Protecting Gaza Civilians Is the Responsibility of the U.N. and Israel.
yeah all the civilians and schools too
You realize that hamas is a direct result of Isreal imperialism? Land snatching and pushing people from their homes because they feel entitled. There is some evidence of Isreal even indirectly funding Hamas because they know that the more damage hamas does that it will "justify" their genocide in their eyes. What right do they have to take these people homes and businesses please tell me?
They kill the hostages for two reasons: 1. No hostages = no leverage from the hostage-takers. Checkmate westoids2. No hostages = no witnesses to claim that the hostage-takers all seemed to be FSB operatives
&gt;What can a car do unless it had explosives in it Even a bunch of explosives wouldn't do much to a modern main battle tank. To destroy an MBT you'd need specifically designed armor piercing anti-tank missiles or shells.   Some C4 in a car won't be enough, since the whole point of armored vehicles is to withstand regular munitons and explosions.
So true. Can we talk about anything else?
I would comment, but obviously the mod doesn‚Äôt want anyone commenting‚Ä¶
Guess they're smart enough to not stand in a field when the IDFs military experience from the last 50 years as been to fire hellfires from their jets while their army watches from picnic chairs.
Given the precision of these munition and slow travel speed of the camera, is it fair to assume hellfires from helis or laser guided Jdams?Also, Do IDF have spectre gunships?
Considering the area should be cleared and we can‚Äôt see who is inside or the thing that shot it then we basically know nothing.
Killed 3500 children in ouctober 2023Hamas or Israel?
jews and gas???
If any other country incurred 1500 horrific deaths by terrorist action in one day, I think people would be understanding of a retaliative response for that horror. But it‚Äôs Israel, so people get all up in their opinions about it. Am Yisrael Chai.
To be fair we blame everyone liberal equally.  As a side note Trump supporters like latinos - they work and have good family values.  We equally like asians as well - same dynamics.  We dislike white liberals the most, usually these are the upper middle class suburban people who think that they don't fart and are smarter than everyone, they tend to work for a government entity of some sort.
west bank illegal settlers? thats breaking international law, among other things
Eliminate Hamas, not it's capabilities. Can you guys stop finally spinning what they are saying. Every major news organisation is reporting it, yet Redditors somehow repeat it as "only their capabilities"...
this is what hamas said after their attack you dummy
Which is funny since good ol' Benji himself is responsible for funding hamas back at its grass roots stage in an attempt at divide and conquer. And look how it's turned out.
Every sub is Israel/Hamas.This is not r/publicfreakout material.
Black Hebrew Israelites are such a joke. Just like every other hate group out there. Bunch of losers.
Maybe you  an explain tunnels for Hamas fighters...
I'm sure they were 100% sure they were Hamas. And killing is always preferable to anything else. /sCapturing or giving the benefit of the doubt to investigate further is just for people that cares about not committing war crimes. Kill anything that moves, "they are just rats after all".
Those FT-17 tanks are adorable.
palestinians gotta shit, blame hamas for tearing them up if you like but european aid to civilians is much needed for the millions in gaza

&gt;they live in a completely different world. You get downvoted simply for not being genocidal there.
The IDF hasn't been in a real war in like 50 years, all their recent wars have been 90% their air force against enemies with no anti-air weapons.
Because for some reason, everyone got caught up in trying to appease others feelings. Those feelings are not facts. Yet these peoples feelings are their moral compass in life.

They said "a whole family" too. Edit your comment please.

Wow good eye
Keep in mind that people on Reddit people get down voted and called anti semetic just for saying this. I even got accused of funding Hamas lmfao. In real life, Israel literally chucked the diplomatic equivalent of a toddler's temper tantrum at the UN for saying this. These people a vile, disgusting, brainwashed, and deserve to be in prison.
It was never about hamas.
Dogs have such sensitive smells and ears, they know something horrible is happening but as it's constant and everywhere it must feel bewildering to them. They don't even bark like a regular dog would at the perceived threat.
1/3 comforting and 2/3 horrifying.
I'm all for Israel protecting itself, but there isn't any security justification for this. All the illegal West Bank settlements undermine Israel's claims, and should be removed.
The car was very threatening while struggling to make a 3 point turn in a war zone.They way it executed the turn was in fact terrorism.(/s obviously)
&gt;This is based on what? 8000 civilian casualties? How deep in ass a head needs to be to 1) trust that IDF is saying the truthHey! Guess where the "8000 civilian casualties" number comes from?Hamas. So how deep in ass a head needs to be to trust that Hamas is saying the truth?

Well we all know what happens when you point fingers
The bots are insane. I'm surprised on the platform war. I see a ton of pro-Israel bots on Reddit in particular that are going way over the top. Then it feels like Twitter is non-stop Pro-Palestine bots. I'll say this from my perspective. IDF and Hamas can go fuck themselves. I think the apartheid should end and civilians on either side shouldn't be targeted. I support the people of Israel, not the fucking IDF, and I support the people of Palestine, not fucking Hamas.
One side has air strikes, the other has rocks, but yeah both sides are equally suffering right?
Holy shit the cope is insane
Except Israel does more genocide
Israel has broken countless rules of engagement in the last three weeks you idiot. Google a list of medical facilities bombed by them in the last three weeks. Starving a population is a crime. Collective punishment is a crime. Look at Netenyahu's rhetoric and tell me this isn't a bloodthirsty revenge operation.
Netanyahu and the fascists need to them to be. Controlled opposition.
True, true!
They have posted this reply a bunch of times, literally copy pasted. They're either a bot or part of the astroturfing push. Or literally dumb enough to eat up idf propaganda I guess üòê
I am sure if any Palestinian was there trying to stop this from happening he would be arrested from trying to stop this government sanctioned theft. I do not know how they can justify this?
He's one of the people treating this shit as a sports match, don't waste your energy. These guys are so far gone they'll justify anything and argue in the face of overwhelming evidence. The bloodthirst is very real
They‚Äôre not after Hamas genius, they‚Äôre after killing civilians based on their ethnicity

New meaning to ‚Äòscorched earth‚Äô
They‚Äôve taking millions if not billions of funds meant for the people from across the world (including from USA) and invested it into what they‚Äôre doing today. The fact after three weeks of air strikes they‚Äôre still firing consistently shows how stocked they are. Also implies their access to food water and fuel they don‚Äôt allow civilians to have
Past Ukrainian attacks on crimea involved multiple different types of missiles and drones to saturate air defenses and improve the odds of getting a storm shadow gets through. Good chance that‚Äôs what this is.
After reading the commentary I had to change my opinion on this. I had been giving the IDF the benefit of the doubt (maybe they had already fired a warning shot, maybe there were ground soldiers nearby and it appeared to be a VBIED). But its pretty clear that this car took a wrong turn, realized that there was a tank on the other end and tried to get away. THEN, the tank fired. fucked
I doubt many in hamas are sitting happily. With Israel's reputation for infiltration and espionage, I bet very few of hamas leaders survive. The question is, will the bombing campaign and upcoming ground war spawn a new generation of hamas? Usually I'm a proponent of diplomacy but in this case, maybe it's time to send in the tanks and end this once and for all.
No Hamas in the west bank yet... Israel needs to sow a bit more terror and desperation for the new Hamas to emerge in the west bank.
They don‚Äôt care. They‚Äôll use the extremist as a justification to call them all nazis and try and cleanse them all.
Hamas is asking for a UN brokered humanitarian ceasefire because they are running out of rockets to fire at Israel.
Watching this man carry the body of his toddler son with a stone cold dead look on his face is an image that will be seared into my brain forever. I pray for his peace and that he continues to have this level of resolve to keep going. God bless this man.
How do you know?
Imagine basing your views on morality based on how many people die.Is the UK evil for killing hundreds of thousands of Germans during WW2?You're basically creating a negative incentive structure. Make as many of your civilians die as possible to get painted as the victim. People like you are the reason hamas happily launches rockets from population centers knowing the numbers will get cranked up.
Past Ukrainian attacks on Sovastapol have included multiple different types of missiles and drones to saturate/exhaust air defenses all working in tandem with storm shadow. These other type‚Äôs usually get intercepted at high rates, very good chance that‚Äôs what this is.
Plot twist: the other side are also semitic
They just won‚Äôt teach their kids about this in school, they‚Äôll ban The subject just like they did for the first Nakba
Not sure what RoE Israel is fighting under but after giving 2 weeks warning to flee North Gaza I think it's reasonable to engage vehicles on the roads in the north based on the likelihood they are concealed VBIEDs or Hamas transport. If Hamas wants less of that they can mark their military vehicles as they are required to do under international law and not use civilian vehicles.That being said I hope investigations do occur to see if that car was civilian and if so, whether or not the Israelis knew it before firing.
this is the ignorance I literally just mentioned which means Im sure you either didn't read or failed to understand my comment above. good luck in life with that mindset and ignorant attitude.
Hamas combatants would scout the frontlines covertly before driving a Honda civic down the road as if they were grabbing some Mc Donald‚Äôs. Not saying soldiers haven‚Äôt been caught off guard just more likely to be a civilians who is currently disconnected from the internet and telecommunications entirely than a Hamas soldier who has access to at least a degree of information regarding the frontlines.
Looks like it was actually thrown by that dude to the left.Can't really think of a any other reason a person would be bolting towards military vehicles like that.
So many animals. #free Israel
Being against Israel has nothing to do with antisemitism. That word is being used as a cudgel to justify atrocities.
"Why do I hear boss music?"
OK sorry we'll be better jews next time and just roll over without consequences when we get massacredAgain, very sorry
And unfortunately civilians on both sides have suffered (and will continue to suffer).
I see the IDF are doing their best to assist Hamas with their latest recruitment drive.
There is 100% hamas in the West Bank. If Israel pulled completely out of the West Bank like they did in Gaza hamas would throw out the PLO( by throw out I mean off of buildings like they did in Gaza). There have been rocket attacks coming out of West Bank but very minor.
and under hospitals
Israel doesn't cleanse. If it would, the casualties would be already tenfold
It means something like ‚Äúthe Geneva proposals‚Äù
Whatever, I'm pretty much done. If Israel wants to ethnic cleanse, then do it. I wish America were out of it. I'm just tired of being tied to their hip.
What about Argentina, China, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa and Turkiye and SA?  Are they just pretending too?
What‚Äôs the point of recording an assault if you‚Äôre just gonna say ‚ÄúI got that on video.‚Äù If someone puts their hand on you, knock them the fuck out and save that video for evidence. It‚Äôs called self defense.
What a brave man facing great tragdy made by zionists coward.
Not saying this didn‚Äôt happen, but there is an epidemic of disinformation going on right now.
Once every leap year
Same as everyone. Same rules. The Israelis even give a warning before bombing a house
There is one video on r/combatfootage of an infantry unit that received some mortar fire some 20m next to them or so.
So long as Palestine is under the control of Hamas I'm not rooting from them either. This isn't good guy vs bad guy. This is bad guy vs badder guy.
They‚Äôll draw red circles over the cupcakes to prove it
The mods actually ban anyone saying anything against Israel.
You guys are getting paid?
Nah, they probably voted for them.
They are used for UAV interception. I have seen them over my house. Not much room for JDAMs so they give them missiles
And there it is. The "they are all Hamas fighters" excuse. A normal residential car doing a 3-point turn with other civilians looking on is clearly Hamas!Warmongering tyrant. Keep justifying war crimes. Makes you look great.
Woah careful of dark link bro
If the Palestinians fought back, you know the local police would side with the Zionists and arrest the innocent party.
Why are there settlers in the West Bank? How did they get the house in the West Bank? Did they legally immigrate? Are they living by Palestinian laws? Have they done no killing? I wish to know these answers
Thats the one right answer
Yeah the ADM-160
I once met a lady on the playground who introduced herself by saying, ‚ÄúI got eight kids. Some of em are smart, and some of em are tough.‚ÄùThen I saw three of the latter somehow roll themselves down a slide and land on their heads. The last one jumped up, hit me with a stick, and ran away into the woods with his mom chasing after.
IMO the thing that breaks the symmetry is obvious: the large-scale terror attack by Hamas. Of course you can (and should) look further back in time and come up with an understanding other than "these people are evil and hate Israel for no reason so they deserve whatever they get." But that direct violent attack by a group that many people do not identify with is short-circuiting some empathy and understanding.To put it another way, when Putin was "only" inflicting a kind of low-level violence on Ukraine by seizing Crimea and backing separatist rebels in the East, the situation was largely overlooked. But then when he suddenly massively increased that level of violence, there was a big outcry. There is no universe where someone outside Russia can credibly believe that Ukraine violently attacked Russia, provoking Putin's Feb '22 full-scale invasion, so his massive escalation is just obviously heinous and unjustified.But here the attack by Hamas creates a kind of smokescreen. Whatever you think about how the policies of Israel and the Netanyahu government have harmed Gaza prior to this and what a reasonable response would be, no one can deny that there was a sudden escalation in violence by Hamas largely targeting people who have very little agency over Israel-Gaza relations. I think that makes it **way** easier for random people from far away to identify with "taking Israel's side" and not critically evaluate what the IDF says than it would be for the Putin case.
Yeah no doubt we are going to see more Israeli war crimes. Always be on the side of anti-colonial resistance. viva palestina!
Honestly I posted that maybe a day after it happened. It was probably just the universe communicating as usual haha
‚ÄúNo casualties? 20% was a minimum, not an estimate!‚Äù
Oh, so it's the numbers you have a problem with. If only there was a term for such denial...
Hamas fucked around, literally murdered infants and found out theyre getting bombed into oblivion. Am i supposed to be surprised?Fact hamas tells ppl not to evacuate so they can use them as human shields and propoganda as collateral damage is double damning.

History repeats.This is how Israel was born, go read about it. And the victims are the same btw.
They'll just put out a statement saying hamas baked 50 isreali babies into cupcakes and ate them.And people will believe it and support genocide.

Because it wont. This isn't the first time Israel has done this stuff and faced no consequences.

The star of david is the second religious or spiritual symbol being stolen by a group of supremacists in relatively recent history. Its weird that before it was the swastika between red bands and now is the star between blue bands. Before it was the "supreme aryan race" now its "the chosen people of god".
So is America, yet there such good people
Would you prefer them not fighting back while they get evicted from their homes, or have their homes destroyed, or even worse killed?
So they got around 300K US marines? Let alone the Palestinians kids, all Arabs are about to get smoked.
They told them that 2 weeks ago. Still this is a dumb idea because they have them what? 24 hours befora starting airstrikes? That is impossible to evacuate 2 million people somewhere when Egypt closed borders.   And how do we know these are civilians? Hamas doesnt have any armored cars/tanks so they could be using regular cars
Oh no! Hamas terrorists are terrorising the poor Israelis just driving by, whatever can we do to stop them!
literally nothing in that video indicates anything about the occupants other than there are in fact occupants.the speaker claims its a family in the longer version but even according to the longer version he has no way of knowing that we are aware of.also, driving around in a war zone is an inherently risky thing to do. In addition, theres no way the tank crew could identify friendly/foe and played it safe more likely. if theres evidence that they broke rules of engagement and/or knowingly fired on q civilian vehicle then thats different and will need to be tried after the war in a court of law--either domestic or international.the problem is your bad faith interpretation and the fact that you've already drawn a conclusion. the correct thing to do is weight every parties perspective and decision making and to form a hypothesis.its reasonable to assume the car was filled with hamas fighters as well as potentially just being civilians. its reasonable to assume the car was identified as a reasonable threat as well as to assume it was mistaken for a threat. its unreasonable to make the assumption the tank knowingly fired on civilians.you can't forget that 1. hamas blends into the population and uses human shield tactics, 2. hamas uses car bombs, and 3. Israelis have rules of engagement they almost never violate (what ever those rules are for the given mission).we might learn more with time, we might not
Daily reminder that in Russia, ‚Äúnazi‚Äù just means someone who is against Russia.  They were always chill with the ideology they just want it pointed away from them.
The rich want to keep their profits high so they take in cheap labor that has little knowledge of laws so they can abuse them further. Plus major waves of refugee immigration which has been a net loss for some countries. Our populations are declining but that is a fact in the whole industrial world and we simply need to reform the system to deal with less people which is also somewhat better for the climate.
Yeah you guys just send them to camps right ?
The irony "david vs goliath"...
I think it's his only pursuit. He puts in this air of middle class small town goody two shoes Christian who brags about how he has never had a drink or done drugs and sings in the choir, but  beneath all that he is extremely manipulative and  would throw it all away for money. Despite all his high minded talk, religion is nothing more than a means to an end.
If  a group of people grow up and are able to do horrible things with zero consequences it is totally unacceptable for normal people  to be able to tolerate  such feelings of entitlement.At one point in the film, the IDF didn't do something the settlers wanted to do and they instantly turned against the IDF calling the IDF soldiers 'Nazis'.Seems that country is being run by ultra-something - I don't even know what the word is, religious nuts - when most of Israel is secular people.
Of course, that's why I'm asking thenazi why he thinks this. Though he might just be an Israeli propaganda bot
What is the IDF strategy/mission? Do they have specific targets, go in, hit, leave? Do they go in and when hit, eliminate the hitter? Both of these? Do they clear the strip and leave when cleared? Clear and then guard/defend? Leave but increase buffer zone?
As someone who wants Palestinian liberation, but is also a zionist (an unfortunately loaded term) Jew, this really fuckin saddens me. Part of me at least hopes that the pro palestinian protesters had some sort of support for Hamas going, so I could understand this person, but given OP saying fuck Israel and Hamas, I think this israeli woman is just being a total shit head. This is not the way.
Yeah my eyes fucking roll at "probably" lmaoMaking sure to leave a little room of hope so that Israel can still look good!
They use the d9 to handle IEDs that are placed on the roads. You're commenting with such confidence.
Yep... well the ppl lobbing bombs live in an enclosed hell hole so what do you expect them to do? I'm not saying it's right, I am simply saying that's what you are going to get. I live in Canada and I am from European ancestry, it's not "my family".
also the first concentration camp with a growing population too
Palestinians are not Arab Muslims from Arabisation and Islamification.Palestinians are an Arab-Levantine hybrid group that share ancestors with us Jews. They've lived there just as long as our ancestors have. Arab Muslims did come and conquer and reproduce with Palestinians of their time, but those Palestinians have lived there for just as long as my Israelite ancestors did.We know that Egyptians and Mesopotamian groups had their own names for them too.

It‚Äôs like the entire world just completely forgot the lessons learned in Iraq and Afghanistan.
\&gt;Unlike Hamas, Israel doesn't intentionally target civilians.That is such bullshit. Besides the obvious and common killing of Palestinians, the entire Gaza strip is the target of a military blockade.
That is true, but it's also true that the 50-250k killed in the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine#Casualties) is nowhere near the ~10k killed in the [Israel-Hamas War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas_war#Casualties).
Anyone who lives in New York City knows just how horrible the street preaching black Israelites can be.
One war i never heard off
That seems to be the basis of a lot of their arguments: equating things that aren't equal.  Like how they equate Palestinians and Hamas. No, those babies they killed were NOT Hamas. Or how they say "any other country is allowed to defend themselves" but no other country is permitted to regularly kills innocent civilians like this.Saying there should be no Jews allowed if there are Palestinians around IS racist.  However telling someone they can't just go take someone's home isn't saying "no Jews allowed."  They're framing it that way, but it's not.  Not to mention, they, themselves, have "no Palestinians allowed" areas!  There's entire roads they're not allowed to drive on, huge chunks of cities they're not allowed into.  They're calling other people racist for doing things they do.
Great, now we got ghost-cope. There is no way we have a chance to get a win against them on the battlefield of non-credibility.What is next? Bullets dipped in cum? Poop bombs? Someone dropping Adam Sandler movies on their opponents to cause severe mental retardation?

Keep believing this human shield fallacy that israel has convinced you of. Literally no one outside of the US and Israel even brings that up because no one believes it.
let me guess, the reports are from hamas?

My boy Nomad heading to the sandbox
You seemed to stop listening then as well because his bottom line in the next few sentences is that the Israeli government actions and the IDF's failures led to the deaths of Israeli citizens.Sucks Israel told their citizens they were safe and moved soldiers to the West Bank to help with ethnic cleansing there, leaving those border citizens high and dry as a first line defense.  Makes you wonder why Israel didn't act on the intel the US and Egypt both told them about.  Then again, Bibi has been in some real political trouble and needed a good crisis to keep him in power...
How old are you? War is a human constant for thousands of years?
That's not the case. IDF stopped even roof bombing  to warn civilians (unless it's a hospital full of Al Jazeera reporters, they still have some respect to that).Also they do that. IDF has great counter battery abilities and they use it extensively which is one of the few legitimate things these psychos are doing right now.
Have you being paying attention to this sub on the last 10 hours or so? One of the biggest videos here is an innocent family getting fucking deleted from this world by a tank. Israel was justified in the beginning. They‚Äôre losing the moral high ground here.

Ah yes, the sounds I made up in my mind were pretty interesting.

That made my blood boil... fuck the Israeli government and fuck the 'settlers' all I see is a bunch of Nazis.
I believe ISIS was the group to pioneer drone dropped grenades sometimes around 2014-2015.
It's an article about a report prepared by the UN about possible violation of international law.Did you even read that?&gt;There are reasonable grounds to conclude that the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory is now unlawful under international law due to its permanence and the Israeli Government‚Äôs de-facto annexation policies, according to the first report to the General Assembly issued today by the United Nations Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and Israel.

Zionist are truly deplorable, ideology mixing with religion. They are not the same.
That anti semitism card is over used by now, I don't think people even care if someone call them anti semitic when they speak out on these disgusting behaviors.

West bank has no Hamas ruling so what's the reason for settlers stealing homes and killing?
I‚Äôm sure the prospect of getting free land played a huge role in his sudden desire to rediscover his heritage.
Exactly üëç
... Well I mean maybe the country dropping the bombs on civilians also takes a bit of the blame don't you think?
ah yeah, making stuff up, a classic argument.
What you reap is what you sow.
Well given how their ground forces are exterminating everything that moves, it‚Äôs actually not that far of a reach.
Yeah this ain‚Äôt facebook
you forgot oil
Israel has dropped thousands of JDAMs, I‚Äôd imagine a lot of Hamas are just small pieces of rotting meat now.
This is the Russian version of the Iron Dome, it's called the Iron Curtain. A lot slips through.
As an American, I'm familiar with the "if they had just followed directions..." excuse.
Yeah this is typically what happens when you bomb an Apartheid regime with a large military and no respect for human lifeIt's easy to judge Hamas because they simply are doing the wrong thing, but I wouldn't know where to even begin if I was being oppressed like Israel has been oppressing Palestine for the past decades.Really a shit situation caused by another holy war. We will never learn. For every person Israel murderes, they turn their family and friends into Muslim extremists with a hatred for Israel and a hatred for Jews. Another cycle of suffering with no-one to end it.One day we will all grow old and still people will be killed because of their religious beliefs.
Also, I don't support either side of the conflict; as most reasonable people. I think the Israel government and hamas are equally evil and should be held accountable for the deaths and harm to all citizens, and I believe the only support the US should provide is humanitarian aid in the form of direct resources, not financial packages nor weapons.
Firstly, we need immigration badly. Lol at your country and the demographic ahit show that is going to unfold over the next few decades for you. Have fun with that. Secondly, we're not all intolerant racist mofos with hateful attitudes towards entire swathes of the global society, as much as some would like to have you believe otherwise.
It's Israel.  They've been committing war crimes for 75 years.  The reason is ethnic cleansing and nothing more
&gt;These were civilians. Israel: Our intelligence services confirmed there were at least a dozen hamas operatives in the trunk of the vehicle!!
Gotta cheer for Spetsnaz nowWhat a crazy time to be alive
Americans have no say over where our tax money gets spent and the amount of money we send to Israel is shocking.  You‚Äôre 100% right, we should be up in arms at the support for these occupiers but alas we gotta keep working so uncle Sam won‚Äôt kick in our own doors to take our houses too.  Seems like a great system. look at these dorks, the entitlement and lack of shame especially by the men. Like, my guy youve got a couple foam mattresses and some old bags and you‚Äôre legging it into someone else‚Äôs house like you‚Äôre arriving at fyre festival.. pathetic really.   What happens when the owners come back for supper? You answer then door and claim some obscure ancestral right ?   All seems so odd.
This right here is what it's really all about folks.
/r/ worldnews is the Israeli circle-jerk HQ.
They shot down 8 Storm Shadow missiles staffed with British crews.
Fuck the zionists
committed by fascists
Love this, poor little buggers, they don‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs going on.
honestly, this whole video sounds like a logical fallacy. for instance she says talks about "farming the land" but never mentions *what* is there to be farmed, or she talks about how it "already belonged to them" but doesn't specify who "them" is besides "palestinians"i agree violence and killing is bad, but to stir the problem by spewing lies only makes it worse, and if anything, it will cause more violence
Well you see, the car was obviously being used as a human shield.  Tragic that the terrorists are making the brave IDF tanks do such things!
Ah, I missed that part and though this was more recent. I'm not saying any misinformation is acceptable, honestly; I wish we had laws to punish media and journalists who knowingly report false information.
You sound lost. The point I was making clearly went over your head. I‚Äôm not saying that Hamas isn‚Äôt utilizing civilian infrastructure in order to conduct guerrilla warfare. I‚Äôm saying that the concept of guerrilla warfare has nothing to do with whether civilians are being utilized in the process.We good? You got it now? This isn‚Äôt a difficult concept to grasp.
How does it prove Israel is not following international law, it's an article about the opinion of occupation.
Either denies, or outspoken fans of Hitler's work.
I bet you, none of the Stormshadows are still flying, so they were downed.
But they would be providing all the fuel hamas ever wanted! Not the IDF fault if Hamas accidentally lit the fresh supplies right?
# Israelis in 10-15 years when all the kids living through this resort to terrorism:![gif](giphy|6nWhy3ulBL7GSCvKw6)
Thanks, I could have Google‚Äôs it but i was just out of bed.
Yeah‚Ä¶ might want to redact that wish as more footage comes out‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre going full Russia.
&gt;  this has nothing to do with the warOk I mean you're right about it being an old video and also in the West Bank, but it *definitely* has something to do with the war.When a Palestinian living in Gaza considers the possibility of de-escalation with Israel, they can look at this video and see what that reality looks like.
It's also extremely frustrating because it's like alright so they leave and then what? They've left their home, possessions, schools, family, friends and means to sustain themselves. Even here in the U.S. that's a speed run to end up in prison so it's not like people can be excused for thinking there's somewhere safe to go.
So the part where the US encouraged jews to establish the state of israel. What book is this from?
WTF....oh we are playing kid games because we don't have a legitimate answer.    I know you are but what am I?
Abbas is the name that my autocorrect always puts in my text when I‚Äôm trying to write ‚ÄúAbbas‚ÄùEdit: *‚Äùand‚Äù
God does a really good job of not revealing himself
IDF told me the combatants live at your house and work
At the end she says it's OK to kill babies.WTAF is wrong with her?!? It's never ok to kill babies, ever! Absolutely disgusting and vile!
True, also the media is dominated by western companies so far less scrutiny is aimed at any allys war crime shenanigans.
That thing was moving. I know different cruise missiles approach or exceed  Mach, but it‚Äôs an entirely different thing seeing them in the air vs reading the capability on a sheet of paper.
My favorite is the Orthodox Jews that are protesting Israel and cursing out Zionist üíûüíûüíû
They have a name for that phenomenon, Vranyo
Casualties does not mean killed in the military. Casualties includes dead+injured
I know it‚Äôs true, oh so true, because I saw it on social media..
according to Israel there are 40,000 Hamas members and 2 million Gazans. Does that seem fair to you? to collectively kill a city the size of Manhattan, for the crimes of 0.02% of their population? you're sick
I pray for that day to come as soon as possible
That was yesterday! Today was 64! Shot them down with 8 rockets.... Trust me bro, I don't lie.
The death of innocent civilians in Gaza *is* a war crime, and that crime is being committed by Hamas not Israel. The use of human shields is in itself categorized as a specific intent war crime under the Geneva Convention and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
Let's not pretend Russia is doing that for humanitarian purposes. They're doing it because it opposes us interests in the region. This is a broken clock being right twice a day. Not principled support against genocide
I agree. I imagine the foundation of the majority of the buildings in Gaza are compromised by the extensive tunnels.
The occupation in the West Bank needs to stop.
There is, and there is PIJ, Lion's den and [others.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:Palestinian_militant_groups)
Are you kidding with me?? Do you think the IDF gives two shits about collateral damage? They are leveling entire complexes to hopefully kill one person. The gloves are off in this one.
This is hilarious. Apparently the other propaganda didn't work so now the talking point is that Europeans did the same thing hundreds of years ago, so that makes what Israel is doing to the Palestinians okay. Fuck out of here with your bullshit
So are you saying they aren't a terrorist group? Intresting ü§î
Because no one is going to challenge israel on these videos. Israel is never held accountable. They can post a grainy video of them bombing anything they want and say ‚ÄúHamas base‚Äù literally over 1,000 times as if Hamas is a military force of hundreds of thousands it will never be asked questions.No - this isn‚Äôt jumping to conclusions - this is about changing the narrative. Israel has shown zero regard for civilian life. Even if you wanted to pretend these videos they keep posting are truly Hamas targets (that never seem to run out somehow), ignore the HRW, Amnesty, UN, etc., reports that schools, bakeries, etc., are being bombed - even if you really wanted to adopt the cognitive dissonance that would allow you to make that leap because your inherent bias and/or brainwash lends itself to that - then answer for why Israel would cut off food and literally fucking water to 2.2 million people, half of which are children. When you‚Äôre capable of cutting food, water, and medicine off to kids - there‚Äôs no limit to savagery. Israel has one of the worst human rights records of the past 50 years by any reputable independent human rights group - including Israel‚Äôs own - B‚ÄôTeslem, which is the most prominent human rights group in Israel. It, along with Amnesty and HRW have all affirmed that Israel has targeted civilians and carries out an apartheid policy. Once evangelicals in the US die out, and AIPAC‚Äôs grip on US politics loosens, this facade of a narrative that Israel is not a terrorist state but a vibrant, liberal democracy trying to defend itself from neighbors that just hate Jews, is going to crash.
And they still have the nerve to play the victims üôÑ.
So officially, 8 stormshadow missiles hit their targets.
Tbf these guys weren‚Äôt ethnic Russians.
I read the US is donating two more Iron Domes to Israel which I found odd since isn't Israel the actual producer of Iron Domes?? Aren't they the ones exporting that system?

Yeah, but if you wave a Palestine flag it's okay.    /s
It would be genius to incite a mob, arrest them all, and send them to throw themselves at the Ukrainians. More mobiks (prisoniks?). Less internal rabble rousing. Ukrainian artillery positions revealed. Lets the Muslims think the Russians are permissive. Russia reassures the Jews that they aren‚Äôt yet on the chopping block.
Exactly. Those animals are going to kill as many palestinians as possible, so the way is clear for 'one state' Israel. Makes my blood boil..
Indeed, it was just a matter of time. Let us use the systems then poison them to push us into the directions they see fit. AI has much potential for good but the ability to manipulate the output should be concerning to all.

That we know of.
Don't worry, they are trying to stop the "from the river to the sea" nazis.
Daam sea of thieves new map looks dope
Given the limited additional footage, I think Hamas is much less technically capable of carrying out massive consumer drone strikes ala Ukraine's level of proficiency and accuracy.
Each ground troop trains at a similar length or a little more than an American marine.
This fucking sucks bad man.
I think the gunships and heavy armor were, uh, somehow unavailable.Bet the hostages were glad this didn't occur during peacetime.
Who decided that the buildings are where non-combatants live? Did someone on the Internet tell you or do you have special access to IDF intelligence?
‚ÄúHow dare the moslems incite a mob against the jews. That our job as Russians‚Äù
It seems like FOXNews is taking an ultra hard Israel support stance just because they know it will make infighting with people who are against war crimes.  The media coverage depending on the source is really playing on the emotions of people right now
Sure but that still doesn‚Äôt explain the bulldozer. You don‚Äôt bring that to fight combatants you bring that to demolish buildings where non combatants work and live.
The launching of munitions at the beginning not gonna be addressed?  That was a mini rocket.
Lots of rumor about it. Have we seen that actually being used?https://www.thedrive.com/the-war-zone/does-israel-really-have-sponge-bombs-for-sealing-tunnels
u/Steaknkidney45&gt; Unlike Hamas, Israel doesn't intentionally target civilians.How are they not targeting civilians again?
This is exactly what they are good at.
Have you seen the dailywire sub? It‚Äôs legit 4 comments and 300 deletes per post. You can‚Äôt have an opinion in that sub.
Well gaza people.. you guys let Hamas in power, Hamas want israel destruction.. you guys really pissed them off.. they at least warn you to go south.
According to hamas. Hamas aren't a reliable source of information though are they?
The delay in the round going off reminds me of the scene in pearl harbor when the japanese drop a bomb and it lands in the fighting pit and everyone runs but the one dude and yells out its  a dud then the fuse arms and poof.
such an interesting way of looking at it!
&gt; because that is basically the common rhetoricIt's basically a self fulfilling prophecy. What's hard to understand is how someone ISN'T radicalized when their family and friends are being killed like this.

This is the stuff you won't hear about in U.S. mass media.
This is why there is diminishing sympathy for Israel. They encourage this behavior.
They dont do anything to not hit civilians. They spend a ton of time discussing their few ‚Äúroof knocks‚Äù but every humanitarian org and the UN have stated that israel is bombing buildings without any warning. They then dropped gave really kind warnings to tell people to go south where it‚Äôs safe only to bomb the living shit out of the south. Khan yunis and rafah have had hundreds of deaths in the last couple of days.
And yet the global South was strangley silent on the Tigray war. The most destructive war of the century which is pretty much the exact same thing but in Ethiopia. That hypocrisy seems to be universal. You also have the inconvenient truth that a lot of western aid goes to gaza and is then used to fund hamas militant efforts.Let's face the fact that both sides here absolutely want to wipe each other out. Hamas still continues to fire rockets at Israel, they're just ineffective, while Israel is leveling entire blocks at a time. As a British citizen, we should get all the uk citizens out and walk away. That's it. No firther part in this. We don't supply Israel with weapons anyway (to any signifixant part at least), thats america, Germany and Italy.

But he was thoroughly exploring every crevice.
Because there is also violence spreading in West Bank as Muslims all over the world are hunting Jewish people and getting realised by Hamas.Latest incident was when a mob of Muslims stormed an airport in Russia yesterday looking for Jews.

This is kinda similar to a court case that I was on the jury for about 30 years ago.  An old woman had a fur coat on the front seat of her car.  She was taking it to the cleaners and had her car window open.  A guy walking by saw the coat, reached into her car, grabbed it, and took off with it.  An off duty court officer, who happened to be walking by at the same time, saw the guy grab the coat and run.  Basically the court officer and a mob of about 15 people who saw what happened ran after the guy and caught him.  We found him guilty.

They can't leave Gaza. They are stateless and all of the borders are closed to them. They're basically fish in a barrel.

Russian spetsnaz try not to deploy every heavy weapon including attack helicopters against hostage position challenge (apparently not impossible????)
Its nice when you get War Crimes on video.
Is anyone even shooting back at the Israeli's?  All the footage that's been released so far seems very one sided.  It doesn't look like any battles have actually taken place.
i would expekt the IDF to train heavely in urban combat because of just the type of enemy there fighting.
As are reprisal killings of Palestinians by settlers, [to whom the Israeli government has been distributing guns](https://www.timesofisrael.com/distribution-of-300-assault-rifles-to-west-bank-civilian-security-squads-underway/).

close to [500,000 people have died](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_War), not wounded, but killed since the Russian invasion (Mostly soldiers). This statement is just emotional conjecture.
It disgusts me whenever I go into any of those comment sections. The utter lack of humanity is depressing as hell.

It‚Äôs gonna do a hell of a lot more than a rock. Still could easily disable the vehicle. I would imagine there is an intake some where that sucks air in that would be a major weak point. You are not looking for any explosion just to disable the vehicle.
As much as I'd like that to be true, Germany is just not comparable with Israel and Palestine. In Germany there aren't two completely different people with different religions fighting for space, Germany had a long history of solid national identity, had strong government and social structures etc. unlike Gaza and so on.Also it's a lot easier to say Germany were the bad guys, Palestinians will not condemn Hamas that easily.
Wait Hamas was targeting those unguided rockets at military targets right? They‚Äôre not terrorists, they‚Äôre just a resistance movement trying to fight the IDF off. Oh wait.
Because then a single spark would set it all off and the world would be crying about them not giving Gaza any fuel.
Yip, usually involving sex crimes.   And Israel accepts them back with open arms.   There's a thread on reddit about it with a map showing registered sex offenders living in Israel.

Chosen is supposed to mean a high moral duty. Not a duty to be immoral. But Jews are as human as anyone else. People want to steal and they want to take what doesn‚Äôt belong to them, and if religion tells them it‚Äôs ok, they‚Äôll listen.
Ethnic cleansing and genocide obviously
You're so brave!
While there won't be 100% eradication of terrorist groups like HAMAS (since there would always be radical islamists left), reducing their operational capability would work just fine, ground invasions did that to al-Qaeda and ISIL.
At least then the territory would be used for good
In civilian cars they're currently targeting.

That‚Äôs the point. We‚Äôre getting into an era where the state does whatever it wants (monopoly of violence) and we have to look on because we have no means to defend ourselves. The military industrial complex is owned by the rich. The tech-media complex is owned by the rich. They control the messaging or at least TRY to. Honestly, I think top US officials are trying to get Israel to chill because the US is in danger of spreading itself too thin. I think the US pulling out of Afghanistan was so that the US could quickly pivot to Ukraine if they needed to because they knew resistance was inevitable to boil over. That‚Äôs the strategy of the west, be a huge dick to everyone but don‚Äôt invade until resistance fighters attack. Then you can twist the narrative to ‚ÄúSee!! We and our allies are defending ourselves!‚Äù. Classic military strategy. And it‚Äôs exactly what Israel is doing. WW3 hasn‚Äôt started yet. The worst is still yet to come. We‚Äôre in the midst of a propaganda war (hybrid war) between the East and West as two spheres of influence, and the US being the richest is trying to finance Western powers in various proxy wars (Ukraine and Israel). I‚Äôm mostly worried this conflict could evolve into a religious war. I get the feeling Israel on behalf of the west is trying to goad the Muslim world into a Jihad against the west/Christianity/Jews. ‚ÄúSee! We‚Äôre just defending against Islamic fundamentalist terrorists‚Äù. Well guess what, Israel funded Hamas. The US funded ISIS. The US/CIA has been involved in the support of countless right wing uprisings across the world. It‚Äôs always been written on the wall.
Exactly why I think religion is ridiculous, just a way of controlling the masses
yes, like all good ground attack weapons that arc to angle down as close as possible right before the strike.  You cant really see shit but these would of  been tree top level visible unless or on their attack angle which is unlikely as one missile continue horizontal.

Those poor people.There is no strength greater than God, but God apparently didn‚Äôt give a shit. The whole scenario makes me so angry.
Holy shit you are right that man limped

Isreal has lost the support of the world. Hopefully, our tax dollars will be next.
Maybe. Most of the clips I see on this sub, the buildings that look like this collapse like sand castles.
And the real religious Jews protesting Israeli government's actions are getting the shit kicked out of them by the IDF and the cops.
Yes, it was funny they thought they could get away with that in Ireland. I'm sure it's why it got leaked, especially after they fired a woman for showing support to Palestine.
It would definitely be untrue.
And how many were intentionally shot?
I know you were being sarcastic, but it‚Äôs actually their exact justification.https://preview.redd.it/3dv8901kadxb1.jpeg?width=1178&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=74d923d97bd939d16c69e9c6dda85b808e9ccbfc
Reinforced concrete can take some beating, common thing.
More like: "More guys firing full-auto into the air? Meh. Yesterday at my cousin's wedding, to celebrate, we brought in a technical with an AA gun that cooked off 5 whole belts of 12.7mm."Inured to weapons of mass slaughter &amp; random violence is pretty much the human condition in Central Asia.
Ah Jeez, Ireland is not the place for that nonsense. They're one of the most pro Palestine countries around. Something about parallels to the troubles / English colonialism.
She‚Äôs used to being able to attack Palestinians without consequences from her government. Sick, sick people.
Why did someone punch her ?

Ah yes. The ‚Äúeverything is super simplistic and the issues in Gaza are the same as the issues in West Bank‚Äù mentality.
&gt; How do people get into any country illegally?By flying in or crossing borders. Hard to do when its blockaded. Egypt is building a wall on its border with Gaza, they'll get flagged by Israeli security services if they try to go through Israel, and there's no flying or sailing in past the Israeli air and naval blockade.&gt;Sure. And will motivate more fighters to come fight them or just create more fighters from the civilian population.Maybe. On the other hand ISIS was handily destroyed.
Genuinely. I try to keep my hands to myself but if a crazed person approaches me like that and attempts to assault people. I would‚Äôve chuffed the shit out of her. As a gentle reminder not to put her hands on people.
One Molotov cocktail not really a "sophisticated" weapon could stop this bulldozer.
&gt;be betterIt's maddening that there seem to be so few people interested in this. There's so much hate and so little willingness to try anything different.Trying to be better shouldn't be controversial. Violence begets violence begets violence. This current tragedy of a situation is a direct result of the absolute failure of the world to address this situation going back *decades.*But it's all been reduced to the usual team sport by propaganda from every side. Nuanced discussions about how a situation so awful was created that various factions on either side think it's morally justified to murder innocent families get drowned out by the loudest, most extreme voices. Critical thinking and attempting to see past your own biases is largely dead in public discourse.

Is it more reasonable to assume Israel just bombs civilians for fun, right after doing everything possible to not hit civilians?
There‚Äôs a department in the Israeli government that advertises to any one with Jewish heritage that they can come and get a home and land in the homeland. So the Israel government puts these people up in hotels or other accommodations until they can put them in a Palestinian home at which point it becomes their home, and the Palestinians are forced out at gunpoint

Terrorist trash. Next.
Ah the second holocaust in its infancy. Great. /s
Which side is this comment trying to support? I read it as Israel has killed 8000 civilians trying to fight Hamas?
Always been like them
Don't worry, they got their asses chewed out by command after the operation. "You wrecked zero fucking cars!!!"
No, no Hamas fandom things* please* I refuse to put "Hamas" and "waifu" in same sentence. "Fandom things" was already pushing it.
Report is 8 StormShadow/SCALP, 2 Neptune, and three rece drones. What we see here colud be the drones. They also report the SS were launched by one Su-24 and three Su-27, which is a novelty, since previously only Su-24 carried SS. Neptunes were launched from Odessa area.
Technically, they already do.Just not on Ukraine's side.russian ["Forpost" is nothing but a licensed copy of IAI Searcher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IAI_Searcher#Forpost-R), Lancet looks suspiciously like [HERO-400...](https://uvisionuav.com/loitering-munitions/hero-400/)
Spetznaz assault against civilians watching a play in Moscow: 100 collateral damage.Spetznaz assault against people trying to organize a pogrom: no deaths.So all you need to do to survive when the Spetznaz launch their assault is be a massive racist.
Are you a military intelligence officer? If not you should consider becoming one. You seem to have a innate ability to synthesize publicly available information and draw conclusions from it. You are making a lot of baseless assumptions without providing a sliver of evidence to back it up. How do you know Hamas has X number of buildings? Are you able to look through the fog of war and figure out the true number of civilian causalities? Let me throw your own question back at you. What reasonable person could think that Israel would voluntarily post videos of them intentionally striking civilians? You learn from the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital explosion and recognize how dangerous it is to jump to conclusions without any evidence.
Yes, this is what Russia wanted all along.  Someone else committing war crimes to dilute the horror of their own.
What have I been fucking telling people! exactly what you're seeing on video......Hamas and Israel are the same fucking beast, this should not be a controversial statement it should be a fucking statement of fact. They are the same hydra trying to bite each other's head off.The Israeli government and the IDF are terrorists no different than Hamas, their tactics are different but the outcome is the same.Are we just supposed to ignore the fact that Israel has killed about 10 times more Palestinians in the past 10 years than any Palestinian terror group had ever even come close to killing?1400 Israeli civilians in one day and now we are surpassing 8,000 Palestinian civilian deaths in just the last 3 weeks in airstrikes alone. Israel has killed more than 20,000 Palestinians in the last 75 years since the Nakba. But make no mistake Israel is continuing their Nakba.
poorly trained. maybe forgot that you can use tank and heli strikes on building with hostages.
an exploding AA missile could also be one that lost lock and gets self destructed. not every puff of smoke is a guaranteed intercept.
The Israel gov. doesn't turn a blind eye. They actively promote it. You can apply for a settlement and the IDF will clear it out for you.
If y‚Äôall gone be out here protesting, please have the means to protect yourself from private citizens. Don‚Äôt just let folks assault you. (That‚Äôs the police‚Äôs job üíÄ)

Holy shit what a bunch of sadistic ghouls.
they can be programmed to do a popup just before they hit to get better downward penetration but if your intercepting at that stage you are firing AA rockets onto the thing your trying to protect.
No you are correct. It's passed matrilineally.
When russia denies it's a confirmation.
https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/us/politics/ukraine-russia-war-casualties.htmlhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casualties_of_the_Russo-Ukrainian_WarI need to correct this, because there *is* a point to be made there, but you got something wrong. Netanyahu killed more Palestinians than Putin killed Ukrainians in *eight* years of the Donbass war, prior to the escalation in the winter of 2022. Since that escalation an order of magnitude more people have died, which makes you wildly incorrect.
TBH, I wouldn't trust a mob not to hurt people entirely uninvolved with their current hate boner.
Idk how you could sleep at night knowing you stole the room you‚Äôre in from someone else. The way they‚Äôre all running, it‚Äôs almost like they‚Äôre treating it like some big giveaway. This is one of the main reasons I‚Äôm not pro either side. Both sides are terrible‚Ä¶
Look at that person's comment history.  They just call everything that makes Israel look bad misinformation, even if it's not.   Your headline was correct, this was on the outskirts of Gaza. By definition "outskirts" is the outer part of a city or town.  The fact that you used that word meant you could only have been talking about the city.He's the one spreading misinformation.
It was a haven of relative tolerance for Jews in a land filled with people that hated them. Poland was/is pretty bad.
I don't really have any strong opinions in general since I am not very knowledgeable on the conflict. I am sure Isreal has done and is doing heinous things.That said, it does make a big difference if the occupants of the car were civilians or if they were hamas militants. It goes from war crime to being acceptable. Just because they were fleeing from a tank while in a car does not prove that they were not militants.
long list
Everyone in Dagestan is descended from about 8 people
The "denazifiers" everybody.
I think greed is the motive, religion is the tool
Well, since that VHS tape had previously been run through a demagnetizer, that is all snippets of video the scientists were able to retrieve from it...
Why is this fake information. If you claim it could have been a rocket from hamas its kinda wierd isreal are saying it was done with a few grenades no?
‚ÄúChuck! Start the engines!!‚Äù
But Israel does follow international law... So..?
It‚Äôs also funny that people returning land to Native Americans would be a MUCH more recent correction of ownership. in 1948, there hadn‚Äôt been a Jewish state in that region since almost literally Jesus‚Äô time. 400 years max for native Americans vs. almost 1900 for Jews in Israel.
haven't you heard the intercepted conversation from that car? they were explaining to each other in every detail their plan, because terrorists can't help thmeselves but doing exposition dumps every time they talk to each other
You might want to read some history, because people stealing land and homes from indigenous people is pretty common and not usually based in a religion. It's mostly about economics and racism. People don't need religion to be horrible, they just need permission from the collective.
Just to be clear, a lot of Americans are not fine and dandy with the aid that the US sends to Israel. Just like a lot of Israelis are not fine and dandy with their genocidal government.
ya idk what people are seeing lol.
Well, they could leave the land they is not theirs, so they won‚Äôt be stoned

Basically. Imagine if they had no Latinos to blame. Then what?
HAMAS said there were IDF operatives in that apartment building so it‚Äôs not terrorism /s
None. Ever.
Notably, what the IDF posts in English and what they post in Hebrew have wildly different tones. This is done so deliberately. It's also why the IDF posted their "warning to Gaza" in English and on Twitter...when at the time, only 11ish % of Gazans speak English and 0% of them had internet access.
Thank you for the clarification. I could not attribute the watermark.
Since reddit is really stupid, this has nothing to do with the war, the date is at the bottom of the post. Also there haven't been settlements in Gaza since Israel evacuated like 20 years agoThe settlement activity is up by the West Bank
Not the only logical conclusion. He could also be a god that's intentionally an asshole, or just incompetent. Possibly a god with brain damage.
&gt; How exactly will they flood into Gaza?How do people get into any country illegally? &gt; How will Russian aid get in?They will always find a way. Also, I'm more talking intel. &gt; In any event, Israel is easily capable of handling Hamas on its ownSure. And will motivate more fighters to come fight them or just create more fighters from the civilian population.
And you would be right, that's one of the reasons Israel doesn't bomb civilians.
They already recreate WWZ if you count that they are give in with their arsenal to the point that WW2 weapons are seen pretty often.
This reminds me of interviews with tank commanders from the 2014 Gaza War who claimed they were ordered to fire indiscriminately into residential buildings.This isn‚Äôt an accident.  It‚Äôs policy.
and still one got through and hit an apartment. The people of Israel have to live near bomb shelters. Just not acceptable to me. US would've killed all the terrorists long ago, instead of building bomb shelters.
&gt;What really amazes me is just how little of an effect it had on the crowd.Probably either a sign of just how determined the people are that tried to kill those Jews, or that they are used to it. Both are rather disturbing thoughts lol. Tbh anywhere outside of areas like Europe, US or Asia around Japan/Korea/China the living conditions are a nightmare. Just looking at how people live their day-to-day life in places like India and Pakistan disturbs me often.
Is that why they‚Äôve kept warning people to leave over and over again?
That is a large rally. I am having a hard time understanding the anti-Israeli sentiment when it comes to the civilian hostages. Obviously they need to return before peace is possible?
Israel and the US have the same rules of engagement.How many bombs did Israel drop? I doubt Israel out bomb US. I mean have you seen the size of the Israel army?
Ethnic cleansing broadcast in real time, how horrific #noholywars
It‚Äôs more insane how these people are putting themselves on the frontlines of things too. Like the last place I want to live at is where the last owner wants me dead for obvious reasons.
Fucking Nazis
Joke is on Israel. For every Hamas you kill, our Legion of Ghosts only grows stronger.
No, what she did is pretend that there were no Je ws influencing colonialism, which is a complete load. She is a psyop. You people are redacted.
They Americans gave ‚Äúmald‚Äù whatever they‚Äôre called (they mimic other missiles, they‚Äôre decoys . they launch them before or with the strike and with ‚Äúharms‚Äù so maybe they‚Äôre meant to be hit you know what I mean
That‚Äôs a weird way to spell terrorist.
Hamas was using that turning around car as a shield!!! They had a tunnel underground to that EXACT SPOT /sIsreal really doing their best to become the villain here
Yeah, breaking the Geneva convention is the BARE MINIMUM and they still can't do that right.
In case you needed more evidence that Israel is a terrorist state...
[An Israeli company Wix tried to tell their employees in Dublin to show support for Israel's "narrative" on social media and use their talking points. They encouraged them to project Israel as a "European Western" country with how white they are like Europeans because it makes Americans and Europeans relate to them, unlike Gazans who are brown and non Western. To continue to share stories and talking points about the Hamas attacks as Israel bombed Gaza because it was creating "difficult pictures" of brutalised dead Gazans, so by continuing to share these stories about the attack 3 weeks ago "it creates a feeling that it is happening at the same time" as the bombings aka it creates a justification in people's minds about why it had to keep going. They also sought to create a database of companies who had come out against Israel.](https://www.irishtimes.com/ireland/2023/10/24/internal-wix-chat-encouraged-staff-to-support-israels-narrative-in-hamas-conflict/)And this is just one Israeli company. The entire country operates like that. I've come across multiple literal IDF soldiers on this and other subs trying to advocate as objective people in support of Israel.
Well they ban anyone there that doesn't post to support their narrative. It's free speech suppression to manipulate propaganda.
&gt; It was disgusting, and it's dumbfounding seeing the same "NAFO" profiles on Twitter who called it a war crime before, calling this a "Good Job" or "Well it's their fault being on the road".dude if the rational logic of the the "good humans" wasn't with the hypocrisy you described, we probably wouldn't even have wars at all in this modern age. Just thinking about youtubes/artists who get cancelled over the dumbest shit and then remembering that BBC or CNN or whatever reporter who said "These are western people with blond hair and blue eyes who looked exactly like us, not some refugee from the middle east" about Ukranian seeking refuge, should be enough to stop hoping for any rational equal morality. &amp;nbsp;war exists because everyone take sides.
Yeah, I get the warning shots; it's the biggest show of force they can make short of actually firing on the crowd and turning the whole thing into a bloodbath. What really amazes me is just how *little* of an effect it had on the crowd. If this happened where I live, everyone would've *bolted* the moment they heard a single gunshot - nevermind continuous full-auto bursts - but these guys were practically chilling. I wonder if that was because the soldiers didn't shoot anyone after the 1st, 2nd, 5th, *n*th warning shots, so they reached the collective conclusion that "Hey, these guys aren't *really* going to shoot us, we're not in any real danger."
Israeli settlers like:![gif](giphy|5wWf7GMbT1ZUGTDdTqM|downsized)
ok... Jains then
Hamas are all under ground during the day so who ever is outside are  Palestinian civilians
Correct. It's also the origin of the phrase "beyond the pale", though the Ngram Viewer data suggests a closer correlation with the Russian Pale of Civilization than with the English Pale.
&gt; I thought storm shadow hugged ground to avoid being detected until last moments.They do, they bunt just before target to get a good look at it and find the kill point - they're also pre-programmed to fly nowhere near air defences. Russia can't shoot down Storm Shadow/SCALP outside it _may_ have got lucky once or twice (even that is questionable tbh, given how short a time it's in your arc of fire).

This doesn't appear to have been picked up by the western media.Here's what LiveMint (who previously worked with the Wall Street Journal) say he said:&gt; Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Sunday invoked the theory of ‚ÄòAmalek‚Äô, a nation in the Hebrew Bible, to justify the killing of Gaza residents in the ongoing Israel-Hamas war that has killed over 1,400 Israelis, and nearly 8,000 people in Gaza.Amalek is referenced in 1 Samuel 15:3 New International Version&gt; Now go, attack the Amalekites and totally destroy all that belongs to them. Do not spare them; put to death men and women, children and infants, cattle and sheep, camels and donkeys.‚Äô‚Äù

It‚Äôs heartbreaking when those whose actions have nothing to do with the mess we are constantly in, have to pay the harshest price. Whether it‚Äôs the kids or the animals.
&gt; a modern liberal democracy like IsraelThe fact people still say this about Israel even without considering the recent developments in ethno-fascist cleansing says a lot about the power of propaganda.Earlier this year the government literally [passed a law to strip power from the Supreme Court](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/07/24/middleeast/israel-supreme-court-power-stripped-intl/index.html).
When I used to see them at marches before social media I would have people tell me they "weren't real Jews". It baffled me because as a kid I would think, these men are pretending to dress up like Jewish people to protest against Israel without being Jewish? That seemed a little excessive and weird.
Per the IDF, Hamas had actually moved their headquarters to the fuel tank of that station wagon seconds before the heroic tank took them out.
Wait until the IDF releases proof supporting this. It's a picture of a car with a red rectangle delimiting where Hamas base is located.
We live in a time where the Russian govt &amp; its sympathizers are actively calling out the Israeli govt &amp; it‚Äôs sympathizers for being Nazi‚Äôs, while being Nazi-esq themselves. Where the US government &amp; UN general body disagree on the handling of a very similar to ‚ÄúOIF‚Äù like scenario. The brits, who created the mess, have slinked themselves into some crevice &amp; the world is none the wiser.What a time.

That's not true, they post a lot of Palestinian stuff. But I do think there is a weird mod there. I posted a video of a Zionist attacking a man for wearing a kuffiyeh and it was getting upvotes and comments and suddenly the post got deleted and no longer showed up on the sub.
Try to defend these blood thirsty barbarians again, just try.
What is living space, if not free homes on free land to run into after the families have left in fear of death?
&gt;Do they not realise this is literally just creating more extremists if anything?  That's half the point. It's way easier to try and justify stealing land when you steal it from extremists. Israel will probably take over half of Gaza now and say 'Hamas made us do it'

"I would have gotten away with it too, if it wasn't for those meddling Jews"
Quick question (and I apologize if this is offensive as it is not meant to be at all), I know that all of those who identify as Jewish are not Israeli, but do all Israelis identify as Jewish?  Are there any Israeli-born people who identify as anything but their than that?

Just use your device native translator. On the box for the date change the second one to a particular date to see troops lost on that day.Like they lost one yesterday. Which suggests the tank that was destroyed resulted in one dead with one capture that was the one the Hamas video. Not sure if any other IDFs were injured. The site only lists fallen soldiers.
Preferably a plane without any minorities on board.
What I meant it in the rural areas of Gaza city, but you are correct
Genocide apologist.
the worldnews subreddit is a cesspool of this rhetoric
No one seems to care.
It's on the outskirts of the city of Gaza.  Your own map shows that.  By definition "outskirts" refers to the outer area of a city or town.  He could only have been talking about the city of Gaza.Is that your go-to?  Just call everything misinformation?  Even things that don't matter?  Why would anyone spread misinformation about the location of this?  They wouldn't.  You just call it "misinformation" to add to the "everyone is against Israel and spreading lies" narrative.The irony is that calling this misinformation means *you're* the one trying to spread misinformation.
Whenever people justify killing stone throwers, I think about this quote from Terry Pratchett: ‚ÄúHe asked you to shoot at people who weren‚Äôt shooting back,‚Äù growled Vimes, striding forward, ‚ÄúThat makes him insane, wouldn‚Äôt you say?‚Äù‚ÄúThey are throwing stones, Sarge,‚Äù said Colon.‚ÄúSo?

Is okay. Amazon have good return policy.
Isn't "activist" just media code for "criminal that we like"?Edit: Downvoted but no idea why :-D
I assume it's the origin of the word *palisade* as well.
And?It's still near Gaza tho, and they are targeting civilians.
We should stick to the post-911 tradition of invading the country "responsible" for an atrocity. So Madagascar is the obvious target.
What reasonable person could think that thousands of bombs are all really Hamas targets? Hamas doesn‚Äôt even have thousands of buildings in Gaza. Anything that Hamas has, israel already knew about and bombed early on. What else is left for there to bomb? Israel is saying it is targeting hundreds of targets per day. At some point you have to triangulate the fact that Hamas is all things considered not that big of an entity and the sheer civilian death toll and logically conclude these aren‚Äôt military targets.
Tbh the entire situation doesn't scream special forces. Soldiers in a large crowd completely on their own with some people they need to protect while everybody around them goes crazy. Considering 1 or 2 of the guys is a bit more trigger happy mixed with the overall confusion and stress makes it impressive they didn't just open fire on everybody around them.
This is why the USA held Israel back. They‚Äôve been waiting to do this.
A lot of people know literally NOTHING about the conflict/dispute/war. They don't know because: 1; they don't care, 2; they were never told about it or have never come across it, or 3; the media refuses to report on it because it's "not interesting enough" to most people.

this is possibly, the dumbest take i have ever seen in my entire time on the internet
YNC and Kaotic videos get them posted there. Mostly pulled off telegram links but I don't know any of those. Nor do I want my phone linked to a Hamas ran account.Gaza is getting their internet access back on during the day. So people are able to upload things then. And the drone threat isn't much of a problem because during the day they are taking a defensive position while prepping for the next overnight push. When they start to advance is when they cut off communications.And yes cutting off a populations communications could be considered a war crime. But we are in the age of drone and electronic warfare. So a gray line has developed that allows them to shut out Gaza completely while they push into the city.
Oh my bad, didn't know you were privy to the military intelligence and CAS requests of the IDF. Since you are quite omniscient, can you tell me the lottery numbers for this week?your comment has to be one of the most poorly thought out comments made on this sub in the past several years. the sheer volume a space in your head is only dwarfed by the amount of ego in your heart.how could you possible know these are or are not military targets? occam's razor and evidence in the video clearly leans towards providing fire support and striking military targets. any other observation is either clearly a stretch or downright bad faith. there is the potential that you're a child and have never really seen war footage before, but this is absolutely normal CAS behavior.

If Russian soldiers did rescue Jewish people from that mob, then they deserve kudos.
My man!! You are my kind of Jew!
If I remember correctly, Iron Dome aims to intercept in a manner that directs debris towards unpopulated areas. However, there are instances where debris falls in populated areas, which is why the instruction is to remain in shelters for 10 minutes post-siren. While I don't recall any injuries caused by debris, there have been instances of property damage.
No, it means they are good Jews.  I'm in that group.
Interesting that this vid is making the rounds and yet it's not posted there at all. Currently*
Who are their enemies? Because this is the west bank buddy, no hamas.

Regardless of any additional evidence, we just witnessed a fucking sedan making a careful 3-point turn AWAY FROM THE TANK get obliterated by a tank round. You are desensitized if that is not appalling - get some fucking therapy.
More completely indiscriminate Hamas fire on Israeli civilians.
No large media outlet or government calls out state terror unless it is done by brown or black people (e.g. hamas rn and nelson mandela during apartheid)
I'm Jewish and i've been saying for years that Israel acts like a cunt.  They don't represent Jews, and they hide behind the star of david on the flag.
How is any of this easily identified as a military target? All you see is normal looking buildings being blown up. Just the sheer magnitude of bombs dropped over the last 3 weeks make it obvious . Like there‚Äôs no way there are still Hamas targets to bomb - it‚Äôs not like israel is saving them for later.
I don't think I would want my invasion to be compared to Iraq. That's just me.

In this sub, that is a fool‚Äôs errand. I have no idea how this sub found me years ago, but I respect the mods and news delivered here. Prior to the current catastrophe, Palestinian rights and the violence the experienced was shared here regularly.

Don't call it Grad School for nothing.
Thanks!    I don't know what's more absurd; how the spetnaz operators are just magdumping into the sky like they're at an arab wedding party, or how the crowd seems to give zero fucks about it. Straight-up wild west shit.

They‚Äôre not mad or stupid. They‚Äôre evil terrorists.  Sorry, a lot of them are stupid, but the rockets are very intentional.
Cheeky fuckers. Well done to them innovating.
Or RPO-A . Nothing spices up the first day at school more than a thermobaric flamethrower.

Exactly! Everyone knows if you throw a rock in someone‚Äôs general direction they have the right to slaughter your children and any journalists in the area.It‚Äôs based on that famous Bible story where someone is throwing rocks at Jesus and he goes on an epic civilian killing spree.
More room for you on the other side of that joke ;)There were double negations going on there that probably confused you. Sure did confuse me hahah.
They had to be compared to a animalistic mob of anti-semites, but it's *something*.
Where are you seeing these videos? I don‚Äôt want to support Hamas channels or accounts, but IDF is posting basically nothing (other than this, which is surprising that they allowed their sniper to be seen)Even though Gaza is w/o internet, are snap/videos/etc still flowing through?
The rest took a t-72 round to the face.
MALD! They got a few of them I believe.
There hasn't been a Jew or Israeli in Gaza since 2005 (until now)
Bless this man.
None of us is as dumb as all of us.
Someone here should spread news again that a plane carrying Jews is going to land again. So these people will storm their airport again, do it for the lulz pls.
They could barley hit a drone.

To be fair, rocks can cause serious, sometimes lethal damage, even through a helmet. The IDF really has no choice but to kill the closest journalist.
Grad is what the children crave.
Fuck Israel
if this isnt sarcasm then wow
I wish I could upvote this more than once.

Video is mislabeled. For one: that's the Saladin road, about halfway into Gaza, nowhere near the border.Here's a sample geolocationhttps://twitter.com/JulianRoepcke/status/1718924497435205869Be more careful about misinformation

If anyone would like to witness what it's like in Gaza right now, [here is one photographer who keeps posting ig stories from the ground.](https://www.instagram.com/motaz_azaiza/)
The funniest thing is that there were no Israeli citizens on that plane
thats what they want, governments turn a blind eye to their war crimes this means israel can then bomb palestinians even more which creates more exremists which then leads to more war crimes and then the whole cycle repeats

It seems painfully obvious that there cannot be any peace until Hamas has been eliminated. How is Israel agreeing to a ceasefire going to guarantee that these rockets will stop?
Well, they had to or Israeli loitering drones will be flying on Ukrainian skies if they failed.
Gaza is not defended as well as certain parts of Ukraine. If you use the same strategy in this way against Germany, Poland, or Switzerland it wouldn't work out. Kinda apples to oranges man
This is not the reason, and IDF are counterfiring with artillery, mortars and drone-fired missiles. First, don't need a JDAM to take out a rocket team/rockets.  Also, mortars, artillery, and drone fired missiles are the only thing that can respond in any reasonable amount of time, and even then, it's usually not fast enough to stop all the rockets, since they can be set up so quickly. TL;DR: basically direct fire is the only thing fast enough to stop rockets before any of them get off the ground.
You have any evidence to back up your claim or is your source ‚ÄúI made it the fuck up‚Äù?
Yup. Israel has given ceasefire after ceasefire just for Hamas to break it. Oct 7 was the final straw. At this point Israel doesn't care what the world thinks. It knows it has the military power to take on any foe in the Middle East. So it's going to do what it wants. It's up to us to decide whether we want to be with them.
&gt;The word pale, meaning a fence, is derived from the Latin word pƒÅlus, meaning "stake", specifically a stake used to support a fence.\[2\] A paling fence is made of pales ganged side by side, and the word palisade is derived from the same root. From this came the figurative meaning of "boundary"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The\_Pale
Homans and greed\* religion did some war but mostly greed.
What if you believed that doing it would bring the Messiah back quicker?  Religion can make people do things they would otherwise find completely immoral.
Well they‚Äôve been blowing up retreating civilian vehicles with tanks. Not sure that‚Äôs the ass kicking you were hoping for though. Then again, based on this sub‚Äôs rhetoric it probably was what you were hoping for.
Yeah exactly way way too high
A mod posted in the comments yesterday that they are bombarded and overwhelmed and the only reason that things are loosening up on the pro-Israel side is because they upped thresholds on account age when posting comments.    It's very much a bot filled information war going on right now.  Whenever someones very unreasonable in discussion you should assume it's a bot, reasonable people like to comment reasonably over stuff like this.  Bots aren't capable of that nuance they are triggered off key words and only can post the divisive rhetoric they're programmed to post.

They‚Äôre too bloodthirsty for some abstract concept of revenge to care.
Why do you think they are cutting all network communications overnight as Israel pushes in harder? It's not just a block media signals. But drone signals as well.The US Air Force has had an R-135v Rivet doing laps off the Gaza coast every night. Probably how they're providing such efficient jamming. Specializes in reconnaissance and communication, radar and network interference. If you have the app FlightRadar24 here the link to the flight https://fr24.com/32a3cd18It's ID is off atm. But it turns it on when commercial flights get close. Can also see it's flight originating in the middle of the Mediterranean where the USS Gerald Ford is.
Yeah following the news of the airport pogrom was fucking wild. And of course the government rushed to blame "the West" and "banderovites". Though the sort of kind of association of the Telegram channel involved with that Ilya Ponomarev fellow (as noted in OP's top comment) complicates things. What a slimy bastard tbh

Yeah... It has been extremely disheartening to see how a lot of pro-Ukraine people are responding. I don't even expect people to be pro-Palestine or anti-Israel, I just wish I saw more people calling for their side to be better, because there's absolutely no excuse for a modern liberal democracy like Israel to do what they have been doing...
The car was turning around to flee

It's funny but it's just the principle... don't steal stuff. Somebody worked to buy that bike and that's their means of transportation and then you are bold enough to do it in front of the military. Yeah he deserves that ass kicking.
Oh crap, I'm an idiot.
The fact that we have to couch and clarify every single comment against occupation, apartheid and genocide of Palestinian people‚Ä¶Just shows how relevant and insidious Israeli public relations and spin around the world is.Nobody supports terrorists anywhere in the world.Other than those aligned with such.Unfortunately, some people in countries support occupation, apartheid, and genocide‚Ä¶If it aligns with their wants, needs, and interests.I believe that‚Äôs called EVIL.&gt;![gif](giphy|NISDky7DiUqAs9crvf|downsized)

Don't forget about their advanced conscript biomass system. Very effective I heard.
The pogrom in Dagestan is carried out by local Muslim minorities tho
You only do that if you're getting ready to do some heinous shit.
What I see is people rushing with mattresses
Unexpected Scooby-Doo, Jinkies!Guys it was just old man Abbas this whole time.
They‚Äôre just using ‚Äòbecause tunnels‚Äô as an excuse to exterminate the population.  It‚Äôs becoming more and more obvious.
Tbf it wasn't the Muscovites here, it was Dagestani Muslims. The former Pogromers are a lot less antisemitic than they used to be - I mean, look at Ukraine. It was the worst place to be a Jew during the Tzarist days and during WW2, but now it's one of the least antisemitic countries in Europe. Russia is definitely more antisemitic, though, with their Hitler-worshipping novellas and propaganda about the Jewish Nazis in the West.
Hate to break it to you, no ground invasion to end [INSERT TERRORIST/INSURGENT ORGANIZATION HERE] has succeeded in the Middle East. Well, succeeded in anything but radicalizing more to join the organization your trying to end or one like it.
Averaged across the Israeli population, each interceptor costs each citizen 1 cent. Hamas said they had 7000 missiles. If each Israeli citizens pays $70 then Hamas' entire missile stocks have been essentially neutralized. This is the biggest bargain in the history of warfare!
It's not bizarre, it's propaganda. Gaza is just the beginning. The next 10 years are going to be filled with massacres of civilian populations.
Eh, 2010 to like 2014 were pretty chill
No idea, but I wouldn't stand outside to find out.
U know how it is, someone unknown was forced to leave 1000 years ago, gives the right to vaguely related ppl 940 years later to take it back by force. /s
Yup.Plus the past decades of apartheid and occupation.
Isn‚Äôt religion great? Brings peace to mankind, right?
That's just fake news, if Spetsnaz had been involved they would have blown up the plane (and half the airport) and killed at least half of the passengers.And on a more serious note  Russia started a war because Ukraine was allegedly so full of Nazis that it had to be denazified before it became too much of a threat. Meanwhile in Russia mobs are marking down Jewish owned businesses and storming airports with murderous intentions because a plane with Jews landed there...
I agree. I still upvoted the comment, and I absolutely commend and encourage unapologetic support for Palestine in the face of "apolitical" calls for condemnation of violent  resistance from people who have never even heard of the Great March of Return. When I made my l my reply, their comment was being downvoted into the negative, and a part of me wasn't sure if some people hadn't misconstrued the comment, as unlikely as it may be.
killing civilians is the point, any hamas casualties are just a nice bonus to israel
These are the people doing pograms on Palestinians
They're arguably worse. Russia while bad never said any civilians east of the dnipro will be seen as enemy combatant and murdered
xxx x x x x x x x x x
Hamas is posting their videos but have no chance. One of the problems is it seems they are going after smaller ambushes and trying to capture IDF in the process. Like one of the videos showed them hitting a tank and running off with one of the crew.They're hidden all throughout the country. Not just under the Gaza strip. Which is why Israel is spread out all over the place because they can come out from anywhere.
Best of the best.

Having lived and worked in both Israel and further Occupied Palestine, it is absolutely ingrained that this is what you do.I recall reading the newspaper in Tel-Aviv (which is slightly less nightmarish) articles written about how Jewish people in America were given homes in New York and Los Angeles - which is absolutely ridiculous. (And other stories about how the most-watched television show in America was some Israeli talent show).  The state-run media in Israel is even worse than when I worked in the Gulf: which is saying a lot.It's an inundation from childhood onward that this is what you must do.
I think you missed two books I've listed that are by israeli historians. If you want a book that doesn't build its whole narrative on a biblical myth, you won't be able to find what you're looking for. Only on this app do people feel smarter than actual academics and researchers.
As a Native myself this brings me joy to see someone say this but anger and sadness because of the facts of the matter. ~~Notice how there were no upvotes?~~ The hypocrisy of some people can‚Äôt allow them to look inwards.Edit: things have since changed

I expect any sane reader to go check the things that they read and not trust redditors like myself :)It's not that hard to go up to Google, and search about the 'Jenin brigades', West bank terror activity, administrative detention in the west bank (for settlers and Palestinians), and even statistics about settler terrorism. I just give the readers the opportunity to understand that there're things that they may be not aware of, and encourage them to look for themselves to educate themselves and not from a one sided stance as I'm showing, or is it just to hard for redditors who like the word 'propaganda':)
Ha I have to say that with some people I know it‚Äôs quite the opposite but yeah I get your point.
excellent way to set up an ambush of a unarmed military platoon. Lure them out with an easy target.
Murdering whites? They murdered all minorities from all colours of skin and gassed them in camps. Didn‚Äôt you read the history books about the nazis

It really isn't unsustainable. If there's one thing you don't want to go to war with its the US economy. Which is why it's easier to cut off supply diplomatically.

The problem is they think it‚Äôs ok and until that happens nothing will change.
Mornings in Jenin - Susan Abulhawa
They don't care. This is not like Iraq or Afghanistan. Israel wants the Palestinian land. Killing off the Palestinians is a requirement to getting that land.
I have been running tests with google bard and it is abundantly clear that filters are being enacted to skew the truthfulness of the responses.
Spetsnaz managed to rescue people in danger and no one died? Fake
That‚Äôs a bold claim
You'd think that, but he works with the thief and it's all a distraction.
Yes children under the age of 17 need to find guns and kill Men who are religious fanatics while compartmentalizing the fact they'll be shot dead by Israel too under the assumption they're Hamas.That sounds logical.
Please look up the definition of genocide, then tell me why October 7th does not fit that definition. This should be interesting.....
I apologize! It is not gentleman like to boast or reveal personal financial matters/decisions. (Clown horn)
Every time I hear someone in the States talk about how, "the land was always theirs" (which, itself is factually inaccurate...).  I ask them whether they're willing to return their land, and home, FOR FREE to the Native Americans who first settled here.Guess what the answer ALWAYS is?
Maybe I have it backwards, it could have very well been my granddad and not my grandma.I wasn't very invested in him having an existential crisis over his inability to rob Palestinians of their land and I'm completely non-religious.

they were obviously hamas dont you know every one israel kills is hamas
A news report said that many of the passengers were from Dagestan returning home, another group were sick Dagestani children who had flown with their parents to Tel Aviv for medical care.
They tell these people to leave Gaza, but attack them while they try to leave. Are people seriously so dense that they can't see what's going on here?
That's what they *claim* but it's rarely every materialized.  No Arab countries want to be the ones to take in the Gaza refugees they claim to vehemently support.

First of all, a false statistic with no backing, please check your sources (e.g Instagram and reddit:()Here's the only sort of credibe source I could find about the topic, from a far left organization who opposes the occupation [source](https://www.btselem.org/administrative_detention/statistics)And most of the children just throw rocks and molotovs at the idf, not a terror act of course but shouldn't go unpunished.(the statistics shows only minors which 17 year old fall in that category, and there have been numerous shooting attacks I think and stabbing, which the most recent one is TODAY! In Jerusalem, the attacker is from east Jerusalem [source](https://www.timesofisrael.com/police-officer-seriously-injured-in-jerusalem-stabbing-assailant-shot-dead/)
How are they still able to launch rockets? I would expect the launcher to get blown off after 3 rockets considering the amount of airpower Israel has

"activists"....
This is evil. Plain and simple. They would do this to your home if they get the opportunity.
‚ÄúHad to leave‚Äù usually means fleeing from the country due to crimes committed, as they cannot be extradited back to US once they live in Israel
This may be too much, but now I‚Äôm just thinking about aerial sword battles between the f-15 waifus
they go an destroy palestinian homes / businesses and turn over he land to israeli settlers to build / expand
Yep, Terrorists get what they deserve
Also people who conducted them were called [Black hundreds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hundreds). its an interesting read.By the way Girkin like faction are usually supporters or members of Black hundreds.Also very funny how in modern times russia  tried to blame Ukraine for pogroms saying smth like - "Ukraine never existed but pogroms were Ukrainian !!"Most pogroms done by Black hundreds on territory of then colonized Ukraine   because of  Imperial decree of "Pale of settlement" concentrated them below this line.
Absolute *scum* of the earth.
Ok I have a serious question. Who the hell is filming thermal video images of the IDF conduction operations and is cutting it for a reddit video? What? How? opsec? Do you just use your phone usb to Merkava optics adaptor, plug it into the fire control system capture some tik toks and cut it in iMovie? The stuff from ukraine i understand, but this is an ongoing live military operation by one of the best armies of the West?
Yep...more Reddit woke censorship folks. Watch, this comment goes next
Yes, they did say that. But put in a bit of a reference frame, maybe? You first cited Iraq, then Afghanistan. 2 very different scenarios and also different from Israel's war against Hamas. But just as reference point, since you are throwing around numbers: The exact number of bombs dropped by the coalition for the war on terror in **Iraq** is unknown, but estimates range from **hundreds of thousands to millions**. According to a 2013 report by the Costs of War project at Brown University, the United States dropped an estimated 181,000 bombs on Iraq between 2003 and 2011. However, other estimates put the number much higher. For example, a 2014 report by Airwars, a non-profit organization that tracks civilian casualties in airstrikes, estimated that the coalition had dropped over 1 million bombs on Iraq since 2003.   Regarding Afghanistan: The US Air Force Central Command reported that coalition aircraft (excluding the Afghan Air Force) dropped 7,423 bombs in Afghanistan in 2019 alone. This was the highest number of bombs dropped in Afghanistan in a single year since the war began in 2001. The number of bombs dropped in Afghanistan has fluctuated over the years, but it has generally increased over time. In 2001, the first year of the war, coalition aircraft dropped just 1,030 bombs. In 2007, the number of bombs dropped increased to 5,101. And in 2009, the number of bombs dropped increased to 7,362.   There are a number of reasons why there were so much fewer bombs dropped in Afghanistan compared to Iraq.    1. The terrain of Afghanistan is much more difficult to bomb than the terrain of Iraq. Afghanistan is a mountainous country with a lot of valleys and gorges. This makes it difficult for aircraft to target and hit specific targets. Iraq, on the other hand, is a relatively flat country with few obstacles.    2. The Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan was different from the insurgency in Iraq. The Taliban was a more decentralized and mobile force than the Iraqi insurgency. This made it more difficult for coalition forces to track down and target Taliban fighters.    3. Coalition forces were more reluctant to use air strikes in Afghanistan because of the high risk of civilian casualties. Afghanistan is a densely populated country, and many Taliban fighters were operating in areas with large civilian populations. Coalition forces were worried that air strikes would kill or injure civilians.    4. Coalition forces were more focused on counter-insurgency operations in Afghanistan than on conventional warfare. Counter-insurgency operations involve working with the local population to win their support and build up the Afghan government. These operations are less reliant on air strikes than conventional warfare.    In contrast, the US-led invasion of Iraq was a conventional war. Coalition forces were focused on quickly defeating the Iraqi army and toppling the government of Saddam Hussein. This type of warfare is more reliant on air strikes.    As a result of all of these factors, coalition forces dropped far fewer bombs in Afghanistan than they did in Iraq.    In addition to the above, here are some other possible reasons for the difference in the number of bombs dropped in Afghanistan and Iraq:    The US-led invasion of Iraq was a much larger and more complex operation than the invasion of Afghanistan.  The Iraqi army was much larger and better equipped than the Afghan army.  The US-led coalition had more troops and aircraft available in Iraq than in Afghanistan.  The US-led coalition had more intelligence on Iraqi targets than on Afghan targets.  The US-led coalition was more willing to use air strikes in Iraq than in Afghanistan, due to the lower risk of civilian casualties.  It is important to note that the number of bombs dropped is not a perfect measure of the intensity of a war. Other factors, such as the type of bombs used and the accuracy of the bombing, are also important. However, the number of bombs dropped is a useful indicator of the overall level of violence in a war.&amp;#x200B;In conclusion: If you have good intel on your targets and are very much decided to root out your enemy, then you arrive at 6k bombs in 10 days.
What‚Äôs the trustworthy source?
I've always wondered about this. While the Iron Dome intercepts and destroys rockets, which pose a significant destructive potential, there's still the matter of debris. How hazardous is that debris?
In the background, I hear my Dad saying "Ohhhhh, someone's about to catch a solid case of boots in their ass".
Secretly?There's no secret. You can't cry fowl when the cops come to raid your home after stashing their drugs.Plus said people are using ole mum and pop as shields while still shooting at everyone else.There is no secret "base" safe zone kids use while playing.You can't just launch rockets or store ammo anywhere and receive no consequences. That's a legal target... Even by "UN" standards. Negotiate with what... Someone runs up and stabs you runs away and then asks... "Woah guy... Wtf you don't want to talk this through? You're an asshole!!"Then goes right back to trying to stab you.
Let's not forget the Sykes-Picot agreement. Giving shit that doesn't belong to you to someone it doesn't belong to either.
It's not. But let's make it a more direct comparison:Imagine you live in a city of 2 million people and a gang across town shoots up a police station and kills some cops, so the cops respond by bombing several homes, killing your family, and claiming that they had to because the gang is hiding among the population and the only way to fight back is to just mass murder civilians.Imagine people you don't even know are hiding weapons in tunnels under your neighborhood and the police just bomb every house and hope they collapse the tunnels, would you defend them? If they destroyed your home and killed your family and didn't even give you a chance to evacuate because they don't know if you'll warn the gang members, would you still defend them murdering your innocent family?And then there's the bombing of shelters and evacuation routes. Imagine they do warn you and your family does pack up and leave on the designated evacuation route, but the route is getting bombed on a daily basis and the police claim they don't know if gang members are evacuating too so they have to! Imagine you survive and get to a shelter at a school or a hospital and then it gets bombed and the police say gang members were probably hiding under the shelters and using you as a shield. Would you still side with the police for mass murdering civilians that did everything they were told and peacefully abandoned their homes so the police could destroy them and seize their land?It is trivially easy to put yourself in the shoes of a Palestinian and immediately recognize that what Israel is doing is morally indefensible. No sane, rational person can arrive at any other conclusion.Especially when you consider that money is fucking genociding Israelis! Hamas' effectiveness is pitiful and Israelis only account for 5% of all deaths in the conflict to date. Claiming that Israel must tolerate genocide of its people in order to respect human rights and not commit war crimes is an absolutely asinine take.
The biggest facepalm is that they themselves wrote the book in which they call themselves "chosen".  ü§îAdherents then go on to point to that same book as an evidentiary source of their "choseness". ü§îü§îReligion sucks, it's nothing but self-serving nonsense - ALL of it.
The worst part is that I am tempted to blow off a lot of the ugliest things in this world by just saying "cunts gonna cunt, right?" But the action you just described is being subsidized by my personal tax dollars.
Pretty weak ied. I blow up bigger stuff on 4th of July
Only 8 ? RUAF is slacking recently :/
ZionIsts bastards! It‚Äôs amazing they don‚Äôt even see that this is going to come back and burn them badly in the future.
Interesting as Pakistan never thinks the same for Azad Kashmir, which was build on Indian land. Hypocrisy.
Look Russia. Proper combined arms and armor formations executed as if they were trained/lead properly.
Rampaging?
Clearly Hamas was hiding in the trunk.
Uhh homie have you been sleeping? Israel's own news networks ran the story that the government was warned and chose to ignore the warnings about the attack. The US and Egypt warned them.This one is entirely on Israel. They legitimately let this happen and are now acting shocked.
No. If you try to hold them accountable, you‚Äôd be antisemitic.
You are hostage : panicThey sent special forces to rescue you : calmThe special force they sent is russians special forces : calmThe special force they sent is russians special forces : panic

Everyday Israel indiscriminately bombs Gaza the less I believe that securing the hostages is even a goal.At this rate they have probably bombed the Hostages a fair bit.
That can't be right. IIRC Judaism is passed on the mother's side. If your mom is Jewish, so are you. Maybe I am mistaken
Exactly. The question is who controls the tool, and what agenda do they have?In this case, as is almost always the case, the answer is Capital controls the tool and the tool serves the Capitalist agenda.To quote Lenin:&gt;‚ÄúFreedom of the press‚Äù in bourgeois society means freedom for the rich systematically, unremittingly, daily, in millions of copies, to deceive, corrupt and fool the exploited and oppressed mass of the people, the poor.&gt;&gt;\- V. I. Lenin. (1917). [How to Guarantee the Success of the Constituent Assembly](https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/sep/28.htm)
This "country" only exists because The western world has interests in the Middle East. Israel is a political product it is not a heritage it is not a place that combine the an ethnic Group. The israel identity is based on the Jewish Europians who fled from the Nazi regime. This is a RELIGIOUS group not an ETHNIC group. By their beliefs Jerusalem is the holy land but There is no justification to Govern and to have Authority of this Land. JEWISH people recognize since Years that the Israeli goverment is a shame to the Judaistic Religion.
There was a Hamas base under the seats.
Lol i like how that guy saw all those soldiers running and decided he actually did not want to go that way
how is my hard earned money that i donate gonna help the humanitarian issue if they wont allow any resources in at all? and why is it always donate here for the governments to call cease fire vs sign this petition. Not everyone has the will or way to donate but everyone can put down a signature
Well, they exist because if the Palestinians try and remove them, the IDF will kill the Palestinians.
So colonisers
Multiple Israeli news outlets carried the story, but Israel let this happen. Their Government was warned by Egypt and the US that an attack was coming and they literally told them to leave them alone. They knew something was going to happen and left their army in the West bank helping illegally settle Palestinian land.Israel does this every few years to start another bombing campaign.
Spetsnaz rescued people without killing everyone involved?  Truly they are learning
All the excuses Putin used in Ukraine were learned from Israel's playbook for Gaza. Hit a shopping mall full of innocent people? Ukraine was hiding arms there, it's a legit military target. Unjustified military invasion? We're actually purging Nazis. The only difference is while normal people can see through Putin's bullshit, apparently when it comes to Gaza it's all seen as true.
The audacity ! How dare you calling these side damage as war crimes you anti semitic . The international community support destroying "Hamas" and freeing "hostages" ./S
During the Nakba, israeli terrorists would poison wells so that Palestinians couldn't return to their villages.
Having redundancies is good in the military, don't feel bad champ.
A god of war and death.  It is why all of the Abrahamic religions are seemingly compelled to murder each other over how to worship the god they all worshipIt is the only logical conclusion if gods are real.
Typical. Tell the lie, big and repeatedly and it becomes the truth.
Israel goes back to waiting for another chance to let the Hamas "slip" through after being warned for almost a month that something was going to happen, so they can do this all over again.It's the clear historical track record.
No it's not. And that's why the fucking International Criminal Court is reviewing charges against Israel. Regardless of what *you* think, it's a war crime to mass murder civilians and claim they just had to kill them to get to the bad guys. That's illegal. Your opinion doesn't change that.
Well, no elevators were involved.
Especially since Israel‚Äôs next turn move is CLUSTER BOMB
So if your family were held hostage and the cops showed up, didn't even try to negotiate, and just fired straight through your loved ones to kill the criminals, you'd defend the cops?
The iceing on the cake was watching one of them pistol whip one of the mob in the head while he‚Äôs on the ground that causes an ND that looks to go into the shin of the other Russian soldier right next to him
Oh they can't get anything from the homes. Not even medicine.
As per Reddit, Russia is running out of everything, so probably wrong place to ask. In actuality, that is hard to know. I personally talked to some Russian people  who laugh at such claims, but it's also anecdotal. I'd assume it's difficult to run out of something when you posses resources Russia does and have China as your backdoor supermarket.
No! Bad dog! You missed the point! Nothing Hamas does makes it fucking legal to mass murder civilians! Get that through your head! This is not up for debate. There is no excuse Israel could give that would justify their actions in Gaza. How are you not fucking getting this?Here: Imagine you live in a city of 2 million people and one day a gang across town shoots up a police precinct and kills some cops. Now imagine the police responded by bombing the city, destroying your home, killing your family, and saying "they have a right to defend themselves against the violent gang that attacked them, but the gang is hiding in the city so we have no choice but to indiscriminately bomb the place."Would that fly with you? Your whole family being murdered and your home destroyed because people you don't even fucking know attacked the police? Would you side with the police if gang members secretly built a shelter under your land and the police just bombed your home with your family in it hoping to collapse the gang bunker underneath it, without warning your family or giving them a chance to evacuate?Would you defend the police if members of the gang took your family hostage to use as human shields and the police didn't even try to negotiate and just shot through your family to kill the gang members?This is what Israel is actively doing in Gaza. It's murdering innocent families and claiming they had to because there were terrorists hiding among them, underneath them, and behind them.
They are fighting all Palestinians. They want more land.
.. you want to arm a radical  theocratic religious group? Just think about that for a second
And yes the sirens go every time the trajectory is calculated to reach you - it's local. Sometimes you can hear the sirens from the nearby neighbourhoods but the sound wont be as strong, so usually you wouldn't take shelter in this case. We also have apps to alert us. If there's an infiltration it's a different siren and it will verbally say there's been a breach. Otherwise it's the red alert siren.
rare spetsnaz w
Was a genuine question I just anticipated a better answer
Truman, against his staff telling him not to, recognized Israel as a state.  Everyone told him not to do this.   &gt;Truman made the call on May 14, 1948, following the declaration of the new state by David Ben-Gurion, Israel‚Äôs first prime minister. It was an important symbolic move by the Truman administration, although the United States maintained its arms embargo against all participants in the Arab-Israeli War that immediately followed.  https://forward.com/news/546537/state-department-told-truman-recognize-israel-75-arab-jewish/
Restoration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire is non-negotiable.
Any technology can cause harm as it can cause good. It is all dependent on how a tool is used, yes.
They told them to evacuate!! ^to ^the ^‚Äùsafe‚Äù ^zone ^that ^they ^are ^currently ^bombing
They think this is going to make them look good in front of the whole world! Guess what it's not!!! It'll have the opposite effect because now people will imagine the worst atrocious things being done because I mean after everything that's happened over the last several weeks how could people not imagine the absolute worst.
And when there is Hamas, 8000 people die

Notice that most of the ones that don't happen to be the furthest ones away from it. But the west gets to decide everything in the world right?Your blindly western-centered view of the world is incredibly arrogant and ignorant and makes westerners look like fools.  Take a long hard look at your worldview and maybe start to do something more than mindlessly parrot what western media and governments tell you to think.
Well the point isn't really about AI, but about technology in general, and moreso about what purposes those tools serve.For example, an entirely human creation was the "killed" in Israel and "dead" in Gaza distinction that the BBC and other major news outlets ran with when reporting on the conflict.People were *being killed* in Israel, meanwhile they were just *dropping dead*(??) in Gaza. The way this conflict is framed is deliberately designed to give you a certain impression that is ultimately pro-Israel.
Do you think 8000 is accurate? At this point I can't imagine how it's not way more
Depends where you are. Near the gaza strip, 15 seconds. Where I live it's 90 seconds and to get to us they have to use long range missiles rather than rockets so it's less frequent (maybe a few times a day versus continuously like in the gaza envelope), but the missiles can do a lot more damage. We manage, it's definitely not business as usual here despite people putting on a brave face. The country is still in a state of shock since oct 7. I am lucky since I work from home so, and thanks to covid lots of schools do zooms now. With the rockets you kind of learn the patterns so you time it for when you can go out, shower, poop, etc to be not caught off guard. I don't sleep in the bunker overnight since I am a very light sleeper and 90 seconds is usually more than enough time to get downstairs, but the kids do sleep there. For other people it depends, some people don't have shelters so they use the stair cases or the public bomb shelters. When you go out you sort of scout for the nearest safe spots. Like, if I walk my dog, I keep an eye for public bomb shelters or concrete walls to take shelter by. If you're caught in the open the most  important thing is to get low and get away from any vehicles since those will blow up.
Natural Zionist settler's behavior, they have been doing this for the last 75 years.
Or a decoy, we know Ukraine has at least some MALDs
\*you have summoned the horde\*
Oh wow Israel committing another war crime, they are just as evils as Hamas.
Fun fact, this is just a variation on a theme where oppressed identities are politicized.For example:* Being a man is "normal". *Just being* a woman is political.* Being straight is "normal". Just *being* gay is political.* Being white is "normal". Just *being* black is political. (Remember BLM? The implied "too" and the people who just couldn't get it and said things like "All Lives Matter" in response?)* etc. etc. etc.The point is that there is a dominant ruling class that has a narrative and an ideology behind it, and any deviation from that script is "political". Because "politics" is about *changing* the world.So in this framework, it's *a*political to assert Israel's right to be free (and defend itself) but it's *political* to assert the same for Palestine.As a follow-up, this is why centrists and just right-wingers. They uphold the status quo through complacency and inaction (usually *because* the system is set up to favour them, overall). Marginalized communities do not have the privilege of being apolitical, because politics is *happening to them* every day whether they like it or not.
He's claiming on October 7th the Israelis killed their own citizens and Hamas didn't have the means to destroy a home because all they had were machine guns and grenade launchers, completely leaving out the fact that Hamas claims they fired over 5000 rockets into Israel on October 7th.    I'm not sure why you're just casually waving away the fact that this video is fine because other news media reports for money and views.  This isn't news media, it's a content creator using fake information to monetize the war for themselves.  You see how effective it is because you didn't even question it until I posted.
When are we going to stop pretend that israel isn‚Äôt deliberately targeting civilians?
Thats not how it works. Shooting dummy shells at concrete and mountaints wont do much. Using munitions that are designed to penerate concrete before exploding is night and day.
I thought your question was genuine but apparently you only want to shit on the authors. They're pretty objective, even the ones with Arab names. How about you actually read one of those books before you give your feedback? Pathetic.
Mindlessly repeating all of the Israeli propaganda that they themselves refuse to offer proof for is not "being fully informed." It's just being a propaganda mouthpiece.
Pogrom is a russian word for a reason
Punjabi Hindus pretending to be Arab and sometimes turkic Muslims shaming their own relatives on the eastern and western side and now in support of Palestinians. Do you see the irony here??Occupying pagan lands in the name of another religion and culture, while subjecting your own to hate and praising someone who you're not even related to just because they're of your same religion.lmao
These are war crimes I hope the international community holds Israel accountable
Half the people being detained in the West Bank are children under 15. How the fuck are they linked to terrorists?

My favorite part was when the black pixels started chasing the red pixel.
I mean these are all books that take a pro Palestine stance. Of course if you read them you will lean in that direction. I'd say your position would be more valuable if you had a range of books and were able to find some incorrect
This is the stuff you love to see.

It's just pure uncaring greed.My dad has been a 'christian' all his life. He found out we have some Jewish heritage on my grandmas side. I think through one of those ancestry DNA things Either way, out of the blue he decided to convert to Judaism and wanted to move Israel.Unfortunately for him, whatever organisation that sorts all this out wouldn't let him because being a deeply patriarchal society, his heritage came from his mother's side and not his dads, which means he isn't considered a 'real jew' and isn't allowed to hold the properties in Israel or access any of the deeper religious text.He spent months raging he was being denied his heritage and right to go to Israel and claim land.I just sort of looked at him like, dude WTF. Needless to say we haven't talked much since then

This is where my Internet trail is gonna fuck me but... I don't feel bad for Israelis. They aren't from Israel. They move to Palestine from Europe mostly. They sign up to take Palestinian homes. The government gives them money to be there and encourages migration. The United States gives Israel billions from our spending bill under foreign aid and Americans are fine and dandy with it. Israel has free education, healthcare, job placement, stipends for recent settlers and housing vouchers. But Americans can't get any of that with our tax dollars. All Israel has to do is spend the money we give them on our weapons. So our money gets funneled into the military in more ways than just spending it on the defense budget. How could I possibly feel bad for a group of people who sign up to live in a war zone, getting free money from the government so they can propagate Zionist ideals, people who vote in officials that cause turmoil in the region for religious reasons? Send me to reddit jail.
what is he yelling at the end?
Netanyahu has killed more Palestinians in 2 weeks, than Putin Killed Ukrainians in 2 years.

And they wonder why Palestinians hate them.This is not all Israelis mind you, and no, Hamas shouldn't conflate these ethnic cleansing Israelites with all Israelis. But if the government is going to blame all Palestinians for the actions of Hamas, presumably for allowing Hamas to exist, then I don't really see how that's any different than Hamas blaming all of Israel for allowing this ethnic cleansing to continue unabated.

FWIW, It's always been perplexing to me that one country could summarily decide to annex and claim land belonging to other countries. WTH?!

I‚Äôm sure the IDF is racing to put out a video explaining how this was actually a hamas tank.Hah, riiight. They will never acknowledge this.
In US people pay that money for ambulance and hospital stay.
What is this title saying?
great conclusion batman, would you like to share the information confirming it was just a residential building filled with civilians and not potentially.... say.... a military target in any possible way?
The last time I saw a video like this, it was Russians firing on a Ukrainian civilian vehicle. Elderly couple just trying to leave. Lawlessness of wars like this paint very clear pictures of the broken morals of the leadership.
Why TF would anyone leave a faster means of transportation than those who are chasing are using?

Not quite sure isreal was built on others land. Palestine was never a country, it was Judea the same Judea in the bible before!, and ever since been occupied by empires, be it Roman, Otterman &amp; British. Almost 90% of Arab Palestinian people in Isreal came in during the British rule from nearby countries predominantly Egypt. The British gave the Arabs 80% of the country in the two state agreements, but the Arabs rejected it, went to war, and lost over and over again. Isreal has offered a two state solution on 5 occasions each time rejected by the Arabs. The issue is not the land its the Arabs under Hamas that want to exterminate the Jews  they even say this. This is nothing more than mass antisemitism.
So there is a siren every time the system detects a launch from the other side? How long do you have to get to shelter? How often does this happen? How do you get anything done if you have to run downstairs every 30 minutes all day long. Do you sleep down there overnight?  Kind of always been curious about the day to day, not trolling
I mean how Israel became a state, yeah no idea about that. But from being forced to go to church for several years and reading the Bible cover to cover, I know how the Abram/Abraham story diverged into Isaac and Ishmael... i.e Jewish people and Arabs. It's crazy that even Herzl himself said the Palestinians have been in their land for hundred of years and doesn't see them moving away. They organize a meeting, they boldly chant "Palestine, next year", send young dudes... that go to a foreign land and proclaimed it theirs.. now the world watches while they try to massacre the actual owners of the land because they're way more advanced and have the backing of countries hoping to gain a little bit of that Godly favor when the right time comes.
They are called ‚Äúself hating Jews‚Äù
Religion in 2023 is ridiculous, shows that nothing has really evolved on earth.
I'm still not convinced that is the correct pronunciation of 'bona fides'. From when I saw this on here days ago.
Not sure why these guys like to stick rifles out of windows.
Man should've kept the bike
This video is people running from a bus there‚Äôs no evidence of them invading anything
But let‚Äôs not pretend they‚Äôre some fringe part of Israeli society. They are core to Israel and its identity. This is a state policy, not some one odd ideology that they try to contain.
All news media does reporting for money and views. How is that any different from the misinformation pushed via larger networks fox News and CNN.  I'm asking what in this specific video is false. Dude makes assumptions based on weapons possessed by hamas forsure, but how do you know this was a hamas attack on its own civilians?
Yea its called moderation
It‚Äôs funny when you see the ultra Orthodox Jews criticising Israel. Does that make them anti semites  aswell I wonder ?
The cost of war is ugly‚Ä¶it‚Äôs sad people that live under corrupt leaders must suffer. Israel has no choice but to destroy everything Hamas is connected to. It‚Äôs the only true way to end this thousand year war.
Honnestly, this is a no win situation.  If you vote Republican, their campaign is funded by arms dealersIf you vote Democrat, their compagin is also funded by arms dealers.  The bombs that are dropping over Gaza today came from Obama's $38B Israel Aid package he signed back in 2016.
It is oversimplification but it is true. Then there is this whole promised land of Judah or w/e. It is way deeper than you think.
Israel acting a little Russian.  It‚Äôs hard to feel sorry for them when you see stuff like this.
When you are escorted and guarded by IDF soldiers and handed assault rifles by the Israeli government, who is going to stop you? Source: https://www.timesofisrael.com/ben-gvir-says-10000-assault-rifles-purchased-for-civilian-security-teams/
Nah we are upset the governments just don‚Äôt listen (and on this matter they‚Äôll throw anyone who opposes behind the Sun), and they are mocked on every Arab political comedy show.
I can understand a tank shooting a civilian vehicle that is headed toward the tank as they may be a suicide bomber but the fact that they were trying to turn around. This was uncalled for.
Well actually they want you to know, that's why the genociders literally say that in their videos, posts and press conferences
Some type of AR?
That‚Äôs why you need to reprogram the population after you force Hamas and PIJ to an unconditional surrender. This was done to Germany and it worked out brilliantly.
There is a chance that the Russians are lying. But I believe that Ukraine was also given missiles that can imitate the radar signatures of other missiles. Or it can be a mixture of both. Or neither and the Russians  really didshoot down 8 Stormshadows. Pick your adventure.
Friendly reminder that CAS doesn‚Äôt mean that plane has to be close, just the ordinance. No MANPADS are realistically going to be able to hit the Israeli planes flying at 30,000 ft. It‚Äôs a Turkey shoot, but the turkeys are houses.
Yep. I've seen plenty of "comments" on Instagram by private accounts with less than 50 followers (and following hundreds) with generic tone-deaf Israel support. It's bizarre.
If only the idiot had a way to move faster than someone running.
Wait, that's not at all appropriate.
which books have you read that you would recommend?
The video has too many pixels
I‚Äôm curious, how do you know they were civilians and not combatants not wearing uniforms.
So happy that another tiktoker has shared their thoughts
If you don't acknowledge the people dying, then it's not actually happening!!
9/11 gave the American people enough justification to travel to the opposite side of the world and wage 20 years of war.  I think 10/7 was more than enough to justify the IDF going 10 miles to defeat their enemy.
Haha, right. And I banged 8 supermodels yesterday...
What kind of omniscient being places his fave people in a place where they are surrounded on all sides by their "enemies"? Seems kinda like an oversight, no?
Sadly, this content creation channel has popped up strictly to make money.  The video itself is inaccurate, and they're making content like this to get views so they can monetize their YouTube channel.  So many people are amplifying it, it's at least the third repost of it here in this subreddit.  They have other videos they've created around the Ukraine/Russia war just to try to make money as well, it's pretty shameful.
I don't because, and I said, I don't know the Israeli's rules of engagement.
What are you talking about? That car was clearly a Hamas base /s
IDF is making some atheist tonight!
Except backed by the US
The emperor protects
Habsburg empire is back! Habsburg empire stands beside Israel.
I hope he got away lol just a bike. Bunch of goofy asses chasing him
Don't forget them pouring concrete into wells so they can't use those either
Why no tanks?
God damn an entire mob of people who wrestled bears growing up. I‚Äôd be shitting bricks.
Wait wait wait wait waitI'm watching a documentary on YouTube right now about how Israel came about... it says some Jewish dude called Theodor Herzl scoped out Uganda (under British rule) and Argentina as potential destination for the Jewish people to seek refuge. Then he traveled to Palestine and said "This place is dope"... It might be an oversimplification but I wish I'm joking
Seems a bit high for a storm shadow to me.. ü§î well the Russians won't lie.. üòÇ
A general threatened me that if I bombed a civilian, I would be court marshaled. I wasn't even doing anything. I didn't have anything to do with ordinance. Lol!Although arbitrary, I did respect that.
Not sure if the clip is accurate to what the title is, but the authority there is extremely biased towards Israelis, not legal, but doesn't matter.
I‚Äôm donating a $100 to Israel in your name friend.
Seriously. Trying to determine if this was recorded using a russet potato, or a toothbrush.
The Israeli army has been launching airstrikes on civilian areas in Gaza since the beginning of the conflict, claiming that Hamas may have been using civilians as shields. However, during the ground invasion, there have been reports of civilian casualties without a clear, obvious explanation for their occurrence.
Guerilla warfare with a touch of war crimes
That's so fucked up
First the came to take the Jew - I wasn't a Jew so I did nothing
At least the one guy thought to jump on the bike instead of running.
Any source for that?
Thank you for this info!

The irony here is that Pakistan only exists because British India allowed them to exist. They drew up some lines on a map and sent the Sunni Muslims walking.
Okay well you are hypothetical are implying Israel has broken rules of engagement,  you got examples and proof that international laws on rules of engagement have been broken?
Men and religion, the cause of all wars
Hiding behind kids.
So we're just gonna post random clips to bandwagon off of this war now? This isn't even a freakout.
There's ieds in the west bank? I thought the war was just in Gaza?
War crimes
Israeli Air Force performing Close Air Support in support of ground forces strikes multiple militants very close to Israeli Defence Force ground forces!
Is there any chance of Russia running out of AA missiles? Like those missiles are expensive and pretty hard to manufacture, no?
Well that definitely remind me of a couple of videos in Ukraine. These guys even realized and tried to turn around and flee. Unless I see a video of them pulling out guns... but doubt that
Almost certainly something along the lines of a palestinian child threw a rock at an adult jewish man who had just shot his father in front of him for daring to live in his legal home in the west bank
Wait, wtf?  How is this legal?
You get debris but the Iron Dome is suppose to direct them somewhere safe, sometimes it misses. We get a few debris with every barrage these days. You can usually tell by the sound. We're supposed to wait 10 minutes after the boom before leaving shelter.
People who lived thousands of miles away demanding Israel to do nothing is laughable. I can only imagine the fear and horror thousands in Israel felt that day and the disgust of IDF troops coming across the sites of attacks in the days after. The IDF aren‚Äôt parading dead women through Tel Aviv or Jerusalem to cheering crowds so they still have the moral high ground.
Is Hamussy better?
Reddit it is so weird getting down voted for being concerned about civilians being bombed.
These launchers are well concealed and don't need operators to work, instead running on times. Finding and destroying them is nearly impossible.
Hamas isn't in jenin, literally nothing to do with it.  This is just Israel
Shame Palestine was deleted as a country after ww2
Fair question.
And so is the other side...Last I checked firing rockets into cities is a war crime... So is purposeful kidnapping of civilians or driving by and gunning down the elderly at a bus stop. Last I checked Hamas is the defacto gov't...So what's the difference between firing rockets into cities and dropping bombs? or shooting arty? So now we can go round and round and end right back at the same place. So now you see the issue.
Religion is the foundation of most  world governments. When your foundation is built on lies it's bound to fail.
"This attack didn't happen in vacuum"
You usually get a few pieces falling down with every launch. It's why you're supposed to wait 10 minutes in shelter after the boom. We can usually tell by the sound if it was a clean interception or if something hit the ground.
Emutopia is at it again
Yes, the first year of the war is more than 12 years before the start of any chart on this page. You‚Äôre missing well over a decade of data. Do you even know when the US entered Afghanistan?I‚Äôm trying to helpfully correct you so that next time you repeat something you heard from an activist, you don‚Äôt repeat something that‚Äôs completely false. You‚Äôre welcome.
Do they not realise this is literally just creating more extremists if anything? Bulldozing peoples houses and bombing the hell out of them isn‚Äôt the way to make people feel anything other than hatred towards you.
Hamas shill Hamas shill burn in hell Hamas shill
It was 100% intentional. IDF is no better than Hamas when it comes to civilian targeting

A family was killed.
learn how punctuation works, terror supporter. Will make your pathetic attempts at propaganda a bit more effective!
it‚Äôs so funny you say that because right under you is someone justifying it.
Missiles intercepted by Russian ground equipment
How can they ‚Äúvalidate‚Äù the numbers when the Ministry is their only source?
I remember being 11-12 when the western news explained the conflict  the explanation was that zionists claimed the land as they had been forced to leave over a 1000 years ago .  Even to a child it seemed to a stupid claim
no you sperg, hamass fucked around and palestinian civvies found out.
No worries guys, it was just Hamas in disguise right?
Or cut the middleman out and just have predator drones monitoring them. They can observe and react if needed.
Ive seen so many people call for the genocide of an entire people lately, it makes me sick to my stomach. Those people are no better than the nazi scum in ww2. History will remember them.
Another day another Israeli war crime.
Please use the correct vernacular. These are thieves not settlers.
What about the debris? Someone must've been hit on the head at some point by the thousands of fragments that's been raining down for weeks??
They're ancestors weren't there any more then any other peoples ancestors.  It's a bunch of lies perpetuated but land thieves.  Zionists are disgusting
How is it misinformation?
It‚Äôs a cunning trick, to create the environment whereby it‚Äôs impossible to criticise without the accusation of anti-semitism, which immediately shuts down the conversation of whether actions are justifiable.
As you knock down a strawman. I never said any of it was acceptable. What do you think the Israelis should do? How do they neutralize Hamas so their citizens don‚Äôt get murdered?
That‚Äôs what all Europeans should do in every capital city with the empty luxurious apartments.
More like... Kidnapped your mother and put her in front of them while they shoot other people at the same time.Plus they're not going to let go of said mum... And they're not going to stop shooting other people.Or on occasion said mum is willingly and knowingly let them keep their drug stash in the house. Sure she's not dealing or shooting back, but she said "Okay but you boys you that room only." Then crying fowl when the cops come and raid the place.
Babies =/= Hamas.
Woah. Why are there only men in this video?
How did they ‚Äúaudit‚Äù the records when they have no sources of info but the Ministry itself? The same ministry who announced Israel bombed a hospital and there were 500 casualties when it turned out to be untrue. Unreliable.
"settlers" are actually land thieving scum of the earth
They don't wanna wake the neighbors.
Man fucking war criminals. They get away with this because they are an ally of the west.
Either way I think they did get one of the missiles unfortunately. Either way, something Russian just blew up and they didn‚Äôt intercept all of them

This is horrific
Being told you are the chosen people your whole life is a hell of a moral license.
I love Reuters but they don‚Äôt have access to good sources right now. The UN and WHO are relying on the Gaza Health Ministry which is not a good source. The UN hasn‚Äôt even condemned Hamas attacking civilians so how can we pretend they‚Äôre impartial?
Wagner PMC's former military leader had literal SS uniform markings tattooed on his body.  He named the company after Hitler's favorite composer.  Just how blatantly a Nazi does someone have to be to get called one in Russia?
Israel has admitted to dropping over 6,000 bombs with the first ten days.
You don't need to worry about human rights if you just don't consider them humans. One wild trick that the IDF doesn't want you to know about.
I never said that I agree with Hamas's actions. This is about the rules of engagement. We are also going to avoid hypotheticals. If this did that then this would happen isn't applicable.
Pieces of garbage
Yes. Why you supported the Hamas. Tell me. Why you are Happy when you and your Hamas Brother killed civilians? Tell me. Whats wrong with you. This is a animal/terrorist and you supported this.
I wonder if everyone just has shit falling into their yard 24/7 or how the day-to-day goes.
a palestinian reporter in gaza. if you look through the comments you will find a twitter video of him talking about it.
According to wikipedia, the 2014 war with Hamas was 6 weeks long and they fired about 4500 rockets during that period. They fired 5000 rockets on the very first day of this one. That's fucking insane
Brilliant, think about it.-Doesnt need any of that expensive crap to lock on target -Doesnt need ammo, so its cheaper, lighter and less reliant on suplly lines-cannot run out of ammo-Stealthy because it doesnt make noise-Requires minimum maintanance, only sharpening-the enemy wont see it coming-honorable-Lord Garmadon is coping and seething rn
I saw a story, years ago, about an illegal settlement on the West Bank. The Israelis were forced to abandon it. But before they did, they bulldozed the homes so Palestinians couldn't live in them. You are right...vile.
Russians are white, Palestinians are brown.
I love to see all that open space where Hamas could have set up base instead of setting up in the heart of Gaza.
Funny how this video doesn't show what they are shooting at. Considering the video before this in my feed was an Israeli tank blowing up a car full of civiliansEdit: Video I'm talking about. https://www.reddit.com/r/socialism/s/ZNIdubH97FY'all are brainwashed if you think that this looks like the car was attempting anything hostile
Religion = rot. Fuck Zionism. Free Palestine
You‚Äôre repeating propaganda. This phrase:&gt; Dropping more bombs in ten days than we did in a year in Afghanistan doesn't strike me as being selectiveis categorically false. Whoever you heard that from was not telling you the truth. We dropped around 17,500 bombs on Afghanistan in the first 70-something days of the war (end of 2001). Here‚Äôs an indication https://www.cfr.org/blog/tracking-eight-years-airstrikes-afghanistan. We were talking single-thousands in Gaza. And if you want to talk unprecedented, note the 10,000 rockets Hamas itself brags about firing into Israeli population centers while this is going on. Gaza has a tunnel network to deal with under an urban area that has been continuously warned to evacuate for the last 2 weeks. Cities do not look nice after a ground invasion in a general war, this time you just get to watch it as it happens.
Why do Russians always claim to shoot down 100% of targets. The lies are just comical at this point.
But if you sat anything bad about the Isreals its antisemitic. War crimes included. Ain't it funny that you can be anti Semitic to people who aren't even Semitic.
Wow imagine if you had your family and tried to turn around. Scary stuff.
Religion is going to be the downfall of everything.
There is no Hamas in west bank what is the excuse?
These are the people who say their religion is peaceful it's a lie
It's a higher karma minimum now so accounts are getting slapped after commenting
who are you to call Hamas a terror group, I've yet heard any pro PS called them that
They come from Europe and other places lol. I'm not even joking. I've seen a similar video of some US Jewish citizen that came all the way from New York city "because he had to leave" and took over some old couple's house. "If I don't steal it someone else will" he said.

Who thinks the conflict between Israelis and Palestinians is the weeks old? That's remarkably ignorant.
What are kind of ordinance are they using?  Goes through the wall and goes off on a delay?
It's actually is really difficult to watch. Sometimes you see really young teenagers going around on motorcycles in the middle of the night following fully armed vehicles and soldiers around all night long, I'm talking LARGE groups with kids as young as 13-14. I speak a bit of arabic so I can follow up on their trash talk, a few weeks back I saw a bunch of them (older, like 17ish)  straight up bullying this one teenager to light a firecracker and throw it at an armed vehicle (one of those huge flaming ones you put on birthday cakes). I'm pretty sure the kid got shot in the leg. They ran and left him behind, or at least the cameraman did. Didn't manage to record it, happened in a splitsecond. No death reports the next day so maybe it was a rubber round? Idk. I imagine IDF intelligence ALSO monitors these lives.
Can someone explain to me how these settlers exist? Is there just a warehouse in Israel full of homeless Israelis that get a notification of a vacant Palestinian home?
Really?  When people and the government backing them see others as less than human, it's real easy to understand what's going through these people's minds.
ok, I see you have conceded defeat. Better luck next time with your BS
This case happened this year next to the Santo Ant√¥nio de P√°dua War Shooting, in the northwest of the state of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. When being chased by around 30 soldiers, the man dropped his bicycle and ran away.According to the person responsible for War Shooting, at the time of the theft, training was taking place for a graduation that would be held the following day, when Army Day is celebrated. That's why there were several soldiers on the street at that time.After the man dropped the bike, the soldiers ran for a few more meters, but gave up on continuing the chase.

This has zombie vibes
Exactly right. BHI are a pretty small and niche group that are relatively unpopular, but they hate Jews and a whole lot of other ppl. It‚Äôs a belief system based on hate, prejudice, and ignorance.
I was going to say those intercept missile are a bit to high for storm shadow. Ukraine launched a bunch of drones, which could be what the high intercepts were. Russias MOD should just rename itself to 'FOS' full of shit.
Morally, no. It's not. You wouldn't accept anyone you care about being treated the way the Palestinians are by their colonisers. Zionists, like all racist ideologies, decided at some point that the people they don't care about personally aren't worth that same level of consideration. Not everyone thinks like that. A person can't walk out of the woods in a day if she spent days walking into them. This woman was raised and indoctrinated to believe sanctifying and polarising lies about what the state of Israel is, what it represents, and that no amount of violence goes too far in its maintenance and expansion. She trusted her conscience, educated herself, and now she is an antizionist. She's saved her spot on the right side of history. Because the truth is a one-way street on this issue. Learning and understanding the lived reality of Palestinians, and the unvarnished truth of the orgy of violence that preceded Israel's founding as a state (what Palestinians call the nakba, which translates to ' the catastrophe') along with the daily depravity committed to sustain Israeli apartheid, this can only lead a decent human being to antizionism. The only way to become a zionist is to be indoctrinated (from a young age or by propaganda) or be so selfishly cynical as to be willing to lie to yourself and others because, at least for now, that's still where the power is. It's still where the bread is buttered. But not forever.I don't mean to patronise or talk down to you. But if you feel there is more to the Palestinian cause - and its historical case - that you can learn, and you would like to, I can share some links and resources with you here.

I never cease to be amazed by the Iron Dome.
Its not stolen if you think God gave it to you.
IDK why he is getting down voted as the poster has a point. At what point is the iron dome unsustainable from the supply side and Israel has to go after the launch locations, ammunition depots, and production sources outside of the current area of conflict.  If this war persists that may be sooner than many think...
This has been going on for decades and no one can criticize Israelis without being called an anti-Semite.  Really sad state of affairs.
It‚Äôs a genocide
This is entirely true, but only if you don‚Äôt understand what the UN does, what Israel is doing, and what war crimes are.
"Why isn't there discussion about what the IDF has done?"Because we're currently being disgusted by what Hamas has done and will continue to do if they aren't receiving the appropriate consequences for their actions.
I am wonder if they are just trying to deplete the iron dome's ordinance and then the rest of the Iranian backed groups join in from the north...
"It's my Birthright"
I was hoping for the Benny Hill music.
They won't care, most people will justify it, others will say it's false and a few will cheer it even
Maybe yes, maybe not.  There are a lot of unknowns.  I don't think the IDF really know the true strength of Hamas or their defenses.  They could have 30,000 well-trained, supplied and rested troops just waiting to spring a ton of traps from their underground lairs.  But they also may have only a few hundred (and the rest are scattered and disorganized) down there and the IDF can smoke them out of the underground.  They are proceeding cautiously, with good reason...
&gt; Israel gets made to look like fools, and they're so entitled they decide the rules of war don't even apply to them.They don't look like fools - governments have one job: protect their citizens. Most countries would have gone harder, faster and more aggressively. They sure as hell wouldn't have warned them to distance themselves from Hamas terrorists weeks in advance. Dance with the devil you're going to get burned.Only people who look like fools are the ones claiming that Israel shouldn't respond to mass murder or seek to finish off Hamas once and for all.
They could always use the tried and true Self-Destruct if it comes down to it
Isreal handing out the kinetic delete option. Don't be shy, hamas, Isreal has plenty for everyone.
You don't understand, we're so oppressed! Their kids throw rocks at our tanks, it's only fair!
Genuine question, who is the guy recording this?
Only 1 made it through? Jesus Christ that's insane
The smugness is palpable. Pathetic how people so absolutely disconnected from this conflict behave like it's sports. Social media is ruining us.
r/TIFU
buddy just said he was pro israel and switched teams mid game when presented fax lol
Thank you for the translation ‚ô°
That basically sums up the whole Palestine-Israel conflict. Where one side has an advanced army and if you dare to criticise them for what they are doing you are called an anti-semite.
No. That‚Äôs being done because they abducted 200 hostages.  Did you miss that part?
Kick some ass Israel
If they had like 20 more guys they could catch him
I'd run like hell too.
***MAY YOUR LEMONADES ALWAYS BE SOUR AND YOUR SHOE LACES FOREVER COME UNDONE!***
Real question, why weren‚Äôt the Jews already there? This is their homeland as well. What happened before the past 75 years and who was the aggressor that we got to a place where the Jews were no longer in what is now Israel?None of this is right and I‚Äôm definitely not advocating for genocide, but this conflict goes back thousands of years. Both sides have been greatly wronged. I know it doesn‚Äôt excuse what Israel is doing right now.
The guy recording said it was a whole family in that car, if true thats just sad, thats why he started screaming at the end shouting "Go back" to people on the road.
Grozny was the Chechen capital so......
Wasn't their obsidian block destroyed before and they just rebuilt it?Sure they would see it as a slap in the face but it's just the foundation for a nether portal in the end.
Apartheid much?

There was clearly a hamas fighter in the trunk using the driver as a human shield /s
Awolnation - Run
It was a whole family in that car based on the commentary, i love reading people's comments justifying this, just hilarious to read really
Well if we are speaking on terms of international law? Yes.  The obligation to remove civilians from a combat zone is on both factions.  The IDF is legally required to allow time for civilians to evacuate, which they did. Giving over 2 weeks of notice for civilians to withdraw from Northern Gaza so they can conduct retaliatory strikes against Hamas. Now it‚Äôs well known that Hamas has deterred such evacuations and use civilian buildings and infrastructure for their own military operations, violating the Laws of War and in doing so, making these civilian targets into legitimate targets for the IDF to target. It‚Äôs tragic that many innocent civilians will die, but it‚Äôs inevitable in the dirty reality of urbanized warfare.  Israel is now mandated by its own people to conduct a massive land campaign into Gaza after losing over 1000 civilians overnight to border raids.  There is no other acceptable solution to such an act.  Ultimately Hamas is the direct cause the excessive loss of life.  They openly brag about how they seize humanitarian aid and use it to feed their soldiers, they recorded videos of them digging up water pipelines supplied to the Palestinian people by the UN and convert them into missiles to be launched at civilian settlements.  They establish their military caches and operation centers under schools and hospitals.  They radicalize the youth in schools where they focus teaching on the agenda of Hamas.The world is not a clean place, and never will be.  Sometimes the solution is in reality, violence.  Violence is the ultimate decider in human history and there is no reason to think that we can change it just because we have fancier technology.
People do this because they keep getting away with it. Where are the consequences?
[Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zvi_Yehezkeli) article on Zvi Yehezkeli
what do you propose they do?
The echo chamber exists because one side is literal terrorists who massacred hundreds of civilians, including over 200 people at a music festival and then parades corpses through the streets of this very city to the cheering of thousands of people. These same people now cry out for a ceasefire and for the world to see their plight, but the mask is off and their hatred has been seen and has disgusted many in the west.  Perhaps if the Israelis weren‚Äôt fighting tunnel rats and cowards who hide behind civilians these people on Reddit might have some sympathy for a people who wish nothing but the total slaughter of Jews worldwide.
You do realize that Israel continues to expand illegally through settlements, right? You've been lied to.
What a dumb fucking comment. Like just a truly, truly, stupid thing to say. Even if you want to ignore the human lives being saved, you know, the important part, and look only at economics, the amount of infrastructure that‚Äôs being saved by the Iron Dome far exceeds the cost of the defence system. Like what are you even trying to suggest? Israel just let‚Äôs all of these rockets land to save on costs?
But I put my matress in here, so now it's mine.
Revisionist is government and media propaganda, Isreal and the West.
You should be
Seriously? That actually sounds pretty cool.
By Allah, you people are dogs. I will continue as usual
It makes more sense if the rockets coming from the right are "Iron Dome"!
in an interview with the guy recording this, he says they shot at a bus with civilians right after this video.
Now you‚Äôre starting to get it
this needs to go up higher for the zionists to see.
Does that count Pringles as well
Hey, I'm taking 50 percent ownership of your house and you should accept my split owner ship proposal

Israel are committing genocide that's what's happening.

This is the line of thinking that the average middle-manager has. "Oh no, we have COSTS? Let's get rid of them immediately!", claps themselves on the back, job done.Then it turns out that the knowledge/security the company lost has cost  tens if not hundreds of times more.So they spent around $2,400,000 on these intercepts, sure. But they saved hundreds of millions on saved infrastructure and lives.
It is per International law and any stretch of logic. When you control all the borders, movement in and out what goes in and out that is an occupation. As for Egypt even recent events show how Israel ultimately controls the  crossing that it can close and bomb at will. Come up with something that isn't so obviously not true. "Making stuff up" lol
Clearly a Hamas tank, only Hamas would murder civilians /s.
What's the rifle at minute 0:08? Looks damn sexy.
**U DON GOOFED.**
Doesn‚Äôt look very shot down to me
Revisionist history is not history.
im usually on the lets wait for evidence crew, but my man, you are coping extremely hard
lockmart r &amp; d
OP said it was not north of the line IDF said to evacuate from, but the coordinates puts it north of Wadi Gaza
Did you not see the hamas battalion standing behind the car...what choice did that tank have
Gaza isn't occupied since September 2005 and from that time until June 2007 there was no blocked, the blockade only started after hamas took power and started to shot rockets. Also, gaza has a border with Egypt, but you blame only israel, wonder why that is.If you're going to make shit up atlist make a bit harder to disprove
Translation:-‚ÄúLook at that, take a pic take a pic,may god protect‚Äù-‚Äúhe‚Äôs a goner‚Äù-‚Äúhe‚Äôs turning back‚Äù-*tank shoots at car*-‚Äúthey hit him, there‚Äôs no no strength or power greater than god (X4)‚Äù-‚Äúhe‚Äôs gone, he‚Äôs gone‚Äù-‚Äúthat was a whole family‚Äù-‚ÄúGET BACK,GET BACK,GET BAAAACK‚Äù(at other cars going down the same road)This is very sad
It‚Äôs more like if your mother partnered with the kidnappers and agreed to be taken hostage.Hamas is a terror organization but it is vastly supported within Gaza and acts like the government.You need to understand Hamas terrorists are Gaza civilians. I‚Äôm not saying all Gaza citizens are terrorists but all Hamas terrorists are indeed Gaza citizens
Hmmmm...So Israel should be held to same moral standards as a terror group? Real mask off moment right there bud.
Not necessarily... just new accounts. Bot-spam from both sides would be removed.
It's mentally useful having a scape goat to blame for all of ones problems... it's like when trump fans blame latinos and blacks for all they don't like in the world.
Not even close to comparable, look at what the Americans did when a couple planes were used as missiles to target civilians... Hamas has fired tens of thousands of missiles at civilian targets in Isreal from the shadows of civilian Infustrucure,  they also just brutally crossed the border and slaughtered hundreds with their  hands ..America would of leved gaza along time ago , for alot less if it was in Israel's shoes, most any other country would of too .
Imagine if your house was destroyed by a rocket and you asked the govt people why didn't they shot it down and they would answer that a single anti rocket missile is more expensive than your house and it was economically unviable to protect people's houses with such weapons. What would you think about that?
Stop condemning Israel. That's clearly another human shield /s
Funny how they're peacekeeping their way through so many dead civilians. Israel gets made to look like fools, and they're so entitled they decide the rules of war don't even apply to them.This echo chamber on certain subs leads me to believe the powers that be, have a large stake in this, and attempt to stifle any conversation that even suggests that Israel may be taking their rampant destruction too far.Its only terrorism one way?
Did you even watch the video? We've seen plenty of Naval drones and non of them look like that when they get destroyed. Also how TF could they get them into the bay? That would be a huge blunder from Russia.
Israeli citizen die because the Israel government runs the world largest concentration camp and runs a brutal occupation and apartheid regime. You are frothing in the mouth because of the ghetto uprising but it's inevitable consequence of Israel state policy. It will keep happening and endager Israeli lives for no reason whatsoever.The problem with your logic also is Israel is an occupying power. Palestinian civilians are it's responsibility too per International law. Sorry, we aren't living in Old testament times. There is no collective punishment that can be meted out. The Human shields arguments are bunk, HAMAS &amp; other militant factions could easily apply them in the other direction and they have the lopsided civilian death toll to support it.I mean the solution are obvious. Ending occupation and allowing formation of a Palestinian state would free Israel of all these responsibilities as an occupying power. Then it can respond the way it's doing to provocations like Oct 8th.
What are they doing in tbe west Bank there is no hamas here ?
&gt;I'm generally uncomfortable with countries that don't have at least our standard of rules of engagement.Your comfort level has been noted.
Disgusting.
What's a bulldozer doing in the wast bank I thought it was hamas who israel were fighting ? There is no hamas in the west Bank?
Most moral army
The gps coordinates in the tweet you linked say it was where the person you responded to said it was, south of Gaza City.
The last two weeks have illustrated the hypocrisy of so many people that claim they care about human rights. It‚Äôs been eye opening and really disheartening. It really is about race for a lot of folks and I genuinely thought we were better than that.
Exactly, this conflict is not just political and violent over border arrangement. It goes waaaay deeper.

Reposting my comment from another subThese were civilians. The person in the video is interviewed in full here. https://twitter.com/EekadFacts/status/1718934904715513909The video is taken by journalists covering gaza, hence the cameras. **Translation:**Witness: We were surprised and the car was surprised of the presence of a tank &amp; bulldozer on Salah El Din street. The tank targeted the car directly. In front of our eyes, they targeted all of them.Interviewer: Who was in the car, did you get a look at the passengers? were they civilians?Witness: Yes, I saw them with my own eyes, they were civilians. An old guy, white haired, I saw him slip past me, he was the driver and behind him were children &amp; women. They reached the tank and the old guy was surprised by it, he hit the brakes and turned around to go back and was hit.2nd interviewer: Question then, were the cars you were warning, did they turn around? Witness: Yes, all but 2, there was a bus, he didnt hear us, and went ahead, he was also targeted. a bus filled with civilians. They are showing how they will be treating civilians. Dont dismiss these warcrimes
The idf shoot kids throwing rocks at them. They don't care whether something is dangerous. They exert their military dominance given right to insert themselves into a region full of people that hate them, then shoot at them when they throw rocks. Because rocks are so threatening to one of the most advanced militaries in the world.
They shot down shit
Cruise missiles fly way lower than that.
Somebody needs to get the Amish under control.
Yeah keep in mind this video is hella old.But I guess it‚Äôs good to see some of the fuckery going on around those parts. That shit is not cool at all.A lot of this situation is complex, but these actions are not complex they are clearly just vile
These guys are not tik tok warriors, they don't release this footage so little Jimmy can watch it on reddit this is proper military censorship. If it was the US releasing it would be just as heavily degraded.
Fair point. I would change the title if I could, but i wouldn't delete the post over it. Drawing attention to it is worthwhile nonetheless.
95% of people who actually took courses and read books about the conflict are with Palestine (not Hamas). The rest are psychopaths who have deep hatred for the Arabs and Muslims and get high on watching them die.
In the past three weeks Isreal has killed around 3400 children.... More dead kids than all wars combined since 2019.  This is according to Save the children.    The Israeli government is not better than Hamas by any measure, they fucking deserve each other but these kids don't.   This shit is beyond sick we should be disarming and breaking down both sides, but we'll just keep over-arming the colonizers as usual.
They could probably claim it was a VBIED, but the fact that they turn around and there was a relatively small detonation it‚Äôs probably untrue.
And you say that based on what evidence from which credible source?
Not to mention the productivity a person can produce over his/her life time will most likely more than make up for the difference
So many stones being thrown and not 1 being put inside those tracks? üòÖ
Fallujah style ROE seem to be in force.
Getting radicalized in the best way
Did they shoot it down with the ground or by a heroic interception by an AA system (not a rocket but the system itself)?
8 storm shadows? For supplies?
I will never not be impressed by this kind of hack
Toyota hajah caught me off guard ngl
No, you see, everyone still in Gaza is clearly Hamas, those babies are just future Hamas fighters. Checkmate UNObvious /s
No, no. I fully support Palestinians. This is tragic.
Damn I thought they were one of the non hasbara run subs. I'll try posting it there and see how it goes
Lets hope when Israel finishes this business, she gives some of these goodies to Ukraine to return the favour to Russia's support of arab terrorists.
Probably just their supplies coming in at this point.
Not sure you read that correctly. I just called IDF genocidal.
Either a naval drone or interception
Because there are dagestani jews
HAMSEAL?
I was banned from there for a month appearently only pro Israel is allowed there
Is that why they beefed up their air defense? To defend nothing?
Wait for IDF to say it was Hamas in 3 -2-1...
Now *that‚Äôs* a fucking bulldozer üí™üèª
Also why are there a lot of deleted comments?
Black smoke spotted in Sevastopol bay, picture already online. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=crKjOpeKHbE
Damn it was trying to leave and they just blew it up. That‚Äôs fucked up. Like I doubt they were trying to do anything to the tank. What can a car do unless it had explosives in it but after that shot it didn‚Äôt seem like it did. So I‚Äôm guessing it was normal people in that car trying to leave and got blown up. RIP

This is a little concerning. Iraq was a horrible move, but at least there was a standing army. Everything here is getting labeled as a Hamas hideout.Dropping more bombs in ten days than we did in a year in Afghanistan doesn't strike me as being selective. I'm generally uncomfortable with countries that don't have at least our standard of rules of engagement. I am not sure if Israel meets those or even prosecutes infractions.
Definitely not S300/S400 they go straight up, ballistic and the interception/self destruct being too close to the launch, definitely some SHORAD.
Scum Bastards.
With that video quality from the security cameras, he should have tried stealing a tank, or a plane.  /s
"My ancestors took this land over 500 years ago, and this is how they did it"
It looks like the tank was hidden behind the building and firing at anything moving in either direction. I wonder how many civilian vehicles they shot that weren‚Äôt captured on camera.
Might be ADM-160s flying at their optimal altitude, no warhead for a big boom.
Ukraine flashbacks.

I didnt know a car was more dangerous than an IDF tank. I'm glad to know you support the murder of civilians. I bet you weren't singing the same song a few weeks back huh. Damn religious hypocrits are disgusting bunch. I spit on you.
I'm all for "Bayonet-Fighterjets" for infantry support, but just to be a bit extra cautious, we should keep it away from British infantry.
I remember a dog being in there as well and the audio was horrible to listen to. I feel bad for the civilians in this conflict, both sides have done wrong to each other but it‚Äôs the civilians that are suffering the most in this war. Innocent people being killed no matter what nationality is terrible, no one will sway my mind on this, I care for both the Israeli and Palestinian civilians in this war as well as the hostages.Edit: dumb TBI made me screw the wording of my sentence up.
People are guilt tripped when they say it out loud and are accused of anti semitism, but only a religious code or belief system would subdue your consciousness like that. If you are born and raised into such entitlement because your ancestors from the iron age lived in that place then you can wonder no more.
What? In the name of Islam? Stop making Islam look bad‚Ä¶
IDF killed their own people during okt. 7th. So idk what picture you are trying to paint
They seem to make attempts. Conducting warfare in a population center is always going to not be pretty. How else would you do it?
I genuinely can‚Äôt put myself into the mindset of someone who has just blatantly stolen someone‚Äôs home, and moved in.Seemingly, without guilt, without shame, without remorse. ‚ÄúI wanted it, so I took it.‚ÄùAnd the owner? Homeless, now. A lifetime of memories. Can they even claim their own possessions? The framed pictures of relatives? Their own clothes?  This is madness.
He‚Äôs a vile human.
They moved much of their navy and all submarines further south.
This.I was not surprised when I read that most of the members of Hamas were orphaned by Israels prior attacks.
Just a submarine a couple officers I think last time.
Like Israel cares about collateral damage
ADM-160 missiles are relatively cheap. $120k a missile, less than each S-400 missile fired at it.
Fuck Hamas and Fuck Israel
The car was clearly backing away. I wanna see the ‚Äú israel do not target civilians people‚Äù
Thanks for the idea, working on it now.
I bet hamas wished they had an iron dome about now but they‚Äôre raggedy asses get domed instead.
By speed and size of the interceptors I'm guessing Pantsir? Would indicate drones being intercepted rather than stormshadows methinks.
Top score too you, So true, I hope this reaches many people to help them understand.
Boy you dumb lol
And that's how your partner gets to sneak into their base
Not what I‚Äôm saying at all is it. Notice how Israel‚Äôs biggest backers are all frequently ‚Äòpeeved‚Äô with Israel due to its illegal settlement policies.What isn‚Äôt okay is Muslim fundamentalists singling it out due to the fact it‚Äôs Jewish. What Israel is doing with settlers is nothing compared to the genocide of Muslims in China for example. How many times has this been condemned?
If Hamas is destroyed, another terrorist organization will simply take its place in less than five years. I know we all wanna live in a fantasy world were killing the "bad guys" fixes everything but this is real life, not some shitty feel good action film. There will never be peace in the Middle East.
Old picture, and funny enough was used as an example by someone to show how they verify their sources and make sure not to post false info:  https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1718801143411736674
Palestinians don't have a country yet??? Please explain how you came to this conclusion??
I thought storm shadow hugged ground to avoid being detected until last moments. Also why would Ukraine launch all via same route when they could have them on different routes in to the target. Seem to be travelling a lot faster than SS too.
Dagestan has a right to defend itself
Thank you for the chuckle, amongst a very serious topic.
Property values in the Golan Heights have probably dipped recently. Great time to buy!
No, I didn't after 3 watches. But then I read this, ty hero!
Might cause too much in the way of collateral damage  to hit the rocket systems on ground. A lot of them are in very close proximity to civilian occupied buildings. I know there is a lot of collateral from JDAMs as well but this would be a much higher yield due to all the secondary explosions.
ADM-160 is not a "cruise missile" it is a small missile that looks bigger to Radar than it is. It has no warhead and it's only job is to soak up enemy air defence resources and/or interceptors time. It is only 2.8m long, whilst storm shadow is 5.1m and has a sizeable warhead.Ergo the  observation you make about the lack of large impact from the intercept suggests Russia shot down the decoys.
Arming radical religious groups has never gone badly ever, always the best move.
Realizing my title has worse redundancy than ATM machine  :/

"Won't anybody think of all the money this costs?"...Said nobody ever while saving lives.
Extremely underrated comment.
Fantastic self defence, Israel. You're successfully gaining a momentum of hatred from around the world directed at yourselves. What the fuck is your end goal here, exactly?
These comments are like people justifying the holocaust. Kids are dying daily, along with their families and those around them. I'm thankful that my kids have warm beds at night and horrified by the desensitised nature of people today. Ceasefire is needed.
How exactly will they flood into Gaza? How will Russian aid get in? It's blockaded by both Israel and Egypt. In any event, Israel is easily capable of handling Hamas on its own, the US will only get drawn in if Hezbollah intervenes and that will be limited to the armada in the Mediterranean supporting the IDF in attacking Hezbollah. Though it looks like Hezbollah isn't going to do it.
https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/s/KoD7JiRd48Totally unintentional.
Lmao, using a 4chan post (totally no anti-Semitism there) as evidence.
Wrong.Isreal created the Arab governments including the so called Palestinian government including Arafat, all Arab governments are part of the big occupation plan, they had them in power before the 1947 invasion of Palestine even began, they created many fake resistance groupes like AlQeada/ISIS and many others in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan and Palestine, Hamas and Qassam are not one of them and if you find anything suspicious as if Israel wanted to use this as an exuse to mass murder people then yeah, Israel mass murderd people long before there was Hamas and yes Israel did know that the resistance breached their territory and didn't act on it (their Egyptian buddies notified them that their air has been breached btw), they allowed it but that doesn't mean Hamas was on it, add to that the IDF shooting Israelies (because they're such cowards as usual and began to shoot on anything that moves) not to mention faking news by making up lies from nothing and using AI images and even using images of violence from other countries.The freed Israeli prisoners of war had only good things to say about Hamas. Hamas is hated by all Arab governments and western because they are freedom fighters fighting the terrorist occupation.And all Arab governments are Zionists, they are western Zionist puppets, if we had real Muslim leaders the Zionists would have been kicked out the same year they attacked.Hamas is a direct threat to the Nazi apartheid state of Israel and a direct threat to their Arab Zionist leaders, they don't want resistance, they want sheep that doesn't move while getting slaughtered.And it's only natural that where there is oppression there is resistance.They really are trying very hard to smear Hamas's image, that's one of the things they do when it comes to something that threatens their aganda and plans.
Armored ‚Äúconstruction‚Äù equipment. :/
Vile people
Go ahead and justify your genocideFKN ANIMALS
Fuck Hamas!
The simplest is to wait for a high amplitude on a specific wavelength. A more complicated way is to use a specific signal, like the one used by remote controls, for a TV for example. You can actually use the remote and the receiver boards, just switch the only and output for a piece of radio. And so you could hit on/off button and send a radio signal that would then be received by the receiver through radio.
&gt;Missiles are pretty cheapIMHO it's not about the price, it's more about the quantity we get. So we just need to pick targets more carefully and plan strikes thoroughly to not waste those limited amounts. And that's why it makes me sad to see that one rocket got intercepted on this video
No one minds jews.It's the Israeli government and those who support this genocide people have an issue with
Wait, wait, wait...and Russia TECHNICALLY isn't the successor of the USSR...Kazakhstan is...HMMM
Terrible taste, but I admire your boldness.
For just $5 we can get this video more pixels
They just dont get it
I mostly agree, but the NATO veto on new members does make sence. Otherwise you could be stuck having to come to the aid of a country you despise.cough *turkey* cough *greece*
Yep, car driving towards the passing armored column. Stopping in reasonable distance and getting multiple HE rounds from Russia APC to windshield, killing older couple.It was disgusting, and it's dumbfounding  seeing the same "NAFO" profiles on Twitter who called it a war crime before, calling this a "Good Job" or "Well it's their fault being on the road".
I'll assume you are talking to the other guy, because what you just said, is basically exactly what i said
Just imagine Hamas' disappointment when they really wanted to kill random civilians. Serves them right.

&gt; Instead of blaming them for what they earned, their enemies should be looking inward at their values trying to mimic success. But ofc that's not how the world works...Yes, that's the point. Hitler didn't create the hate against Jews, he simply used it and strengthened it. And coincidentally it also happened to be a very rich group of people whose assets were all seized to support the state and then the world war.
They didn't what? Did they not agree to the UN partition plan while Arab states did not then years later like 5 countries attacked Israel. Israel has agreed to 2 state solutions saying they haven't is lies.
And what imagine do you think fighters have?
I'm saying that if it really is cruise missiles then you aren't seeing any large impacts on the ground in what is a large city.

What are you saying? The decoy missiles are still real flying objects.
Wow a lot of ‚Äúdeleted‚Äù someone is not working and playing well with others
Where is that 200 kidnapped Israeli number coming from?
Which is exactly why they armed all the countries surrounding them that invaded them previously?
Missiles are not cheap, some drones are.
You should post this on public freakout too
The price of the rocket doesn't matter. The correct comparison is to use the cost of the damages. Even if it doesn't kill anyone, just injuring a person or damaging a building or any infrastructure would EASILY cost 100.000 or more.
Youre watching with your own eyes someone trying to run away and being shot with not a gun, but a tank in the back. That is some of the most unhuman shit I've ever seen. Cease fire. Give Palestinians freedom.
Without any impacts there is a good chance it is not
There's already been a couple hundred casualties Blue Helmet from deliberate fire from Isarel, Hezbollah and Palestinians. They're pretty much considered as nuisance and shot like such.
Missiles are pretty cheap. Might just lob some at them to see the reaction. Anyway all we see here is some missiles flying around.
So much misunderstanding going on. Alexa nor Google nor any other home assistant, are not artificial intelligence. They don't even use neural networks.ChatGPT is only one of tens of thousands of text-to-text models, and is heavily censored at that. This is straight up the misuse of the technology and immediately labeling everything AI as 'bad'.
It kept tanks out of Gaza until now. But yeah I guess you‚Äôre right. Time to roll in and solve the problem.
I feel like we are living a Black Mirror existence. Nothing seems real, true, or decent anymore. It‚Äôs so hellish.

The math is easy. RF fired 8 missiles with a known kill rate of 100%, so the 8 missiles hit 8 Storm Shadows. You can see the trails of the missiles, you can hear them go "Bang!"... go figure.Who would doubt that, it's clear as daylight. We don't need to see debris, we don't needd to see the Storm Shadows, now do we?
there are neonazi groups everywhere around the world ur whataboutism is shitty
I live in Harlem. There used to be a group of em on 125th st that would have a whole set up and they would stand on their little podium and just spout bullshit, and some people actually believed them. Insane times we're living in.
Storm Shadows fly at much lower altitude than anything in this video and the terminal pop up is incredibly quick. No idea what is being intercepted here if anything. No wreckage to be seen.
bro u just dumb
‚Ä¶ so where is the mighty hamas? The ones who were so proud of invading and killing civilians‚Ä¶ curios ‚Ä¶
&gt; with minimal casualties.   Yes, 3 day operation...
So you deny that Israel killed them? Why not focus on refuting that instead of just throwing sand in the air?

If you find a russian troll in the comments just send them a bunch of extraordinary graphic videos of russian soldiers getting liquidated in Ukraine, it makes them quite angry
You so blatantly say I support Hamas. Stop waffling and give me evidence u nut crack. If you think this is just the start of Israel's torture you are clearly blinded by propoganda. Whenever in history genocide was committed people like you blindly supported it.
You do know there are decoy missiles launched with storm shadows don't you?Back in May there is video of Ukraine using ADM-160.There is a good chance that is what is being intercepted by Russia.
there is something called ground penetrating radar, but it's not useful here. Likewise there is some other tech that could detect earth movements (netherlands for example uses it to map salinity in ground water), but again not feasible to conduct. in the end, a tunnel is build beneath a house which makes it impossible to penetrate with any of these methods
Just disgusting plain and simple. I wish Newsom would run. Cause ain‚Äôt no way I‚Äôd vote for any republican candidate but Biden is kissing me off acting like he don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs really going on.
The main reason for losing a entire team to one lucky granade may be the low-iq "tactical cuddling" in idle-positions?
Probably dropped it hoping they would stop chasing him if he gave it back? Doesn‚Äôt seem like it worked. Lacks context though so that‚Äôs just a complete guess.
Give it a minute and you'll see, the Russian Air Defence claim to clear all threats every single time. Then they lose 21 helicopters
Wonder how many kids they blew to pieces with this shot
Kind of surprised they still have platforms for the attacks especially with Argus drones being a thing and such a relatively small area to monitor.
Because this is false propaganda that the content creators created to try to get monetized.  It‚Äôs shameful.
You can literally see an intercept in this video.Cruise missiles are far from invincible, which is why Ukraine really wants more ballistic missiles like ATACMs.
who are these guys ?
Proof is always important
I'm not seeing anything
But, there is already video of something burning somewhere in Sevastopol seaport and somewhere near an airfield in Crimea.
Whatever Russia says, just flip it 180 degrees. Question for you. Do you get paid in worthless rubles or do they manage to pay you in a currency that's worth something?
I wish there'd been as many pixels in the video as there were people chasing the thief
Do you have a source ? Multiple have geo confirmed it to be north of the linehttps://x.com/il_kanguru/status/1718913929890455951?s=20Edit: To clarify. I am saying it is north of the evacuation line that IDF gave.
I know there is the meme of "We are lucky they are so fucking stupid" but did Ukraine seriously think Russia would not have beefed up  Sevastopol after the Black Sea HQ attack?This is a case of underestimation turning into complacency.
Sir, this is r/NonCredibleDefense, not r/MostCredibleDefense
Nah. The Arabian Empire will collapse. Demand for petroleum is going down as the world transitions to green energy. Peak Oil is predicted to take place around 2040. That is the reason for the Saudi Aramco IPO. Peak Oil might take down the Petroleum Dollar with it and loosens United States‚Äô grip on the world economy. But the impact on the Middle East is going to be far greater. Let‚Äôs also not forget what happened to the Jewish populations in these Islamic countries. There are none. They are expelled, killed, or forced to convert to Muslim.
You're going to have a bad time if you drive fast up to a tank.
I'm fully informed, but you seem like you can't read.I've addressed the settlers terror acts, and not settlements, those are almost 2 completely unrelated topics.
There‚Äôs a guy on the left who has some kind of object with a small light on it that looks like a homemade bomb with a fuse.
they are currently getting rid of the problem‚Äôs source
"Excuse me!..."
I dont know why youre getting downvoted . This person could be a cashier at the university shop, an accountant, an admin assistant; the possibilities are endless. The campus is massive.
The IDF estimate that there are 500 KM's of reinforced concrete tunnels below.If they are now cutting gaza in half, it makes me suspect that they believe they have collapsed the tunnels in half and trying to trap hamas fighters in the north.
I am not saying everything is fake. But some are. Just look at the blood. It is not so bright usually. It becomes brown in contact with air. So either the blood on the kids face is just there  since a few moments. Or it's just theatre blood. That's how it looks like to me.
All other news outlets state it damaged a building, nothing was destroyed.
Pure fear
Reddit ain't dead. It's a good and effective propaganda outlet still.
You know there's shortage of electricity, communications, and tv in Gaza right now? People have to eat and get water, go to the hospitals, help their relatives. We criticized Russia in Bucha and initial incursion for the casualities. We have to do it here too.Do you think people without electricity and network have the means to stay connected 24/7 on latest reddit videos? On official accounts the IDF still hasn't entered that far in Gaza with mechanized vehicles, because they just anounced they would start the incursion.
At least we can rest easy with the odds being the operators of that tank are long gone.
Looks like the tank would have been behind that building from the angle of driving down the street. Its possible they didnt see the tank until it was too late, and they attempted to turn around.
It‚Äôs crazy to me they don‚Äôt have drones flying over head 247 365 running some AI that can see rocket launches being prepared so that a f16 or eagle or HIMARS can be used to destroy said launch prior to ignition
‚ÄúPro-kicking the western settlers out of Israel‚Äù why don‚Äôt you say what you really mean - kill the infidels? The reality is that, right or wrong, two states currently exist and will continue to exist under current geopolitical conditions and there has been zero acceptance of that reality from the religious fanatics running Palestine
This one‚Äôs rough
Just what I was wondering.  Gotta get your ad placement.
&gt;front vehicle couldve been the same type of vehicle as the video recorder, innocent livesBoth vehicles could be innocent or neither of them could be. That is a huge problem with fighting terrorists. They don't fight in uniform. They don't play by the rules of war. They have a tendency to drive up to opposing forces in civilian vehicles and blow themselves up. At least many Russians at least paint a big stupid Z on the vehicles they drive.
When did Israel develop the hyperspectral tech? Wonder why this tech wasn't used before to expose the tunnels? Couldn't drone lidar help to detect this as well?
"it's driving away""oh definitely permission granted lol"
yer its fuggin gross&amp;#x200B;i dont get it &amp;#x200B;i think i need to turn my computer off and touch grass
doesnt look very good from the Israeli side :|Fleeing civilian car being fire upon
They still do.
Was Hamas hiding under that car?
This is disgusting.
Takes time to get permission to fire on a suspected target. You see it all the time in slow-rolling urban combat footage: \- "I see something suspicious, permission to fire?"\- "Does it pose a threat? Are there civilians?"and so on...
I'm sometimes reminded people living comfortably don't have the slightest idea of what's the meaning of real struggle.I equate this with Paris Hilton's "STOP BEING POOR" tshirt.
i hate this&amp;#x200B;so sad every ones angry&amp;#x200B;we are all puppets
Needs the Benny Hill theme playing
Perhaps they didnt think a tank would obliterate them, if they were a civilian inside a civilian vehicle..
No Benny Hill music?
Repost for the 100th time
This needed to happen before the ceasefire. Tunnels have been there for centuries.
Is it automatically antisemitic to be peeved at Israel? Could there not be legitimate reasons to have issues with them? Perhaps?
&lt;&lt;Is that a Paraglider. I know I shouldn't. But it looks so submissive... Fox 3.&gt;&gt;
Hmmm high def camera watching an overloaded car drive towards a tank? Seems suspicious to me.
Iran can take them. Since they‚Äôre so concerned about it.
The death of innocent civilians in Gaza *is* a war crime, and that crime is being committed by Hamas not Israel. The use of human shields is in itself categorized as a specific intent war crime under the Geneva Convention and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
Dagestan is a deranged region .
"searching for a flight from tel Aviv" is such an understatement of what they were doing my God. You misleading twat tell the people what they really wanted to do and why it was lynching Jews.
This one is especially fucked because Bella Hadid is Palestinian, she and her sister Gigi have been incredibly outspoken about Palestinian freedom, to the point the Israeli state social media accounts have been harassing the girls with AI images of "dead" Israeli children.
The difference with Ukraine is that Israel explicitly told all civilians to evacuate for 3 weeks now and said anyone who remains will be treated as a potential hostile.Ukrainian civilans were not given that option when Russia invaded.
Israel has to stop shooting and let HAMAS kill another few thousand Israeli civilians.
Unfortunately I‚Äôve never made a TikTok but maybe I will now
Well said..
How does it work then?   It's obviously not going to be reacting to "any" radio signal, but to a specific frequency and tone
There could be more we don't know. There could have been fire from the car beforehand or picking up fighters.Not saying this is the case but as with most things coming out we often don't get the whole context.
Looks like the tank was behind the building. When the car saw the tank, they tried taking a u-turn to go the opposite direction before being fired on just because.
Why would anyone drive that close to tanks?! IDF and Israel has told the civilians numerous times to evacuate from the areas. If I were driving that tank I would blow up a vehicle coming straight towards me aswell. People are crazy
Not not wildly irresponsible. CRIMINAL!
Lots of Muslims is just a blatant (hasbara) lie. This is very well known for everybody who doesn‚Äôt just believe anything the Israeli propaganda machine feeds them
Don't forget that the car could well be filled with combatants in full gear. If so then they probably turned around because shooting at a tank with AKs is not going to do shit.Could also be a family.We just don't know.
The northern part of Gaza will be surrounded
Was expecting Ride of the Valkyries to be dubbed over the chase.Was disappointed. üòû
There's literally no one safe in gaza. IDF says to head south, then they bomb the routes heading south and the south.
So, Jenin youth make it a sport of live broadcasting on tiktok. Every night you can find dozens of livestreams doing live broadcasts. If they see IDF they will follow them in droves. Seriously, set your location to the west bank and open tiktok live... it's every night until morning, you'll find them driving around in cars and motorcycles going around town looking for action.
Aren't you the same hypocrite who got caught supporting Hamas a few weeks ago? lmao
Maybe this car wasn't a threat maybe is had an RPG in the back and they were trying to turn to get a better angle. Who knows I'm just saying that the Israelis shooting first and asking questions later is more understandable because of the nature of hamas and because there shouldn't be any civilians present in these areas. I'm not saying that every casualty in this ground invasion is going to be Hamas, of course civilians will be caught in the crossfire, just like in most urban warfare but if you are a civilian and you have foolishly refused to evacuate and you decide to drive close to Israeli tanks then I don't think you can expect them to automatically assume peaceful intentions. Compare to Ukraine where the Russians have little excuse to shoot civilians because the context is the complete opposite.
Some of the comments here are wild. If that was a Russian tank blowing up a Ukrainian car the comments would be condemnatory.  But instead it's like "weeeeell they were told to leave, sooo..."Edit to address reply below as thread is locked: Hundreds of thousands of civilians have not evacuated,  so it's absolutely not a safe assumption that anyone driving a car is a terrorist.
What movie did you learn that jargon from lol?  It was a homemade grenade that if you look closely to the left some kid threw.You are literally saying it didn't blow up lol.Edit: I don‚Äôt know why you are all downvoting me lol. I thought it was funny. ‚ÄúThe failed detonation of the primary charge‚Äù means it didn‚Äôt blowup.  Literally means the detonator didn‚Äôt work(in a primary/secondary explosive the primary is the detonator to the secondary).For the sake of education the secondary charge is initiated by the primary charge(in the case where there are multiple forms of explosives). High explosives are secondary charges.  In this case it‚Äôs all primary. A primary explosive is a sensitive one, meaning a simple fuse or electrical charge etc will detonate it.  A blasting cap is an example of a primary explosive with the high explosive(c4 tnt Semtex etc) being the secondary. Don‚Äôt confuse primary with big or powerful, it‚Äôs called primary because it‚Äôs first in the chain of explosions. Regardless, if it was a multi stage bomb(it‚Äôs not it‚Äôs all primary) the primary clearly detonated as it went boom.  If it went big boom the secondary detonated.Little sensitive for ‚Äúcombat footage‚Äù.Like GI Joe said kids, knowing is half the battle.
I mean, if the bike was stolen, why did he just up and abandon his get away ride?
Homemade ammonium nitrate grenade thrown by the dude on the left side next to the building.
I mean sure maybe.All I‚Äôm saying was that was the slowest ‚Äúoh fuck I gotta turn around.‚ÄùI‚Äôd slam it in reverse and try to get to the right where it looks like there would be part of a building between me and the tank.Looks like that tank is slightly behind a building.
If the would've shot the vehicle when it was still approaching it would still be bad but a mistake could be understandable since it is an active warzone and VBEDs are probably feared a lot by the IDF.But they were clearly trying to go the other way.On the other hand we can't see shit. Maybe it was full of combatants with weapons visible...People really should be more careful of context on both sides. We don't know at all who was in that car, what they were planning on doing or what they did just before. Too little context.
Considering the cameramen have professional telephoto equipment, are consciously tracking the car, and seem to be very aware of the tank‚Äôs presence (angling at the intersection to make a quick getaway), this video has all the hallmarks of a Pallywood sympathy bait (‚Äúcivilians‚Äù in car) production or martyrdom suicide bombing video.
scary
Depends on what the hivemind decides
No, this sub is one of the most racist and bloodthirsty places on this site. The average poster has zero sympathy for murdered Palestinian civilians.
none of these people know what they are talking about, it was a homemade grenade and I doubt anyone would be cool with them throwing it right next to them. They are on the side of the building btw (dude who threw it). Some kid wanting to play jihad.
Hamas started this war knowing full well that many, many innocent civilians would die. The Palestinian people need to rise up against them and help the Israeli army weed out the terrorists that are behind this.
That's six tons of testosterone converging to a beat down....
Whack.  Those are not the only possibilities.
If the soldiers in the tank were intent on murdering civilians, it wouldn't make a difference if you reversed or attempted a 3-point turn. They would kill you and your family either way.
The Israeli government **created** hamas so that they would have an excuse not to deal with Arafat in good faith.
It‚Äôs not just an ideology. Anyone can have an ideology and start a cult. Hamas is first and foremost an *organization*. A very well funded and widely supported one at that, with a long history of implemented violent operations. Organizations can be stopped, suppressed, eradicated.
Religion is for cavemen
War criminal
If you want to shoot 4 rounds under 30 seconds, use a hand rammer.
And how do you know it was civilians?
What the f was the car doing?
[an example of a deepfake of a celebrity supporting Israel](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fauxmoi/s/WxpJTR7OS8)
It's genocide
Totally not anti semitic
That strike looks like it was just below the apogee of the missile's path. To me, it looks more likely to be from falling debris of an intercepted missile.
Do you think they have a map over all tank positions in the area? People are still trying to live there. They were turning around.
thank a different group of arabs for teaching me booms. Little ammonium nitrate(orange smoke/flash) grenade or pipe bomb, most likely grenade in some plastic bottle with nails and shit, wasn't loud or sharp enough for a pipe bomb.  No one is making a command-detonated IED like that. If they are savvy enough to build one they know how much charge they need and especially not to put them on the surface of paved road.EDIT: oh and if anyone else who was implying the guy driving knew reads this, I highly doubt that he would be cool with them throwing that as he drove by, but who knows. Doubtful though, he was probably just recording you know.... the Israeli convoy moving through his town.  Looked like kids wanting to play jihad.
Right? So fucking sad.
I mean the max of 5 civilians that were killed in that car are just 5 out of 6000+ Gaza inhabitants that were killed in the last 2 weeks, including UN personnel and foreign journalists.
*Launches rockets from mosques and schools*"Evil Jews targetting schools and mosques"
Or just shit suspension in a country that probably doesn't have the best road/vehicle infrastructure.
Who says there are civilians in this car? All Hamas terrorists drive a civilian car.
So much for they are only going after Hamas. This is why they don't want Palestinians to have contact with the outside world.
"Russia has been warning people to leave the area and go south for weeks now. For Russia it seems a fair assumption that anyone traveling to the north at this point is likely to be the enemy."Yeah, see how that reads when you do a little swap of names? This is yet another war crimes caught on camera.
This is exactly like the videos that came from Ukraine during the initial invasion.The video with the father and son and the elderly couple comes to mind‚Ä¶
Hard to beat US military support
That watermark logo though...what the hell is it? Golan Heights Realty.
looks like fireworks :-)
People who think Israel is going to "wipe out Hamas" cannot possibly have ever absorbed actual history in any meaningful way.Even recent history should tell us what will happen in the coming months.1. Israel will run into a serious problem if it attempts street-by-street fighting.2. Hamas will suffer significant losses but civilians will suffer more which will make for the best propaganda.3. People from all around the world will flood in to Palestine in order to join the latest holy war and survivors of the previous failed Islamic revolutions will return with all the lessons they learned.4. Russia will stoke these fires by assisting a new ISIS while pretending to act as peacemakers.5. The US will get further drawn into the conflict &amp; Ukraine will become background noise as we lose perspective on an actual modern war.
"Work smarter not harder" - second guy who picked up the bike
Whatever your stance on this is, were this a Russian tank firing on a civilian car there would be unanimous condemnation of it (and rightly so). This, sadly, is a war crime - objectively.
Kinks are genetically passed on
No I'm not biased, I'm being logical, let's say I was that said solider, I see the car turning around, going away from me, why shoot it? How is it a threat?
This fight will never be over, otherwise Israel wouldn‚Äôt be able to continue using palestine as a testing ground for it‚Äôs tools of oppression. If their weapons and spyware weren‚Äôt so thoroughly tested, and their power to keep people oppressed went undemonstrated, none of the worst dictatorships in the world would continue purchasing it.
But Putin didn't give Ukrainian civilians advanced warning to evacuate, in fact most of his troops didn't know about the invasion dates until the actual day. Ukrainian army doesn't operate in civilian clothing and it doesn't have a history of using SVBIEDs to attack targets. If you were a Israeli soldier and you are operating in an area that is meant to be devoid of civilians and suddenly a car starts driving close to you. What do you do, risk shooting a civilian or risk getting your crew killed because it was packed with explosives. I guess everything is bias when you ignore the nuance.
[And I gave you a rhetorical answer](https://youtu.be/hR32aPu_Bv0?si=1CiDmHF4J8pDDMGM)
To train more than 1500 people to commit the atrocities on 10/7/23, there has to be many people involved or with knowledge, what did they think was going to be the Israeli response
Yeah, yeah, but their mistake is that they are both brown and muslim, so it's on them really
Yeah the JIDF is out in force on this sub. The amount of extremely reaching comments in every thread about Hamas or Israel is just incredible. We could watch Israel execute a Palestinian child and the comments would be "well did you see the way the child was crying, threateningly? We just don't know the whole picture here."
Us falls?
The Hague hates this one simple trick.
Not to mention over a million civilian residents, many of them already twice or even thrice displaced.  This will be a humanitarian catastrophe (already is).
I wonder what HAMAS was expecting as a response
So that means all civilians are fair game because terrorists exist? Interesting take
Pretty based from us, if you want a ceasefire release the hostages.
Ha I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd go that far in saying that governments know better in weighing costs‚Ä¶ One could only hope that they hired the right people for the job.Historically and more recently, there‚Äôs been a bunch of conflicts in which we look back and think, ‚Äúthat was a waste‚Äù or ‚Äúthat was based on bad intel.‚Äù
Heights of cowardice to sit in your tank and blast away at civilians retreating. Disgusting war crime.
I feel so bad for the Uyghurs that the world has basically forgotten about
I can fuck them if I try hard enough
Actual bottom line:  None of this would have happened had Israel not created hamas and continued a decades long occupation and genocidal apartheid regime.https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/Listen to former Israeli officials such as Brig. Gen. Yitzhak Segev, who was the Israeli military governor in Gaza in the early 1980s. Segev later told a New York Times reporter that he had helped finance the Palestinian Islamist movement as a ‚Äúcounterweight‚Äù to the secularists and leftists of the Palestine Liberation Organization and the Fatah party, led by Yasser Arafat (who himself referred to Hamas as ‚Äúa creature of Israel.‚Äù)‚ÄúThe Israeli government gave me a budget,‚Äù the retired brigadier general confessed, ‚Äúand the military government gives to the mosques.‚Äù‚ÄúHamas, to my great regret, is Israel‚Äôs creation,‚Äù Avner Cohen, a former Israeli religious affairs official who worked in Gaza for more than two decades, told the Wall Street Journal in 2009. Back in the mid-1980s, Cohen even wrote an official report to his superiors warning them not to play divide-and-rule in the Occupied Territories, by backing Palestinian Islamists against Palestinian secularists. ‚ÄúI ‚Ä¶ suggest focusing our efforts on finding ways to break up this monster before this reality jumps in our face,‚Äù he wrote.‚ÄúWhen I look back at the chain of events, I think we made a mistake,‚Äù David Hacham, a former Arab affairs expert in the Israeli military who was based in Gaza in the 1980s, later remarked.Netanyahu to his Likud party members 2019:‚ÄúAnyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas ‚Ä¶ This is part of our strategy ‚Äì to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank.‚Äùhttps://www.vox.com/23910085/netanyahu-israel-right-hamas-gaza-war-history
Smells like double standards in here, have the IDF never had a briefing about ROE and how the Western world operates in a war zone? Unbecoming behaviour in the world stage will have its consequences
A confused grandma? They drive as slow as mine, can just picture them squinting over the steering wheel before realising its a fucking tank blocking their way to the grocery store.
so they waited until the car was driving away to shoot...? Not sure of what that's supposed to be pretty telling, that they just shoot everything?
Don't put words in my mouth. I didn't say they "deserving to die".Israel have no ather option, if it doesn't destroy Hamas israeli civilians will die.Hamas uses human shields, so destroying it will Inevitably result in palastinian civilians getting killed. Aither way, civilians will die. Israel has an obligation to choose its own citizens and not the enemy's. When the Palestinians decided to attack they should have taken this into account.Their deaths are tragic, but its Hamas's responsibility All options are bad, but that's the least worst available for israel.
"Why is Israel doing this???"  \*launches more rockets at civilian population centers"\*  "Why are they so mean to us?"
Yes, and again, I've read in the WaPo, WSJ, and NYT in recent days that aid organizations are saying their aid vehicles and even hospitals are running out of fuel.
Israel is one of the most solid allies the US has had in the region and provides somewhat safe harbor to ships. It‚Äôs strategically close to the Suez Canal which is an important passage for goods and fuel. Add to this major strategic importance is that Israelis tend to have a higher level of producing high-end research, in particular the pharmaceutical industry come to mind. If you ever heard of Teva, they produce so many generic medications that the US has. Chances are that you or someone in your family most definitely has a Teva medication in their cabinet (ie. Asthma inhalers come to mind.) So yeah, a few million is a drop in the bucket of investment compared to how much the US receives through a partnership. However, I think these actions are putting the US in a very uncomfortable situation as the government recognizes the loss to civilians and is having a very difficult time threading the needle now.
Putin got declared a war criminal for deporting Ukrainian children to Russia.The ICRC needs to look at that car
If a civilian is not scared to drive up to a tank during a war then that civilian must have huge balls.
Didn't you hear them say "It's coming right for us!"?
They forgot to ask him, if he condemns Hamas though, Piers Morgan wouldn't have made that mistake
This is the main road connecting gaza city to al bureij. this isn't in the north that the israelis said to evacuate from. this is a main road in the middle of gaza, adjacent to farmlands, which the tanks went over to get to. standing in the road they effectively cut off the main route between gaza city and bureij, which both still have tens of thousands of civilians in them and moving between themedit: listening to the video again as they're driving away and running away in the end of the video the journalist says there was a family in that car
No, they didn't. You are misinformed.https://youtu.be/5AJlfW0g2rk?si=1Dy-qEmVh0NqeRV4
I‚Äôve been commenting this a lot, but you guys are making some big assumptions from 17 seconds of video.  You have absolutely no idea what the lead-in to any of this was.Given the same exact video of the same situation with another force going to war with a guerrilla group that absolutely uses civilian vehicles, yes, I would give the same responses.I agree that the comment ‚Äúwhat do you expect driving in an active war zone‚Äù is off-base and basically defending the murder of civilians, but all the comments screaming this is a war-crime are unfounded without further evidence.
did they carry the rockets into the settlements? Has anyone alleged that that damage was caused by a rocket? Why are you ignoring the central thesis of the video?
How is Hamas terrorists and IDF is not. IDF is killing people is West Bank that has no Hamas and did not start oct. 7th
You just called a dead newborn baby a terrorist and you‚Äôre asking me what‚Äôs wrong with my head?
Russians - "we're going to war in Ukraine because there are Nazis there"Also Russians - "let's hunt down thus plane of Jewish people and subject them to verbal and physical abuse"
You don't get to shoot a civilian car running away just on the chance it could have been a VBIED.  They were already fleeing.
Thanks, it's pretty bad but thankfully my kids are older now so I have zero contact with him. It's scary how quickly someone can turn though.
or maybe combatants not wanting to get smoked by a tank, no one knows
What are they supposed to do? Throw rocks? Defending will ALWAYS be more expensive than attacking.
cutting of gaza city
This is what the comment section of Russian social media must have looked like when that video of the BMP shredding an elderly couple's car surfaced.
I wonder if they will pump gas into them like we did to the japanese
don't worry like all the other clips, they destroyed a hamas weapons cache and tunnel system with that tank shot
They were literally turning around and leaving.  Do civilians making a mistake justify immediate killing?  Imagine if that was your mother in that car trying to leave a warzone and she comes on a tank.
Russia warned ukrainians to leave too, I guess all their warcrimes now justified.
Reasonably you give warning shots unless fired upon, unless the enemy is known to use dead on collision card bombs like ISIS
Since when do ieds have glowing streaks?
No of course not. This sub is so fucking sad since the start of this conflict. We have absolutely no context of what happened in that situation here and people jump to conclusions to defend that tank crew.
literal mentality of if muslim/arab=terrorist if white=civillian  Sub went mask off.
Nothing to do with hamas
This car was running away though it wasn't going for the tank.
Thats one hell of a dieselpunk dozer if i ever saw one
No way he was just driving and was recording the vehicles ? Why would he be in a building I feel like he‚Äôs pretty close to that ied and he‚Äôd be the first person they expected
That shit was crazy. Really showed that even if the RUAF had taken Kyiv, they weren't going to have an easy time keeping hold of it
And turning away from tanks?
Out of courtesy, I don‚Äôt think I ever downvoted a comment that was already negative until I read this. Dude or dudette needs to put their thinking cap back on or at least be like, ‚Äúyeah that was kind of stupid of me.‚Äù But I do give them credit for not deleting their initial comment, or at least recognizing that button doesn‚Äôt even exist.
War, even skirmishes are expensive I‚Äôm sure both governments have weighed the costs of their decisions better than we can.
If the world saw what they do they will cause cracks in the make believe system they are fabricating
&gt;as soon as the US falls who will stop the neighbouring arabs from going to town on these Israelis? Israel themselves ? Or are you one of those people who believe Israel would crumble without US support ? They didn't have US support in 1948 and 1967, Arab armies are shit tier even to this day and won't stand much of a chance. Also, ideologies might not be killed but just like in WWII you can make sure that people realise what happens to you if you espouse it.
Many of the 3000$ rockets that are poorly tarfeted to "open areas" are not intercepted, and don't do damage, which shifts this balance by some factor (which I don't know)
I also wonder how much those apartment buildings cost versus the $100k missile vs. the $3k missile. I can tell you those apartment buildings, offices, markets, restaurants, and not to mention those countless lives add up to a lot more than a $100k missile, let alone several million of them.
That was pretty damning.
It's a IDF Tank in action shooting a civilian car point blank. "It must belong to Hama's" Wtf. This is a slaughter.
Yes, that's how virtue signaling works. Another term for you, strawman argument. You and the comment I replied to are examples of it. The first one - just because people might demand verification of the data/numbers doesn't mean that they deny or condemn said data/numbers.And you - no one has an issue with someone saying the killing of the innocent civilians is bad.It's the 0 acknowledgement of Hamas reporting suspicious numbers (e.g. the hospital bombing).
The fleeing white car was an obvious combat vehicle with capabilities on par with cv90 or bmp. Did you not see the tow launcher in the backseat?
I see what you did there lol.
A lot of cars in Gaza still has fuel as people always stockpile fuel for any conflict so that they can run their engines to charge the batteries and use the car battery to charge their phones or for lighting. But most of the cars that roam the strip at the moment are rescue teams as their isn't enough ambulances to cover all the strip as the bombing targets more and more of civilian filled apartments.
TENNO HEIKA BANZAI!
Agree, but the look on hamas face when all rockets are intercepted is priceless.
&gt;Wasn't it exactly this why Putin got declared a war criminal?Not actually. He was convicted of the deportation of Ukrainian children
Threat‚Ä¶.neutralized?
I'm not trying to patronise or insult you, but please educate yourself on the lived reality of the palestinian people.[what the founding of Israel entailed](https://youtu.be/rGVgjS98OsU?si=TuUVurbSwTH5qjzB)[the trailer for an Israeli documentary telling the story of just one village during the ethnic cleansing of Palestine, in the words of the Israelis who were there](https://youtu.be/HNtrUjUNkJw?si=5xZQ21aPWKtPsdbM)[why the US unconditionally supports Israel](https://youtu.be/rGVgjS98OsU?si=TuUVurbSwTH5qjzB)
The ideology may never die but you can definitely cripple the adherent's capacity to wage war. It's almost Godwinning to bring it up, but WW2 is a prime example of defeating a nation ruled by a hateful idoelogy.&gt; soon as the US falls who will stop the neighbouring arabs from going to town on these Israelis?I imagine in this fever dream of yours, Shavit II launch vehicles equipped with 500kg nuclear payloads will stop them. I doubt that will ever come to pass though, Saudi Arabia already wants to resume normalization with Israel after this war, and the rest of the gulf states will eventually do the same.
Using my Hurt Locker knowledge, any car dragging it's arse like that probably has the boot full of explosives.....or all their worldly possessions
Yahwespeed.
Their former foreign minister now works for a media organization (meaning propaganda platform) in Russia. Austria's politic is such a shitshow
What is seen clearly in the eyes of a watcher from a different perspective might not be so clear to a tank commander tasked with defending the crews lives. I don't clear them from blame but rather admits that a single video from a single perspective cannot shed enough light on this situation
Yeah, I do as well, and there‚Äôs living people on the receiving end of that blast.

It's reddit bro, it is to be expected, everyone sees one clip with no context and made up their minds
Appreciate the insight brother.
I'm an Iraqi, and I know plenty of people who think that. I used to have that mindset myself, growing up in a Muslim household with some pretty fucked up worldviews. It was always Jews this Jews that. People in discord servers were literally giddy with excitement over the hospital. It was like finding out Santa is real, to them. Many were bummed when it ended up being fake, but a lot of people don't want to accept it because it means they were wrong
Yeah war doesn‚Äôt work like that mate, you have to fix the things the missiles hit, also the price of lives and the political ramifications of not stopping the missiles.
Your second and third observations are impossible to infer from this video and are probably stemmed in pre-determined prejudice you have towards the IDF...The way people connect the dots in these kind of situation is highly irresponsible. Always rely on facts and testimonies from all perspectives.Unfortunately your emotional view on the matter is common in people sitting on their couch 2000 miles away and watch videos without context...It is your responsibility to educate yourself on any matter that you feel the urge to comment publicly about. Any other behavior is akin to spreading misinformation whether if by accident or purposefully.
At the same time. We should have higher standards for ourselves and our fellow man than ones that would place this person on a pedestal.  Yes, he is undoubtedly a good man. A person of conscience. We need more of him, desperately. But isn't it an example of what's wrong that this should be an example of virtue. This should be normal! He's just acknowledging the shared humanity of fellow people. I don't want to drag him down. I shared this video as an example to us all. But this should be normal. It is the zionists and those who can stomach, let alone cheer on their ideology and methods who should be categorised abnormal. As mentally and emotionally unwell to be able to believe and do the things they do.
Really? Ask yourself where these tunnels are located and why pretty much all of them are built intentionally right underneath civilian infrastructures in the area. By doing so, everyone knows damn well that the civilians in Gaza are purposefully being pulled into this conflict by Hamas. So yes, Hamas "guerilla warfare" absolutely involves using civilian by design.
Virtue signalling is condemning the killing of innocent civilians nowadays, is it?
SILENCE YOU WENCH
Was Palestine actually ever a country and didnt Israel offer A 2 state solution and then was attacked? In war the winner takes the land tbh
So since Russians had Crimea and other parts of Ukraine, the wat is okay, right? By your logic Russia can go on and claim Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia too.
the rule is only do it if your rear armor can handle multiple tank rounds.
As someone who understands the Arabic being said the guys with camera are discussing how this guy in the car is ‚Äúgone‚Äù in a concerned voice and that‚Äôs before the tank fired then the other guys says there‚Äôs a tank you need to take a ‚Äúphoto‚Äù basically they want to document what‚Äôs about to happen. Nothing about the time or language indicating that this was planned and I‚Äôm not sure why the guy in the car would sacrifice himself for no reason at all.
the car turned away from the tank
GoodGood for Doujin plots about bad guys get punishment. Too good of an ending for terrorist but...
I was made in Israel bro
When the main cannon misses,There's always the machine gun.
This is harrowing to watch. The news outlets sanitize a lot of their footage. Israel is committing mass murder and major countries suchas: America, Britain, France, and others, are all lining up to back them. Instead of calling for restraint
It really sells just how short range these systems work from. That is point blank range as far as air defence is concerned.
I mean in all fairness mate, Hamas‚Äô propaganda does ask people to die as martyrs for the cause. They also class all innocent civilian deaths as martyrs so it‚Äôs not that implausible to think they were willing to take on a tank in the name of martyrdom.Also, my comment wasn‚Äôt pro-israeli &amp; some other comments that aren‚Äôt pro-israeli aren‚Äôt exactly being downvoted. It‚Äôs called having a discussion, and everyone‚Äôs welcome to sharing their views.What people do take an issue with though is the putting words into their mouths, when they‚Äôve not even been said. People will ask what 1+1 is and someone will reply why they‚Äôre asking about popcorn.
What is this, the building version of the Battleships?
If the situation was the exact same as this, where the enemy has IEDS and VBIEDs, in civilian vehicles,  and  do not have uniforms, then probably yes.
The ones in Gaza will be refilling the Hamas ranks in due course.
Hamas isn't just a group of people, it's an ideology, when the orphaned kids of gaza grow up who do you think they will blame for the rockets that killed their parents? Who do you think hamas members are? They are the kids of the 2014  gaza-Israel war, all the arabs stand with hamas and the palastinians right to the land. Hamas by its name may be eliminated but they ideology will never be. Also, all empires come to an end, ask the Egyptians, Babylonians, Romans, and even the arabs. as soon as the US falls who will stop the neighbouring arabs from going to town on these Israelis? It's only a matter of time, and regardless of my hatred to Israel I hope this conflict ends somewhat clean like when the Irish gained independent instead of another holocaust............. My opinion as a Pro-kicking the western settlers out of palastine/Israel.
[deleted] always says that kind of crap!
Commenters here are just saying we can't conclude anything from a 25 second video. You'd think people would have learned their lesson after the hospital strike.

614 C.E Persian conquest of Jerusalem.
Right ??
It indeed does look like one. We can‚Äôt see who is in the car but it doesn‚Äôt look good for the IDF
Nuts that a civilian vehicle turned around driving the other way gets deleted and people here acting like that's okay. The times we've seen the Russians doing the same thing the reaction was a bit different.
Good eye!
I think ‚Äúin action‚Äù is understating what seems like firing at a civilian vehicle that was clearly trying to turn around after realizing what‚Äôs about to happen.
The american embassy has fallen
This is a pretty stupid take. Hamas *is* on the WB, too. They have less control, but they're there. Also, Hamas is not the only actor. There are plenty of terror orgs in the WB that work with Hamas.
Yes, it's not complicated. Hamas is terrorists, Palestine is not. Israel is a pitbull on America's leash building war machines. I'm actually fairly pro Israel (as a people not the genocidal government agency) but also pro Palestine (also as a people, not the pro terrorist government agency). Screw the murderers and the racism. Support the people to live freely.Edit: just clarifying again that I support a race and the freedom to follow an ancient religious theology, while condemning the government state of Israel. Two things with one name. Which means I also support freedom of religion while opposing the belief of some religions which teach harming others. You can support the good while condemning the bad. Like loving a family member who is justifiably going to prison.
I saw Namer (merkava based APC) at a petrol station on a truck 2 weeks ago. What a sexy beast!! It looks waay more beautiful in person!
He's right? You don't need to like your enemy to appreciate their tactics.
Good man. Very brave for speaking out. Israel clearly is committing genocide.
With 3,000 children dead since 7th October.[https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/3-000-children-in-gaza-killed-by-israel-since-oct-7-palestines-un-envoy/3033715](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/middle-east/3-000-children-in-gaza-killed-by-israel-since-oct-7-palestines-un-envoy/3033715)
This. This is why reddit is dead.
Hate that thing. 50 year old ancient piece of shit that breaks if you kick it with your leg too hard.
Aren‚Äôt most given to them in the form aid by the US anyway? Or the least, funded by the US‚Äô military aid?But let‚Äôs say they didn‚Äôt spend $10m on 100 missiles, how much financial &amp; human damage would those 100 missiles cause?
Fellas, what should be road rules for overtaking a tank?Should I honk thrice and turn on my blinkers?
Iran
Well, that tank there certainly thought they‚Äôre fair game. Wake the fuck up.
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but even aid organizations have been saying there is no fuel to run *hospitals* and aid vehicles for days now. Supposedly, Hamas uses fuel to run their tunnel ventilation, rockets, etc. If only one group has fuel in an enclave that has been under siege for weeks with no way to get fuel in, maybe they made an assumption about the only way a car is on the road after weeks of siege is if the fuel came from Hamas?  I suppose it's possible that a civilian has just been carefully hoarding their fuel for the last few weeks and just happened to be going about their business
The Israeli vehicles have evolved but they prevented the Palestinians from developing more sophisticated weapons
Heisenberg style.
not the fucjking hamas fanart(horny ) naahhhhh
Safe to assume its a press crew then.
It was BMP, here is the video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IxZS82CW9EQ
Imagine the same scenario but with a russian tank in Ukraine. Redditors would be justifiably outraged, but this is different because Israel are the GoodGuys‚Ñ¢.
They also crushed and flipped civilian cars.Something tells me, the Russians didn't think those cars were IED strapped vehicles.
you really need to learn some facts: 1. the city is jenin and nobody is kicking them from jenin2. Palestinians don't have a country yet3. the IDF doesn't bomb jenin at the momentstop spreading lies.
If I was invading a civilian town to flatten it, I'd pick the armoured Bulldozer to ride in, not the Landrover.
Hamommy
That's like half of the annual salary there.
If you take Ukraine as an example, they don‚Äôt have a lot of precedents for civilian vehicles loaded up with explosives and being used to blow up tanks. So when it happened there you could be 99% sure it was war crimes.  In the middle east however, especially after ISIS, that is a very real danger. There are many many examples of this on the combat subteddits.Not everything is black and white.
&gt;civilian vehicleDoes Hamas have anything else other than a civilian vehicle? I don't think they have heavy weapons of a regular army.
No, this is a diehard pro-Israel sub, and you *will* assume any and all IDF actions are always taken in good faith with the best intentions possible, pretty much angelic really, while all Palestinian actions are always with evil ulterior motives, and probably part of some intricate Hamas plan involving at least 7 war crimes, so if you think about it their walking around their homes is pretty much equivalent to the 7 war crimes that they were secretly planning on doing had the heroic IDF not stopped them first. Be careful about suggesting anything else, or prepare to get downvoted out of visibility.Of course any Palestinian civilian would be willing to get blasted by a tank if it means Hamas might get a few seconds of footage that looks slightly bad for Israel. How deviously fiendish of those (insert your favourite slur for muslims or brown people)
That's kinda of what happens when you repeat the "Jesus was black" lie.
Get your point, but given how it panned out for Stalin‚Äôs lot, a little ironic*As you may recall from your days in the seminary, Mr Dzugashvili‚Ä¶ our divisions are legion*
If you drive fast near a military force you present yourself as a potential threat from the get-go and risk getting shot. It‚Äôs a mandate to slow down. Lived through wartime myself, albeit the forces we drove by were not actively engaging in a combat. These people had it right, except the driving towards the tank part.
Nothing biased here. Just humanity and empathy. And also, the daily mail is a racist peice of shit rag.
Unless they confirmed the guys in the car are militants there is no excusing that holy shit
sorry the correct name is "sponge bomb"yes it's on propose
Cheapest i can find is 3800AUD which is around 2.4k USD. for just the lens.
No, but if that is a civilian car with civilians in it, then this is straight up murdering civiians.
Bollox.
&gt;Have HAMAS used drone dropped grenades?yes it manage to set front engine of Merkava on fire
No, they're all busy acting like they know its a suicide bomber and the car following them is filming a propaganda film. Its not like there are hundreds of international journalists stuck in Gaza.
Haha üòÑ. More like, I want to impregnate them with my zionist missile.
Might be press
This is half way to the sea
Without further information this looks like murdering civilians. And no sane person should defend that. Keep in mind that we may not have all information here. But I am afraid we will see a lot of those videos in the future.
VBIEDS very well known to flip u turns as they approach their target
How much?
By Saving Our GirlsKony 2023
Maybe civilians who don‚Äôt know ? .. just a guess
Welp, they couldn't do it. Maybe it's some state propaganda account and they are not allowed to give any concessions, maybe they are unhinged terrorists supporter. I appreciate your approach anyway.
But the vehicle was clearly turning around. This is incredibly difficult for Israel to defend
snap out of it.  we've seen from ukraine/russian war that anyone could be driving slowly up to a tank out of fear.front vehicle couldve been the same type of vehicle as the video recorder, innocent lives
I think RuZZia should denazifi themselves lol.
Israel provides advanced medical procedures to Russians all the time does not matter jews or not
Taking notes from the Russians I see
the tank was 1. literally hiding behinde a building and 2. clearly saw that the vehicle turned around and 3. waited to kill them until they actvely started driving away. say what you want. this just looks like the scene where the russian btr executed two elderly in their cars. just worse.
Wow, this thread makes my blood boil. Shame on all of you for thinking that killing civilians who took a wrong turn and are already in the process of backing out is somehow justified.
its unreal how many rockets they had before all this happened.
i think you know the answer...
Have you seen Instagram and Twitter? It's fuckin disgusting. Although I'm sure 90% of the accounts that flood that shit online are russian and chinese bots. It's working tho.
Yes because unlike redditors, real humans aren't hiveminds.
They were turning around though. They probably saw the tank and noped out of there only to be hit
Filming war crimes
add them to the list...
The thing is, there was no news of IDF forces driving up the center border of Gaza, this is the Saladin road a main road that connects the south with north of Gaza and also is connected with the netsirim border crossing. These might be elderly people driving the car and have not seen the tank until it was too late, mind you the road is curved so that small building might have covered the tank before it pushed forward.
A literal progrom. In 2023. Antisemitism is horrible. Russia hasn't evolved since 1905.
Maybe don't bring your children to a place of confrontation?
Occupation gets people killed
About 200,000 palestinian go in and out to israel from the west bank each day, some to work some to medical care, the fact is that as much as u want to make sure no one carries a weapon you just can't. Iran is also known to smuggle firearms through the Israeli Jordan border. Don't get me wrong I ain't saying that whatever my country is doing is 100% right, I criticize them more than everyone but saying that the West Bank is under lockdown and nothing can go in and out is quite stretching of what the IDF can do.Btw I appreciate the fact I am not banned yet.
They are Holocaust deniers so yah weird times
They clearly were turning around so they could reveal the anti tank missile array in the cargo bay smh
Interestingly enough, Israel doesn‚Äôt really care for saving the hostages, as they‚Äôve stated many times.
But but Hamas, but but but.. Human shields, lets see how they are going to justify this murder on this sub.
Welp, guess its time for some Gas into the tunnels, you better pray hostages are alive =).Gureilla fighters are not protected under Geneva Convention btw, Gas is fair game against them.
You really shouldn't respond to people killing young people with kids by killing....more young people with kids.
With this logic then 9/11 was justified as revenge bacause usa killed many muslims(Your logic not mine)Cmon..Only the shitheads try to justify civilians deaths.Bet you would not have the balls to say that in the face of a palestinian orphan.So easy talking about people "deserving to die" behind your keyboard
That video was from the early days of the February 2022 invasion. Russian BTRs shot indiscriminately at anything that was moving.
It sadly never went away ... not even remotely. It's crazy how deeply embedded it is in religion and societies. I don't think it will disappear anytime soon, either. It's just too easy to have this one group to take all the blame for everything past and future.
Worked out for Vietnam v Cambodia/Khmer Rouge. UN would complain, but for 30 years later, no more border incursions, which is quite good.
The IDF is so far the best prepared army in the world, they make the U.S. army look like amateurs.
Recon through firepower. Drones are watching Hamas movement and then they just blast the building they entered.
Just like Russia in Ukraine
Gotta break some eggs to make an omelette
Would all the comments here excusing the tank destroying a civilian vehicle as it drives away be here if it wasn‚Äôt an Israeli tank?
If it's Ukrainians getting killed, reddit gets sad. But if it's palastinans getting killed, then "they've been warned to evacuate" and "we can't tell that this isn't hamas"The bias in the entirety of reddit pisses me off, and It really sucks that when you ask people to even consider a second opinion, you get downvoted/deleted.
Haha just watched that ied video too.
That‚Äôs very convenient.
I give little credibility to these reports even through it‚Äôs probable that some people have returned north, the flow of people is clearly southward.Reasons why I think like this:There is a difference of several orders of magnitude in the intensity of the bombings between the north and the southAnother water pipe has been opened in order to increase the water flow to the south (that‚Äôs 2 out of a total of 3)The flow of aid has been significantly increased in the south so people get an incentive to go and stay thereThere still is a communications blackout in the north
Just checked the price on those. God. Damn.
the marker is in wrong place, the tank is probably more in the open space between Gaza city and the marker
What foam?
Now that you cant blame this civilian for being a hamas human shield we are going to call him a Hamas AT-team, wow the inhumanity on this sub justifying for broad daylight warcrimes.
What's the quota Israel has to fill? When will Bibi be satisfied?
Yeah, Palestinians should be thankful for only getting killed by the hundreds and not thousands.
Omg your right! Left side infront of the building!
Oh yeah, I'm so confused about the plight of the Palestinians and the complete disregard of anyone from Burma or Africa. It boggles my mind. Also, the Uyghurs. Just so confusing.
they don't..   it is an automated targeted effort.  \`hasbara\`:  There are apps and thousands of people working to try to affect public opinion and make it look like the common consensus is something that it is not.   Sometimes they also try to create opposition to their genocide with false information and selected talking points that can be discredited and make the Israeli government look sane.   There are lobbying taking place for many decades, that attempts to lump any and all criticism of Israel together under the term "anti-semitism", resulting in laws and policies of most US states and European countries.  While anti-semitism is a real problem and should always be addressed, labeling all critique of Israel under that term, is at the moment working against Israel as everyone now can see the horrors of their actions, policies, apartheid state and concentration camps and illegal settlement violence, and can easily understand that critique and anti-semitism is not the same.    The Israeli government should NEVER be thought of as equal to Jewish people in general, just as Hamas should never be thought of as equal to the Palestinian people.   The  Israeli government is so fanatical that it has in many ways lost touch with reality. That means that it believes it is in control in ways it is not. Sadly it also means they will have to use other means if the swaying of public opinion fails.   I expect horrible things to come
L-series zoom lens on a canon too.
Merkava vs skoda
They are bombing the south too, this doesn't justify this crime. And this is not the north this is the center of Gaza the tanks are moving in to encircle gaza into two pockets.
Seems like a potential warcrime.
Bro i was sarcastic i serve in the IDF im not a woke idiot
Taking north also means less rockets to reach into Central Israel. Only the better ones. But "taking north" is not as easy as cutting it off, of course. We are talking about Gaza city itself.
Yes, [here's how they destroyed a Merkava on the first day of the war](https://twitter.com/CalibreObscura/status/1710595943664329027?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1710595943664329027%7Ctwgr%5Eba4788685a508d2680f13aff820802023add1f74%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularmechanics.com%2Fmilitary%2Fweapons%2Fa45561784%2Fisrael-cope-cage-armor%2F)Using a AT grenade, also used quadcopter drones to destroy towers;
We rebuilt *West* Germany, and there was a reason for that.
A while before the war there were some Jews who went to Israel then came back because they couldn't adopt to the different country (even though there are a lot of Russian speaking Jews in Israel from former Soviet Union not just Russia)
Actually (let the downvotes come) the statement from our austrian foreign ministry makes sense:  "A resolution in the UN General Assembly that is not even able to name the terrorist organization Hamas cannot be supported by Austria,‚Äù said a statement from the Foreign Ministry on Friday evening. "Nor can we support a resolution that does not grant Israel the right to self-defense in the face of terror guaranteed under international law. As a result, Austria voted against this resolution in the UN General Assembly."  Also its not like the UN vote would actually lead to something...
ok, 400,000 remaining are ok to kill then?
With full solidarity, at this point in the current climate of polarisation, and the rampant hasbara this sub is facing. Be real clear about sarcasm, like beyond a. /s! A straight message of respect for her not being brainwashed would go further to stating your position and helping other people of conscience feel less alone. ‚úåüèº
Yes they have, but it‚Äôs also good for downforce in fast corners
Govori≈° to kao da veƒá nije garantirano da ƒáe ih dobiti
Dang if I was driving and I came up on a tank I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd take the time for a 3 point turn around.Just reverse on out of there.
Tanks in a city is precisely the thing that Hamas and their anti-tank troops have waited for.
Doesn't Austria also have a slight issue in that they're not entirely sure who their intelligence services work for?
Austrian here: Do not worry, our university of art learned and now lets everybody in.
Wasn't it exactly this why Putin got declared a war criminal? Reminds me of the elderly couple (among many other civilian family's in Ukraine) who got shot to pieces when they were trying to leave, i totally get that in a warzone its probably not the safest idea to drive around and approach tanks and such. That being said, the tank also has excellent optics, IF it was a civilian car filled with a family the crew must have seen it. I think we are going to see alot of crazy footage in the days to come..
Here is an article from about a decade ago about the policy of giving Depo-Provera shots to Ethiopian women immigrants to Israel.  https://www.timesofisrael.com/ethiopian-women-claim-israel-forced-them-to-use-birth-control-before-letting-them-immigrate/Here is an article from about how, ‚Äú*As mentioned before, during the 1960s and 1970s, Israel applied a birth reducing policy among women of Asian and north-African origin. The birth control technique recommended to those communities by the medical authorities was IUD. Gynecologists explained that Mizrachi women are ‚Äòprimitive women who cannot be responsible in their daily lives‚Äô, and added that ‚Äòthey and their reproductive organs‚Äô should be supervised.*‚Äù  http://isha.org.il/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/◊ì◊§◊ï-◊ê◊†◊í◊ú◊ô◊™.pdfMost of the doctors in Israel at the time were European- or American-trained Ashkenazi Jews, or their students. Many would have ascribed to racist, ethnocentric, and religiocentric ideas taught at the time. So that might explain their attitude.‚Äú*One of the early incidents that exposed this approach was the revelation in the 1990s that the Israeli national blood bank had routinely destroyed blood donated by Ethiopian Israelis for fear of HIV.*‚Äù  https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-32813056It is similar to how Ethiopia Jews had to take on Ashkenazi Jewish customs, such as no longer allowing the Ethiopian Jews to have monks, a tradition dating back well over a millennium.https://www.haaretz.com/jewish/2012-01-18/ty-article/israel-putting-end-to-millenia-old-tradition-of-ethiopian-jewish-priests/0000017f-efd7-dc28-a17f-fff7f9480000And it wasn‚Äôt until 2018 that Ethiopian Jewish priests (*kesim*) were recognized by Israel as legitimate religious authorities. I can‚Äôt find a source, but I believe they also had to study Talmud, though Egyptian Jews didn‚Äôt have that (they were pre-y and followed the Torah). (Some would argue that they are having to catch up with mainstream Judaism, but others would argue that it would be like having Jews (pre-Messianic) become Christians. Why else end the tradition of monkhood?)  https://www.algemeiner.com/2018/02/20/after-30-years-of-limbo-traditional-ethiopian-jewish-religious-leaders-recognized-by-israel/I recall reading something from the early 2000s about how they was also targeting Sephardic Jewish women with contraception, but I can‚Äôt find the source now. It is possible the article I read was referring to Mizrachi Jews as Sephardic Jews. As you may know, Sephardic Jews expelled from Spain over 500 years ago migrated to Morocco and various parts of the former Ottoman Empire, so they would have had extended interaction over hundreds of years with Mizrachi Jewish communities, some of whom date back millennia.Note: For /u/a-dasha-tional, I added more information on Mizrachi and Sephardic Jews. For /u/ro0ibos2, I added more information on Ethiopian Jewish practices.
I don't know, but it's starting to look like they were being baited into having exactly this response.Something tells me Hamas leaders are relaxing in some luxury compounds in Qatar or Iran, while Israel being understandably emotional and angry, goes and in their anger, slowly turns the world against them.
Are we going to ignore how the palestine Commission called for a holy war against the jews in 1947?Alos, Palestine, including Gaza, is getting millions of hundreds of millions of euros. That money is supposed to be used by both Gaza and West Bank governments to develop their nations. But instead, all that Gaza has built in their 2 decade leadership is a bunch of rockets.
Yep, this looks like the next phase. Evacuation south of Wadi Gaza was declared some 2 weeks ago (10 days)? This is probably the beginning of the taking of the North. Unless it's some limited incursion into center of the Strip, which would be weird.
Makes sense, a few  experts predicted a basic condensing further of Gaza. A lot of Hamas weapons etc are run through tunnels in the north. If Israel basically wipes all that out and occupies the land it makes things very hard for Hamas in the future.
This person is historically illiterate. The Romans (who didn't have princes) named the land Palestine. A name derived from what the Greeks had called that area before them.But I want to be explicitly clear. The idea that Palestinians are Indigenous to this land is not predicated on the premise that they had ancestors that lived there thousands of years ago - even though genetic tests have shown Palestinians have a much caananite (the people who lived on this land before even the Hebrew peoples did) geneology as any Jewish person alive today - because that is FUCKING STUPID! As stupid as it's ours because God put it in his will. His human lawyer-prophet wrote it all in this legally binding book that has changed languages at least half a dozen times since it was written.
Would you have engaged after that civilian car had fully turned around in front of you?
Oh man I‚Äôd hate for my life to be saved by a 100 thousand dollar missile
This engagement seems wildly irresponsible on the part of the tank crew. Many Gazan first responders and volunteers drive towards smoke in order to save people trapped under rubble, to drive people to hospital, etc. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if these guys were driving towards the smoke (probs assuming it was an air strike), didn‚Äôt see the tank and also didn‚Äôt realize a tank would even possibly be there given that the ground incursions are really recent, then got blown up. They were heading away at the time the tank shot them and clearly were not violently engaging in any way whatsoever. Reminds me of the old Ukrainian couple blown up by the Russians.
Maybe it is a tracer? Most direct firing projectiles have a tracer component
Difference is that west bank has been under lock down since 2007, meaning almost everything going in and out of west bank has been controlled by idf.
Here's a screen grab of that strange projectile. I have no clue what it is except it's definitely incendiary:  https://imgur.com/a/knebPQn
I get that Hamas killing civilians was the igniter to the fire but just bombing civilians as retaliation is just as despicable.
Utilizing tunnels for the purposes of fighting in battle sounds exactly like guerrilla warfare. Whether civilians are involved or not has nothing to do with it.
You must be pretty tired of life driving a car with a camera in an active warzone where one part of the team dresses as civilians
Because warning civilians is only *part* of the situations.  The other part is that Hamas habitually embeds its combatants in civilian groups, and fight in civilian clothes.   In light of that whole context, a **seemingly** civilian vehicle in an area that's been warned for weeks to evacuate, travelling towards the border and away from the evacuation zone, heading *closer* to a plainly visible 75-ton tank... Well if I were the TC I probably would have engaged much sooner.
If those were civilians then this is tragic but you Don't just drive towards a tank in an active warzone where soldiers are obviously on edge and expect to be Ignored.
Lol ok
No its now how guerilla war works. That how terrorists work. The difference is who hides behind civilians and childdren.
You‚Äôre welcome
Indeed, by breaking international law.
They do a pretty good job of defending themselves. But its neither here nor there for you and me to decide who is right or wrong. Lets just enjoy the footage for what it is :)
Except they did, more than 700,000 people have fled south out of the 1.1 million people in North Gaza
"Don't be a civilian in a war against Isra√´l"
If Israel truly intends to destroy Hamas then it will need to clear the entire strip. Even if the South is nominally safer now it seems likely that the fighting will eventually roll over the civilians sheltering there.
After the invasion of Iraq I think every country is wary of civilian automobiles driving up to tanks.
Yes. If they want to be safe, then yes.
Yeah, it‚Äôs a shame Israel doesn‚Äôt follow international law, leading the Palestinians to their demise.
Seal and destroy.
I know. These guys are just terrorists who have no sympathy for their own civilians they so heavily advertise they fight for.
So, is everyone a war crimes lawyer now?
There where Ukrainian civilians trowing molotovs from civilian cars at invading tanks and military vehicles in the first weeks of the invasion.Does this make all civilians valid targets? Ofcourse not.
&gt;are fair gameNot "fair game", nobody said nothing about them being 'fair game'. You pulled that thing from thin air.
That‚Äôs kinda how guerrilla warfare works.
Bro said if you gonna kill me we all gonna die
In that case, Funny how they shot when the car was turning around
That doesn‚Äôt make them fair game you lunatic
So what did they think when the car started turning arround then?
And back into the tunnels they ran to hide whilst their civilians didn't get the same level of security. Hamas is evil.
Czech and proud
You are forgetting the investment is on civilian safety. Sure the missile aint cheap but the money that's poured into it is saving lives. And I believe they are looking into laser interception which will drastically reduce cost of operation whilst still maintaining that peak prevention.
Hahaha. Gaza ‚Äúofficials‚Äù are just HAMAS making up stuff for propaganda purposes.

can none of you really not see the dude throwing it?  I mean technically it's still an IED but a pipebomb or homemade grenade of some type.
Reminder to self, ‚Äòdon‚Äôt approach a tank in my car in an active war zone‚Äô.
clearly, she's brainwashed /s
Cringe beards
With the high failure rate of hamas rockets and the high intercept rate of iron dome there are more failed rockets that hit inside the gaza strip than are coming through and are hitting israel.Only a madman would be using a weapon which is more likely to kill your own people than your enemys.
Let me guess, they were all arrested and are now facing charges for breaching security zones, invading the airport tarmac and rioting/public disturbance?Right?Right?
Maybe they didn‚Äôt expect the tank to already be there.It‚Äôs at Netsarim crossing on Salah-a-din (main axis north south) and holding it means cutting the Gaza Strip in half. It‚Äôs really impossible to draw conclusions at this point.Edit: Given the fuel situation in Gaza, it‚Äôs fair to assume that any moving vehicle (probably except ambulances) at least obtained the fuel through Hamas.
Reports in Israeli media the tanks are at the form Netzarim junction, not far from the center of Gaza city.Reports that groups of terrorists are approaching and trying to neutralize the tanks now.
They spend $100,000 to intercept rockets that cost less than $3000.They‚Äôre just throwing money at the problem. It would be more impressive if it didn‚Äôt cost so much resources.
The tank is hiding behind a building and it's not like they are painted bright yellow. And you dont know if those guys were there before the white car appeared and they saw it in a different position.
We've learned pogroms, ghettos and genocide - that's not nothing!/s  kinda.
‚Äúhow eloquent‚Äù ‚òùÔ∏èü§ì
Amen, this is the fight to end HAMAS once and for all with minimal casualties. I love that they adapted the anti-drone cages, they aren't taking any chances.
what happened to that lone guy :V

Its been reported that this location is below the gaza cityhttps://twitter.com/michaelh992/status/1718903437264384432from the looks of it, it looks like israel is planning on cutting gaza in half
Agreed brother. Cant wait for the cancer of Hamas to be removed.
TENNO HEIKABANZAIII
Yesh they even released some propaganda a few days ago flexing their drone mortar setup. Heck even rebels in Syria have started drone dropping munitions. Its part of the war landscape now. Ukraine refined it but the rest of the world is getting in on it.
Oh you supported the Hamas. You are Happy when your Hamas Brother killed civilians. What wrong in your head?
From Hamas!
Why are their tanks using the Russian roof? Have HAMAS used drone dropped grenades?Edit: I love how everyone understands the "Russian roof" term.
Oh you supported the Hamas. You supported the Terror. What wrong in your head? You are Happy when your Hamas Brother killed civilians. And this is Israel Land.
I've seen party poppers with more umph.
Don't forget that the engine bay is the next target for a drone hit if the turret is too protected.
I see you one God is Great and raise you a Deus Vult.
I guess I forgot California has a land, sea, and air blockade around Tijuana and can turn off the water, gas, and electricity there too lmao
I am curious to see how this will affect tank designs. Will we see a return to the heavy tank roots with composite roof armour? Will we see top down trophy systems? I am curious how defence engineers will come around this new hurdle. Cope cages are effective but I know we will see some crazy stuff for tank designs. Its not just the front or the sides that we gotta worry about explosive charges. The top is now a prime candidate with drones.
That was a weak IED.  What are they using fireworks?
And Hamas did not let them leave, what's your point?
Free Palestine from Hamas, yes of course
must be quiet for the women over there this week.
Okay I see. So they have a passport, but since they're not recognized as a nation their passport doesn't count as proof of citizenship, is that correct? Israel is the one providing the citizenship. From what you said it seems that there's an elected Civil government, that formerly has a militant wing in the West Bank. In Gaza, the government still has it's militant wing and that's Hamas. That's sounds like FARC. Okay so if this is the case, who guarantees their rights. Kurds have had problems with being targeted for extermination in countries they're part of like Iraq, Turkey, Iran, and Syria. From the way you're describing it, they're occupied by Israel, but don't have the rights of Israelis, but they also don't have a nation to advocate on their behalf.
Also driving towards the tank's position, it's possibly an anti-tank team.
War has changed
The iron dome system really is impressive.
Yeah drone dropped mortar has proven to be an effective and efficient way to disable all modern MBT's
Aww they're playing Airsoft
Since he recorded before the IED blow-up there are two possible reasons for his recording:A. Spotter for bomb activationB. Propaganda value of the video
I know what they're for and that they're decently effective against drones, still won't stop me from calling them cope cages üòâ
This video reminded me of the video of the russian btr82 blowing up a car with 2 elderly people, they saw it and stopped, tried to reverse, btr looked at them, probably saw them through the optics and still decided to shoot them
I don't understand how people think civilians who haven't fled are fair game because they were warned.If Hamas warned Israelis they should flee areas they wanted to shoot rockets at, it doesn't put the responsibility of any casualties on Israeli civilians.
Love to see the foam tunnel bombs. Edit ‚ÄúSponge Bomb‚Äù
Why are people so dumb. They are for drone dropped munition
Over excitement mixed with some anxiety and pressure.Source: I don't wanna talk about it.
Why are they in the West Bank ?
ISIS was not in France and Nov 15 still happened because of ISIS terrorists, the fact that hamas is 'not in the West Bank' doesn't mean there are no hamas supporters who plan on committing terror attacks on israelies.
It seems rather convenient that the car recording the footage has a DSLR at the ready. Thats not some camera you would find off the shelf at some department store. This is right up the playbook of Hamas planting victims for propaganda. + with the city being starved off fuel, who still had a tank at the ready to drive around? Doesn't Hamas control the supply to the point the local hospitals were starved off it? Just seems rather convenient, Merkavas are not quiet tanks, tanks are not quiet. Driving up to it seems abit of a risky play when you know whats going down around you.
üöÄ
But arnt hamas guilty of having their literal base underneath a hospital? They're sick and need to be destroyed. I see tonnes of fuck isreal, but not much fuck hamas. That is the problem.
‚ÄùIf there was no Hamas, Gaza would be good‚ÄùWhen there is no Hamas:
The IDF has been warning people to leave the area and go south for weeks now. For the IDF it seems a fair assumption that anyone traveling to the north at this point is likely to be with the militants.
&gt; Shohada IntersectionName checks out.
Wish them all the best. Hope they‚Äôre successful in wiping out Hamas completely.
Looks like a war from this angle. FTFY.
The fact that tank didn't immediately engage, or made the shot from afar, when vehicle was approaching, should be pretty telling. But at this point we don't know much, except what we seeing.

The logic isn't logicing with you. How did you come to the conclusion that it wasn't intentional because Gaza isn't dust? They've been intentionally abusing and killing civilian Palestinians for over 70 years now. Good luck trying to deny facts and history. What's amusing is that you're trying to deny events that are happening right now as well.
It woke the terrorist in you.
Free palestine
Not sure if you‚Äôre being deliberately disingenuous or just misinformed, but the right wing in Israel does not condemn the illegal settlement of the West Bank. The left wing does, but they have been marginalised in Israeli politics for many years.Haaretz recently reported that the redeployment of IDF forces to protect illegal settler occupations in the West Bank was part of the reason for the success of the 7th Oct attack. Look up for example Ben Gvir, the current in Netanyahus current far right coalition and his background and views.I accept he is only part of a coalition and not fully in control like Hamas in Gaza. But in my opinion unless extremist groups like his party are removed from power in Israel, alongside the removal of extremists like Hamas/PIJ from Palestine, there will never be the chance for a lasting peace.
What happens after the ceasefire?
Everyone is too much of a wimp to arm them because they know they will have righteous anger from 75 years of ethnic cleansing
yes very possible the other driver didn't notice it but when he did he tried to go back while he was still far from it
Gonna need some context. Palestinians reporting three killed at Shohada Intersection on Salah al-Din Road. This is probably it. That would mean this tank is already pretty deep in the Central Gaza. Unexpected.
Good for them! Fight the genocidal fascists, because the world is too cowardly to do anything
That is not how it works. Reacting to any radio source would actually be a great way to kill yoursef when activating the IED and there happens to be some loud radio noise nearby.
EZ Plenki Do It Now üòÇüòÇüòÇ
They do have passports and IDs and thier own juristical system. I also don't know why you're getting downvoted
&gt;inshallahWarning came years ago.  BTW "inshallah" means if God wishes/allows, akin to "c‚Äôest la vie" in french and "shit happens" in Forrest Gump from what I understand.
No thanks. I only wanted to understand, why war 1st. It's very stupid and nothing good comes from it. Don't need to read a book to understand that...
So you‚Äôre telling me two guys following at a distance with cameras know it‚Äôs there but not the people at the end of the road?
Looks like a war crime from this angle.
displacing half of 2.2 million people in the most densely populated open prison on earth and then expecting them to do so?
Are we not celebrating and burning flags anymore. What happened?
How can anyone think Israel bombed that hospital after watching one of these videos?  Some still do believe it was Israel.
someone who didn't know the tank was there, there are people in Gaza who goes to where strikes are happening to rescue
Finally, a perspective shedding light on more then just a viral video. Well done.
U jebote, uspjeh
Rumour has it, they're still at it
IDF told them to leave for 3 weeks now.
The UN is filled with antisemitic Islamic countries. That‚Äôs why.
Not saying the tank shooting is correct but who on earth would drive up to a tank really slowly then turn around really slowly?
USAF: making the landing gear components as light and small as possible to optimize for combat weight  USN: \*girth\*
I think they are just looking for this one guy called Takbir.
My ADHD brain misread this as 'How many divisions does Pepe have'? I then gave the question earnest consideration for two minutes.
why?
55 nations voted against a canadian amendment in the UN to repremand Hamas for its oct-7 atrocity which started the current war. That's a lot of "nations to build" vs. deter with the prospect of retaliation at a distance
"Only hamas can be blamed for the bombs Isreal dropped on children."
That Merkava is a technological work of beauty. And an APC as well. Stay safe fellas.
Citing yourself is not a good look.
Folks are hypersensitive on this issue.  Memes that are fine in any other context are not fine in this one.There's nothing that can be done about it though.  Just gotta thread the needle with every post and hope for the best.
If it wasn't religion, we would have invented another thing.  Unfortunately, most people just need to belong to something, and to bash on people who don't belong.  This is probably why we'll never have nice things.
If history has taught us anything, its that when something starts with the jews, it never ends with the jews. We should all be worried.
Are they firing fucking turbolasers??
I think that was an incredibly accurate representation using California as an example. Everything I said was factual, as it did happen in relation to what happened with Palestine.
Hehe Plenki ide brrrtt

Germany already packing to your rescue üòÇ
did not know that. what a bad picture this paint for palestine
It makes them an occupied territory or maybe occupied autonomous region is a better term, because it‚Äôs not a territory of Israel. And yes they have passports issued by the Palestinian authority (PA for short, their govt). It‚Äôs complicated so apologies if I didn‚Äôt make it clear. They have a government, but are not a country. Kind of like how Kurdistan has a government but it‚Äôs not a country, but an autonomous region. Autonomous means they are self governed but don‚Äôt have international recognition as a country. It gets even more complicated because the PA is the official govt but Hamas won a majority of seats including the role of PM, but they de facto rule Gaza because once they won the elections, they booted Fatah (the militia of the PA) out of Gaza. So although they are distinct groups, Hamas is now a part of the PA because they were voted into it by many Palestinians (allegedly, unsure how fair the elections were). Israel has the military might to essentially go in and do whatever they want. In the West Bank, they made a deal with the PA to control part of the West Bank as a special military zone. In the part of the West Bank that is fully controlled by the PA, Israel has less power and usually works through the PA to get what they want (Fatah will either cooperate or not). In Gaza, they (Israel) obviously don‚Äôt have that same relationship with Hamas so while they can control their border with Gaza, anytime there‚Äôs an issue it usually results in war. This probably confused you more, but if you want to know more, there are a lot of articles that came out recently about what the Palestinian Territories are and what Hamas is that may help. In the meantime I posted a link below that talks about the different zones. But if need anything else cleared up, lemme know!https://ecfr.eu/special/mapping_palestinian_politics/opt/
Ironically reprisals against Jews around the world only strengthen Israel‚Äôs claim to a country where they have the ability to determine their own destiny and security.
As far as our casualties vs the terrorists' it worked pretty well. Nation building and hearts and minds is where we failed hard. If you don't intend to do any of that nonsense and are good with a forever police state, then kicking in doors and cracking sculls will work just fine.
Don‚Äôt be dissing on Toyotas and DshKas, they‚Äôve toppled governments
At least show them being fucked IDF.And we jerk to good military hardware here, not some improvised stuff.
I mean, it makes sense. Don't want to be spied on when performing a breach.
Not to mention the intentional targeting of civilians and children, especially those who try to run after you threaten them to run.And not to mention that this is the case ever since the occupation has started.
Gaza is chic in euro-leftist circles for some unscrutable reason that probably rhymes with‚Ä¶modern history.
This is what life looks like for Palestinians when there is NOT Hamas. 140 people have been killed in the West Bank over the past 3 week by IDF terrorists
Yesterday it was Pringle's.Today its this Hamas Horny artwork.When will I stop unzipping my pants in this subreddit god dammit.(Fantastic drawing btw)
West Bank doesn‚Äôt have Hamas yet it was bombed literally today‚Ä¶.
They‚Äôre inventing words, pay them no mind and go back to plane-related masturbation.
mmmmfgh.,‚Ä¶,
They guys are the definition of radical racist ..it's not that they are ousting Palestinians over jews..it's just that they hate everyone equally ..at least who is not them and is not black.. in their eyes jews are just as bad as Palestinians.. who they feel are just as bad as white Christians.. they hate everyone equally and are eager to tell you why they hate you so much and why they believe you are better off dead in their eyes
Where were you people when the US bombed Syria to rubble about ISIS? Lol. This is what happens to terrorists.
History will tell the story how the palestinians had a chance to a 2 state solution multiple times but rejected it  because they wanted all the jews dead. It came back to haunt them though because Israel is never going to lose this and there is nothing the likes of you can do about it except spread lies on TikTok.
I honestly thought UN ceasefires applied only to formal armies. So, if Hamas is the army of a sovereign nation, wouldn‚Äôt they be already in a top spot wrt war crimes?
+1 If you happen to be white, look gay, or if you‚Äôre just minding you‚Äôre own business they‚Äôll try shouting shit at you just to talk shot to anyone with a different opinion. It‚Äôs so bad I‚Äôve even seen them get into arguments with other members. Idk what their ideologies actually are since they‚Äôre so conflicting but it gives big cult vibes. TLDR fuck those guys
Yeah fr they were using rifled cannons with impact shells in the 1800‚Äôs which puts these guys into perspective
You can find your answers a lot more easily with AI and the information is typically correct, especially with newer models.
Forgot history started only the day Hamas attacked
Fuck Hamas
Sure hamas deserves everything that's coming to them, but killing thousands of Gazans just creates more foot soldiers for hamas...
Yes, all of that is true but look at all of what is happening in regards to misinformation.  Palestinians, Hamas and Israel - all of them lie and try to spin everything to paint a narrative.From beheading babies to the hospital explosion. Don't get angry when someone is trying to stay objective even though it might come off as fucked up.
Basically that is the whole story. Yes
Praying for all the soldiers‚Ä¶ may you all come back. Going to be a rough urban fight unfortunately
Exactly the level of hypocrisy, racism and the double two faced standards with these westerners is disgusting, they want the people of Palestine not to resist so they can kill them off and steal their country just like they did to the Native Americans and the Native Australians then go on to talk about human rights and freedom.
Parking lot strategy is in effect.
You know Buddhists are genocidal too?  [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya\_people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rohingya_people)&gt;Probes by the UN have found evidence of increasing incitement of hatred and religious intolerance by "ultra-nationalist Buddhists" against Rohingyas while the Myanmar security forces have been conducting "[summary executions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summary_execution), enforced disappearances, arbitrary arrests and detentions, torture and ill-treatment, and [forced labour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unfree_labor)" against the community.
Pogrom itself is a Russian word giving some indication of the history there. More specifically there was a [pogrom in Makhachkala](https://brill.com/previewpdf/journals/spsr/36/1/article-p42_2.xml) in 1926. Details are minimal so unable to comment on the relative severity
That is an awesome photo! ü§©
How eloquent
So if Ukraine killed 1200 civilians you would support the  10k civilians intentionally killed by Russia with genocidal intent and rhetoric, mass rape and mass murder in places like Bucha, destroying civilian infrastructure to deprive civilians of heating in winter etc.? ü§°ü§°ü§°
you‚Äôre a fucking idiot
Dang, it's actually all 4 crowns of the Austro-Hungarian Empire.
Okay. But can they get a passport or not? If they're not a state then what does that make them? Because from the way you describe it, it sounds like they're administrated by Israel, but they aren't part of Israel, and since they're not a state they don't have a government to guarantee their rights? Am I understanding this correctly?
So 3,300 children have to die?  All they want is to grow up with family and people around them, but they don't get the chance to.  Same with the 1400 Israelis that died.  You are justifying genocide and colonialism because a far-right government told you that their the good guys.  You're literally going to listen to a prime minister holocaust revisionist?  https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/21/netanyahu-under-fire-for-palestinian-grand-mufti-holocaust-claimAlso, what about the 220 hostages that hamas captured?  They, along with 100s of nationals, news crews, and UN folks that are most likely in Gaza right now?  At least some of them have been killed after a week of bombing.  Nothing for the people attempting humanitarian work?  How about the aid that was supposed to go into Gaza?
Who are the FSA and SAA?
Unfortunately this wouldn‚Äôt have happened if the government of Gaza actually cared more about their citizens alive than dead
As a Black person I find Black Hebrew Israelites' crazy talk to be almost insufferable at the cookout. They're operating on so many misunderstandings about basic stuff that's so easy to research, it's embarrassing.
Bingo!
You think you can stop me from jumping straight into the human meat grinder that is war?!
Didn't nazis chant this type of propaganda?
It would be more like if California went to war with Tiajuana after tiajuana broke into their society and murdered, raped or kidnapped everyone in San Diego while many of Mexican decent danced in the street and celebrated these deaths. Then everyone got upset that California chose to retaliate for the deadliest attack in their history.
It's Maglan, so no tanks. Probably one of their fancy new toys like the laser guided accurate mortar thingy.
I don‚Äôt know. Too many. Fewer than Hamas claims. When millions of people take what Hamas says as the truth, you end up with blood libel episodes like what happened when the IDF was blamed for the hospital explosion. Mobs attempt to overtake embassies, throw Molotov cocktails at synagogues, riot at Dagestan airports looking for Jews to lynch‚Ä¶
You don‚Äôt have to make up some bullshit scenario to justify how you feel. Just use the facts. Your scenario has literally nothing to do with Israel/ Hamas.
Could have been a failed detonation of a primary charge.
I'm ready to volunteer to go to Mars now.
The sense is stop being cowards, go and protest and  send every Hamas member you know to the idf and give them their hostages.. oh wait.. they support Hamas .. oh well. War is war is war, and this one didn't start very well, I've lost 12 friends in the festival and was there myself, we just came to dance and do some drugs/drink.. after what I've seen i don't give a single speck of shit , we were not combatants , we were young people with kids that got slaughtered by "freedom fighters" I swear you Gaza supporters are plain hypocrites
They very much are.
Yes, it is horrible but with your mentality Israel could say that on 7th Hamas killed 50 million Jews and if you would question it, you would be "the worst kind of person".If you wanna virtue signal and be emotional, it's okay but don't expect everyone to not be adult.
I'm not familiar with these things, but the simplest of radio triggers would probably interpret the loud/broad jamming signal as the signal to fire? Cell phone triggers are probably more expensive and harder to time with whatever garbage infrastructure they have.  This blast doesn't look like an IED though, unless they 100% don't know what they're doing
LMAO, the HRW and Amnesty International are not just some ‚Äúrandom organizations‚Äù bossman
I know it‚Äôs unbelievable the real numbers are much higher
I wish IDF would post these in english, because a lot people missing context.
lmao, the phone you're using to write this comment is probably rocking a qualcomm modem R&amp;D'd in Israel
Anything that isn't anti-jewish gets harsh treatment on a lot of subs.
&gt;They've had almost two weeks of warningsNo they didn't, the warnings came until 13th October
Who cares what some random organizations says? Both HRW and AI have made plenty of idiotic statements in the past not based on any evidence.
Please don't spread misinformation that's highly irresponsible. You probably didn't mean it but you should certainly learn more about the situation in the west bank.
How do you think Israel should have responded when 1400 people got murdered, 200+ got kidnapped and the people that did all of this are constantly shooting rockets at them?
All things aside, if Z4 was put in the motion when discussed, we would be seriously fucked up state now.Good thing Serbian leadership was dumb enough to reject it.
as tongue in cheek as this may be, I kinda think you're right
Nailed it.
FYI, hamas leaders worth billions and they lived in luxury.
How many civilians do you think have been killed? Will you believe Israel instead?
Still can't get that hand out being a white guy......
zeppelin is still a company?????
The dildo of consequences rarely arrives lubed, but often with explosions.
You just explained the hell of fighting a guerilla, while the world tells you to ''spare the civilians''... Not saying the IDF should shoot everywhere, but we see how dumb that statement sounds.
are you braindead? that‚Äôs the exact same situation of ‚Äúhuman shields‚Äù lmaoooo. y‚Äôall cannot be real people.
Definitions exist. HRW and Amnesty International both agree that Israel is an Apartheid state. History speaks for itself.
&gt;Being Canadian and a Filipino mean I'm expected to commit war crimes that'll be recorded for posterity.Now tell me you are serving in the Australian Special Forces and the picture is complete
You are not wrong tho since the current Ukrainian president and prime minister are both Jewish
&gt;bombing random residential buildingsok
One question to shock your narrative for a bit.Where does the "Jenin brigade", a branch of the Islamic jihad, resides and acts from?Bonus question: how many terror attacks innocent civilians has suffered from the west bank?:)
70.000-80.000 soldiers. Lightly armed and scattered across the globe.Israel and Hamas will just laugh in their face and continue the fight
False equivalency
Cool now show them being fucking disintegrated
Good eye!
Everything is a genocide to people like you.
1) they do arrest settlers sometimes (not as often as they should).2) there are Hamas in the West Bank, but soon enough you will be right. 3) they have plenty of reason to be there. Look at the West Bank videos from the last 3 weeks or CNN.
You don't need fuel. All you have to do is BELIEVE
Hey, this sub is for making me horny over multi-billion dollar weapons of mass destruction with tits. NOT for making me horny over war criminals with a K-mart budget.
Stop with you BS outrage. This was by design. Palestinians wanted an over reaction by killing 1400 Israelis. They got their over reaction.
You‚Äôre a defender of an apartheid state and the genocide of Palestinians(which are mostly CHILDREN). Your mask came off a long time ago, and now you‚Äôre here projecting that onto me LOL. You wouldn‚Äôt know anti-semitism if it slapped you in the face. Being anti-Israel or anti-zionist isn‚Äôt anti-semitic. Many Jews are anti-Israel and anti-zionists. Get a fucking grip.
They likely won't. The thing with Israels strategic position is that it can dish out an ungodly amount of pain in a very short time frame, but it lacks the population to sustain a protracted conflict. They probably could march into Beirut (or Damascus), but then they could only raze it to the ground, not hold it for a long time against a sustained insurgency.This dynamic explains a lot about this conflict, by the way .This is why they are so aggressive - every conflict they do not win quickly and decisively is a strategic disaster.  Their stakes are way higher since they face genocide,  namely the kind of genocide where armed people go from door to door to rape and murder everyone inside until nothing remains, not the kind of genocide where your population doubles in a few decades. One loss and it's all over. At the same time, their enemies do not stare in the same abyss. They can lose decisively, rebuild, and try again ten years later.
That‚Äôs the full story ?
well so far they did hid in the tunnels, but let's just say that in the areas that the IDF control, they either die in the tunnels, or die when they run out.
Weapons have advanced but 15 aircraft carries, 6 battleships, 5 cruisers, and 10 destroyers pounding one island for three days does indicate how well a fortified bunker can sustain bombardment.
Russia and China must be appeased so UN won't fall apart, plus they are security council members. But Israel? Half the world hates the jews so it is fine.
thanks
Looking to murder Jews while carrying the Palestinian flag, yes this isn't particularly surprising at this point.
Wrong on so many levels.1) that's true there's been settler terrorism, and that's condemned in Israel from both right and left, and there's a justice system and police who addresses themin the west bank there's administrative detention which doesn't require trial and lawyer(which enforced on both Jews and Arabs) , and it's a common thing in many democracies, and normal detention that in the end they go up in military court because legally they can't be tried in a civilian court(for Arabs) , as the sovereign power is the army and not the state. (the terror the settlers do is a drop in the Arab terrorism that comes from the west bank, but it still doesn't justify it)2) Idf detains only people who are linked and belong to the Islamic jihad, hamas, and terrorists that doesn't belong to those 2 main terror organisation who has intention to harm both civilians and soldiers in Israel, as Israel suffer from terror attacks regularly from the west bank. It's a fact that hamas and Islamic jihad has people in the west bank (aka Jenin brigades), hamas is actively working on inciting people in the west bank to go kill innocents (not even talking about the 'slay for pay' of the PLA) , there're numerous terror attacks from the west bank residents on innocent civilians every year, the most recent one I remember is the "dee family", which only the father of the family has left alive. stop spewing nonsense, and don't act like you care about human rights while totally ignoring half of the story and making it as like it doesn't exist. Israel will still do whatever it needs to ensure safety of innocent, and deter terrorism. (and don't exaggerate in the numbers of the arrests lol, the hospital incident all over again)
Alright, let's say they inflate the number 2x. So it's 4,000 civilians, many of which are children dead.That's okay?How about 2,000. What is an acceptable number of civilians and children to bomb to death?
So if someone takes your mother hostage, and the police decide to gun both of them down instead of negotiating, that‚Äôs okay to you? Are you insane? This ‚Äúhuman shields‚Äù argument is ridiculous and immoral.
BTW the birth control was prescribed under false pretense.
let‚Äôs just say, i‚Äôm not seeing any women in the crowd. i think it‚Äôs more than just ‚Äúpeople‚Äù
Is this looney toons wtf?
why they get to evacuate when those at the music fest didn't? ye let's play the blame game, except this time it's the end it all
My guy they will STILL beat, rape, and execute your ass üíÄ
What medieval shit is this.
The last 20 years of Gaza and the West Bank is summed up in this one video.
Gaza has 1/3rd the population density of the 5 boroughs of NYC.
That‚Äôs not true at all, why are you weirdos constantly just lying??? Israel has *no excuse* to be in the West Bank at all. History will tell the true story and it will not treat people like you well.
Your headline left something off: according to Hamas
I'm not sure that's a good idea. For multiple reasonsEdit: I guess the point is, a proportional response is only one made in regards to something that has actually happened, not something someone wishes could happen.
If they were ‚Äúarresting terrorists‚Äù then they would be arresting the Israeli settler terrorists that are illegally in the west bank. There is no Hamas in the west bank they have zero reason to be there.
He has created a new sport: plane fencing
arresting terrorists, something the PA police aren't capable of
It's also collective punishment and a war crime to do so if this is the point - literally the textbook definition of terrorism actually to kill civilians to send a message. This is the sort of thing a country should be sanctioned to hell for. The problem is they're aided and abetted by the west at large - and people wonder why the global south has no trust in the west, or thinks they're hypocrites when they cry uncle about one human rights disaster while completely ignoring another.
They're right. You're being awful here. Multiple reputable sources and NGOs have confirmed that they've audited the Health Ministry's figures several times and they're always close to the actual number. They're even publishing names. Stop trying to muddy the water and downplay mass murder.
&gt; Evacuated where exactly?They were told two weeks ago to go to the south of the strip, the IDF offensive is focused on the north. &gt; There is no food,water,electricity,phone or internet.They really should have thought about this before massacring 1400 israeli civiliansactions have consequences.
So many animals and terrorist in Gaza. Only animals/terrorist died in Gaza. Israel in the right way.#free Israel
The ammo depots are under civilian buildings, which is a war crime. They then hit these ammo depots while destroying the building in collateral damage. Civilians dying is a tragedy but it is hamas‚Äô fault for using those civilians as a meat shield.
Wait till they get rpgs...
Christ no wonder Assad won
Netanyahu has really anti war agenda, he will never start a war unless he forced to and even then all his moves will be to try to get ceasefire, Hamas and Hezbollah know him for many years taking advantaged of this agenda and playing it to theirs side
Now lets flood the tunnels
Czech minister of defense posted on Twitter that we should leave UN over this decision, so she's definitely salty about only 14 countries having this stance.
Or they could use precision strikes and not bring down entire buildings
It wasn't a vaccination. They had doctors institutionally prescribe birth control to Ethiopian jews. What I just said was fact. What I am about to say is something I'm like 80% sure of, but unwilling to stake any claim to the veracity of.I'm pretty sure they only stopped doing it because the Ethiopian communities realized their birth rated were wildly low and caught on to the fact that something fishy was going on.
"Did you know Israel war is illegal?" With the fucking female TTS voice in the EU Parlement.
Except israel punched first and second and third, but no one reported on it.Then Hamas went on the offensive and the media came and said "wow look at this totally unprovoked attack! This attack happened in a vacuum! Israel has a right to defense!"
Imperial Japan was incredibly brutal and committed some of the worst atrocities of ww2. They got off lightly fighting the Allies compared to what their army did.
HUH so here we are categorizing ethnic groups by their behaviors.........................................................................................................................................................................
People's true colors keep coming out.
And then giving Bibi the Boot, and take a gun to any golden parachute he might try to pull, for the crime of FUNDING Hamas in the first place
Admiral Nelson just called, he wants his cannon from HMS Victory back ASAP
Weapons have advanced in 80 years. Israel uses bunker busters.
Evacuated where exactly? Borders are closed. Khan Younis and roads leading to it are heavily bombed. There is no food,water,electricity,phone or internet.
I prefer this one."When I was a kid, I always suspected some adults weren't that smart, but I didn't realize the situation was THIS bad."
Islam is a disease!
That, and we weren‚Äôt even looking in the right country for some of fhem
Maybe read why: the resolution did not condemn Hamas action and failed to declare them a terrorist organisation. Proud of my country, shame on UN!
What is IDF doing there?
They know it was coming and was told by the IDF to evacuate, they should have listened
Wow western news outlets were right this whole time!! They are all terrorists!    /s
Ah yes the "palestinian health ministry". Here is a question: Who runs the palestinian health ministry?
When was the last time a war had a right side and a wrong side... and who was on the right side... and the one before that..?
Why would the Israelis want to be live-streamed when preforming a raid, not wanting to give their enemies an advantage
Look at the amount of violent men you get, when they take away womans rights, indoctrinate entire towns with radical religion and then feed them propaganda. Those people are more backwards than anything.
Hvala bogu ne≈°to na≈°a vlada radi ne≈°to korisno
Gaza needs to overthrow hamas
Religion is the worst thing that could of ever happened
Nah mate, this definitely woke something in me.
The problem is not tunnels. The problem is that Gaza is half populated by children. You can't just kill all the kids but if you don't kill them even if you killed every adult Hamas would return in a few years. It's the same issue we faced in Afghanistan. Only permanent occupation with a promise of future citizenship would destroy Hamas but no way will Israel do that.
Except no civilians are safe here
You're right, it is insane. Simply saying "inshallah" and staying put in an active warzone, with your kids no less, is absolutely insane. They've had almost two weeks of warnings to go a few miles south to the safe zone of the southern Gaza Strip. Only a horrible person or an absolutely brainwashed zealot would knowingly put their children in this position. It's pathetically sad.
...by bombing them?
Russia: The Mississippi of EuropeDagestan: The Alabama of Russia.
Bro fuck off, fuck the guy in this video and fuck youYou and him are cut from the same judgey piece of shit cloth, your just to ignorant or hateful to realize it.
So your reaction to a dumbass guy judging a whole group of people based on a nonsense view is to judge a whole group of people based on your nonsense view that this guy represents all or most Jews?The Jewish faiths/groups like all faiths has toxic people but they don‚Äôt represent all Jewish people.Pretty sure most Jewish and non Jewish people do have morals and are human, so while the guy in this video is wrong your definitely wrong as well.
Nah most of the Jews are busy trying to get by or having a family or what shawarma will they eat this evening, imagine that.. people with normal lives .. shame on them
It's not as binary of an answer as israel bad palestine good, as much as the human mind hates being not conclusive it is a variable, not-so-clear situation, the hamas attacked israel and killed citizens, so i understand israel's anger, but at the same time israel was also practicing virtually no regard for civilians in gaza and effectively carpet bombed the whole place.This is bad not only in terms of morality, but also practicality, if anything is to be learned from 30+ years of the biggest most fiercest, most richest states fighting islamic insurgents, it's that the more civilians and or civilian infrastructure you destroy and the more you raid their houses and blow their shit up, the more passion they will have to sign up to be your enemy.Not that them being the enemy is justified, but you have to think about it from their perspective, what they see is a foreign force invading their land and their homes being blown apart, friends/family killed etc, they are going to sign up for that shit.
P: Sir, they‚Äôre using their own civilians as meat shields. G: By god. That means we have to surrender and let them genocide us. What a brilliant and humanitarian tactic.
Godspeed
I was scrolling through Reddit to forget about the racing incident
Where Kanye
Reminds me of Iwo Jima. Navy pounded the the island for days, but the Japanese were safe in their caves and tunnels.
they let hamas punch first to justify the genocide on the palestinian.
Being used as a human shield does have the tendency to do that to a child
I mean you sound pretty pro rape here tbh, saying that‚Äôs just what happens in war. Definitely seems like you are downplaying or dismissing it. Rape is obviously unacceptable war or no war. You go far enough back and rape was a part of everyday life during peace, doesn‚Äôt make it okay today.im not sure what you actually hoped to accomplish with your comment, cause I‚Äôm pretty sure it wasn‚Äôt to defend rape right?
At first I was confused but idk if Id rather have a bomb just level the building or see these guys lob a fucking bomb through my wall and it's paints the inside of the building with me and all my buddies.
Because the ceasefire call didn't call for the release of the hostages
Crazy shit, Football is on on Sundays lets drink beer and ignore the world around us.
Sir, we haven't carried those since '83
Was. Never changes.
Israel doesn't exactly need to rebuild. It's not like they lost any infrastructure.
There are Neo Nazis group there tho.
The first one made me think of [killdozer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZbG9i1oGPA) from back in 2004.
Ironically these black hebrew Israelites would be treated like shit and face racism from Israelies.
as long as you‚Äôre paying for it bro
Note that Hamas is not in the West Bank. Israel locked it down anyway, Israeli settlers murdered some Palestinians that had nothing to do with Hamas or Gaza, and leaflets were dropped telling every Palestinian to flee before the new nakba wiped them all out.Oh, and Israeli forces began arresting random civilians en masse. About 100 per day. For unknown reasons. They get no attorney and no trial. No one knows why they've been rounding them up or what they're doing with all of them.It's an all around fucked up situation that can't be justified by the usual talking points. Anyone defending Israel in the West Bank right now necessarily is just being anti-Palestinian and anti-human rights because horrible things are being done to civilians there without any connection to Gaza other than a shared nationality.
Sure ya did. Maybe you shouldn't ask a generative text AI questions about history. Maybe you should read a book instead
Arrrr load the cannons Pirates
Bullshit.
For reference: Jenin is a city in the West Bank.Hamas is not in the West Bank.
Those Black Hebrew Israelites are notoriously horrible people that scream shit at people in public all the time, no matter what's going on in the world, fuck them.
PALESTINIAN used ROCK!Its' not very effective.....
‚ÄúEngaging‚Äù sounds better than ‚ÄúSlaughtering‚Äù
Yeah that‚Äôs fair
Probably spike or hellfire missiles.
But Reuters has a good reputation. And they're sourcing the UN, and WHO themselves who say that the numbers are broadly correct at least.
How dare they throw rocks at the people kicking them out of their homes and taking over their country. Not to mention bombing the shit out of them.
Nah, the UN and all the human rights groups have been telling you for weeks why it's not acceptable to tell civilians to just leave so you can bomb their homes and seize their land, even as you bomb their homes and shelters and evacuation routes, and even as you cut the water and power supply.You don't get to say, "it's just war" as if war crimes don't exist. They objectively do and Israel is committing them with reckless abandon. Which is why there are hundreds of thousands of people protesting in cities all over the planet and why multiple committees and leaders in the UN have condemned Israel for its conduct over the past 3 weeks The rules and the law are clear and it is effortless to apply them to Israel's actions and consider whether it's violating human rights or not. It clearly is. Nothing Hamas or its neighbors changes that, and them declaring war before massacring civilians doesn't magically make mass murder of civilians not a significant war crime.Hope this helped. No one should have to spoonfeed you this information but your point of view is disgustingly common on this sub. If everyone thought like you we would still be in the Dark Ages and the Nuremberg Trials never would have happened because "It's just war."
Yeah that was like a toe popper
Gross
‚ÄúTheir is no Hamas in the West Bank why is there no peace‚Äù

I didn‚Äôt say any of that. I said those numbers aren‚Äôt reliable and they aren‚Äôt. Why is me being truthful threatening enough that you feel you need to lie in an attempt to belittle me?
It was edging its fuse too long

I have no idea.
That was a rhetorical question
I think Israel sold the lasers on eBay a couple of years ago. Pretty sure they're North Korean space lasers now. Them or Jamaica.
Ceasefire would set a bad precedent for all terrorists that you can do oct 7th and be fine.Death to Hamas i say
Your interests are understandable, but this is the internet.
They only have Hamas to blame for this. It is a real shame that their own leadership has put them in such horrible danger.#freeGazaFromHamas
It's like one step up from a spud gun... A trebuchet would have more effect
Hm. Warmongering it may be, but is it entirely wrong if I also want to glass the Saudis for being the unresolved *business* from 2001? Cause I think since they helped Osama do his naughty business, that we should have gutted the Arabian peninsula, and set up the oil fields over top of U-234 glass dunes.The Iranians get it for being the other half of the problem for regional stability.
They still have the Jewish space lasers, right? They could technically blow up the sun if they really wanted to.Unlike North Korea, but at least they tried.
Fucking entire family trees are being extinguished and all you can say is, "Show me the proof?"  You're literally the worst kind of person
So what are they going to do? Slaughter every one on board?
I'm totally convinced that the "Yes vote" by the austrian representative of the UN was actually an accident. The austrian political system is so chaotic right now that he was just confused and didn't knew that actual position for the conflict. Austria had three different Chancellors in one election period, the "Weimar Republik" would be proud. And recently, the election of the second largest party leader had to be annulled because they had a mistake in their excel sheet with the votes and nobody bothered to check before announcing the outcome.Actually, it might be time again for Germany to put Austria again under German administration
Israel doesn't have any interest in good relations with Palestinians. They are neutralizing the threat. And Biden is making it clear that the united states supports this course of action
Another 4 kids killed congrats Israel!
Ok, son. Sure, sure.
This is not genocide. It‚Äôs a brutal war, but it‚Äôs not genocide.
Hm I see the US voted against: So I reiterate u/Mood2016‚Äôs point of order UN.**How do you plan to enforce it?**
It's really weird, when the Ukraine war started, everyone was ok with people saying things against Russia, but then this war starts and I get banned from two subs for saying we should make Hamas look like the scene from Halo.
Hitler would love this shit current day, wtf is happening.
Just be careful, if they have black, red, and white paint we might need to have the raptors kindly escort them back!/J
Or I can think critically?
Not that I don‚Äôt sympathize with the Palestinian tragedy, but I can write 8,000 names on a piece of paper. Did you fall for the hospital bombing lie, as well?
WTF?
I need to know. *What was poland‚Äôs vote?*
One third of the allegations on the video are inaccurate and another third are embellished half-truths. (For instance, the reason Israel slows the import of aid trucks is because for decades Hamas and Islamic Jihad have fashioned weapons out of certain imports, and outside militias funnel weapons into Gaza through aid packages.)Also - just ‚Äútrying to make sense of the atrocities!‚Äù It just doesn‚Äôt make sense! No sense at all! Other than the fact that they killed 1,400 Israelis and are sworn to the destruction of the Jewish state and the expulsion and murder of Jews in the Middle East. But apart from that, it just doesn‚Äôt make sense!!!1!!
Ya those buddhists really need to chill out /s
Like I said - we lack the context here to know what happened. Generally speaking those guys like to fuck with everyone. If you‚Äôve ever spent a lot of time in nyc , you‚Äôll know it‚Äôs best to ignore them. They set up tables with really provocative things and try to rile people up.
So why are they having a whinge about Palestinian supporters?I‚Äôm legitimately confused
More than triggered, I've lost faith in humanity.
This is why it's a massive mistake for the West to support this
You  have fallen for the propaganda.
You mean the Israeli hasbara brigade?
leaving israel asap, and once you leave you can start working on leaving dagestan (which is easier)
*Turns up music*
I don't care what your religion is. Fuck your God, get a better hobby.
Start up those engines on that plane and give them full thrust, should send them back to the fucking dark ages to match where their head is at.
The Israeli military literally had major budget lines dedicated to funding islamic extremists as a counter weight to PLO and Fatah. You are factually incorrect in stating that Israel's occupation did not lead to Hamas. They directly contributed to Hamas.
Just drop a nuke on their stupid cube with that stone and start the day of judgement already.
There were comments deleted on a post of a guy getting hit by a car in New York.
They‚Äôre called the Palestinian Territories (Gaza &amp; West Bank) so it‚Äôs an autonomous territory. There is no internationally recognized Palestinian country. Part of it is autonomously governed by the PA as the other poster commented and the other part of it is under Israeli military control, according to the IDF, to contain and prevent militant activity. The PA has accepted Israeli control of those areas, but not happily.
I know bricklayers that can repair that wall faster than they can damage
Wtf is the driver listening to? Arabic music? You know, cause he‚Äôs Arab.
What the fuck is a Black Hebrew Israelie? A black jew?   Live in Harlem we do?  Freed US slaves going away from Jesus.  Bullshit.
Just nuke the peninsular
You never felt the warmth of a 120mm smooth bore barrel as you penetrate it and caress it as it blooms its warm ashy cloud post evacuation.
Unfortunately they suffer under the actions of their government (Hamas) who still has the majority of support in Palestine. Also they are beeing warned before the strikes and told to go south for their own protection
Thats what is so stupid about the Hamas plan. Clearly they were not Vibing with Bibi and to an extent, he is the final bag holder for alot of these issues. But by God they just gave him so much ammo for public support in glassing the Gaza.
This country is full of racists who love to involve race and religion in everything, so antisemitism is very well expected here, but there is hilarious hypocrisy. They love their Palestinian brother but absolutely despise Rohingya refugees.
Not to be confused with black Israeli Ethiopian jews, who are usually less racist.
*Kanye West has entered the chat*Seriously though, I'd be keeping an even stronger eye on him.
It is propaganda in a sense, but it's not "fake information" since they didn't say anything that is factually untrue.
Best i can offer is a few GBU on a mortar site.
'BMX'd in the face'   Not a term you hear every day is it
They're in D.C. too! They mostly congregate and give hate speeches in Washington D.C.'s Chinatown, which, contrary to implications around its name, has actually very few Chinese people now.
It's only the beginning. With the lack of food, power , medicines and shelters, the number will spike.   My hearts goes out to all the orphans caused by this war. They will never get hugs, and kisses from their parents. Life for them will never be the same.
No you‚Äôre just triggered
I miss my Kaleidoscope doing this
Yes, but Israel is the problem. /S
Ah shit of a situation as this is, that ceiling has actually been put together nicely
If you speed this up, it looks like a scene from World War Z
Which comments are being removed? Pro Palestinian?
Fucking humans‚Ä¶ no wonder I don‚Äôt fit in.
Your first point "HAMAS and its more extreme cousins are well adept at hiding within the 2m+ population of the Gaza strip" is why Israel is in a bit of a lose lose situation as far as perception in the world goes because even if it attacks Hamas targets both Hamas and normal uninvolved citizens are added to the same death toll. Surely Gazans as a whole are suffering lot in this war but the Hamas ministry of health being the source of death tolls is a bit absurd.
Imagine thinking that you can actually identify over 6000 dead in a week... (hell, they identified the "500" people killed in the hospital almost instantly).Not to mention the video of "dead bodies" where one of them accidentally moves her head...Don't get me wrong, I truly hope the civilian casualties will be at the bare minimum that is humanly possible (when Hamas actively tries to keep civilians from evacuating and turning their homes into military targets).
&gt; Croatia&gt; Allies of IsraelHuh?
I hate this war so much. I love planes, but this just puts a sour taste in my mouth. People are on here unironically wanting to flatten Gaza and just indiscriminately kill anyone and everyone. We could criticize Russia for this sh*t, but suddenly the shoe is on the other foot so it's all different.
wait this isn‚Äôt formuladank
Fuck the Israel√≠ government. Fuck Hamas Fuck this this whole situation.
I don‚Äôt understand how they can stand behind a country that has forcibly sterilized black Jews living in Israel. Especially when you got other is Israelis denouncing what The country is doing.
No, just talking about the BI
Sorry you went through that. They become so brainwashed.
Areas A and B are under civil control of the "Palestinian authority", it has some attributes of a country such as a passport, but they lack key requirements a country needs, such as sovereignty and local coin.Basically an autonomy inside Israel, which isn't part of Israel legally (and no other country as Jordan gave it up), but under its control dating back to 1967, and parts of it are (Areas A and B) controlled by both PLA and Israel.
This aint the Rio Grand-eo... Across the lazy river
Terrorists
To paraphrase Stalin, "How many divisions does the ~~Pope~~ UN have?"
God i fucking hoping for that! Bomb Indonesia too!
What about the people who didn't do that, but still want a ceasefire?
&lt;&lt; ONE MILLION LIVES &gt;&gt;
After the Holocaust the least we can do is not ask questions about stuff like this. God wills it.
They are going to kill everyone. They've said as much. I can't ask the average Israeli to not be mad. This conflict is older than many of us, and to see October 7th's attack is devastating. We do not have to forgive Hamas to condemn Israel. This is absurd, these are innocent fucking people. A captive population. It'd be like if California went to war with Alcatraz. This has to stop.
There‚Äôs no way to tell at this point.
Rumor has it they‚Äôre still working on the left side of the wall to this day
Israel has tactical nukes, not strategic.They could delete military infrastructure, but not cities or the countryside.
It wasn't enough. Even Israeli officials agreed it wasn't enough. You can't move a million people, including children, the elderly, the sick and injured (common in a warzone), across miles without any support. Also, Israel bombed the evacuation routes to the south several times. They are also actively bombing the south, so what's the point of moving? Nowhere is safe.
&gt; Unless they get the US to nuke IranI don‚Äôt think Israel needs the US for that.
All fun and games until they realize none of them know how to fly
I think Israel is just really unpopular. It's not the UN bringing up those resolutions, it's the countries that participate in it. The UN is just a diplomatic platform.
I truthfully think it's the undermining of the caves that is causing a lot of the catastrophic collapse.
I'll try but I can't make any promises
"Israel's occupation created the conditions that led to Hamas" Strongly disagree. Have kurds ever killed thousands of innocents in a single attack against Turkey, including toddlers in a nunnery, livestreaming to the world to see? And they have literally been ethnic cleansed from the north of Syria (something the world didn't care, by the way). I don't think ever the fucking taliban did that. Only IS could claim that savagery. But at least they happily beheaded only adults. If Israel launched a atomic bomb, could you say "Hamas' attack created the conditions that led to the atomic bomb"? There is something messed up shit there in Hamas. But there is no determined line or destiny that they had to follow. They always could have chosen another way.
Let's not commit war crimes, please.
What's worse is why this kind of propaganda is spreading.  The video in the original post was created by Propaganda and Co. (you'll see that at the end of the video, it's not even hidden). The tagline of their channel is: " Tired of the propaganda so we started producing our own. watch, subscribe, and free your mind here". They're begging people on Twitter to watch their videos so they can monetize them and make money. Spreading fake information like these people are trying to weaponize and monetize hurts Palestinians because it makes anyone posting or repeating it look dishonest.  These people are just trying to cash in on the suffering of people by monetizing content.https://preview.redd.it/7gsr0q67h9xb1.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e58b025ff61418e728ccd2baaa9cfec8c8e77e37
I was going to type a response but that's better than anything I could type.
I think it's dependent on the context. We rebuilt Germany and  Japan, which I think turned out pretty good.
There was a 70% increase in Germany, why don't they go bomb them? Tf you on about are you trying to say zionists need to go kill civilians or they seem weak? America supplies Israel with 3b a year 100b + given to them so far. This is a massacre covered up by bs excuses like you have given. Muslims have been getting eradicated in Iraq and India why not stand up for all the civilians dying there? Wanna know why because you don't like Muslims that's all you have to say. You see how it's not about land? Let's also talk about how 47% of Palestine is kids. And you talking about Arab countries having declining Jewish populations? Are they eradicating them? Do they sit and bomb them just for the fuck of it so they can protect their faith?
We had red lasers integrated in our optics when I served in 2010. (IDF)
I'm going to help you understand why propaganda like this happens.  The video in the original post was created by Propaganda and Co. (you'll see that at the end of the video, it's not even hidden).

They're begging people on Twitter to watch their videos so they can monetize them and make money.  Spreading fake information like these people are trying to weaponize and monetize hurts Palestinians because it makes anyone posting or repeating it look dishonest.https://preview.redd.it/dp4c8zfag9xb1.png?width=610&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7478c96c6c5b71e2c821dd4d6e2e04dee64c93d5

We already have a ginsu hellfire
Being pro Israel and justifying genocide because you think the Jewish way of life is better. I want the irony to soak in. I‚Äôm not saying Jewish life isn‚Äôt better, but the irony is just magnificent. Also, why do you think the civilians are helping HAMAS? Do you have any awareness of what Israel has been doing to Palestine for the last several decades? Do you think they haven‚Äôt tried peace?
Who‚Äôs we? Fuck that bastard. At least he‚Äôs in hell now.
I mean tbf noone in the world deserves UN condemnations other than Israel. Like seriously it's not like there are countries in the Balkans, Middle East, Eastern Europe, Africa, South East Asia, East Asia, Central America, or South America whos human rights track records make Israel look like modern day Sweden.
Oh so it has autonomy, but it isn't a sovereign country? How does that work, does that mean they're citizens of Israel then? Wait if they're not a country does that mean they can't get a passport?&amp;#x200B;EDIT: I'm not sure why I'm being downvoted for asking if it's possible for Palestinian people to get passports.
Honestly, I think the outcome in Afghanistan was more strategic than anything else. The country is a mountain range. Insurgents have a gajillion places to hide. The US could control the cities, but no one was ever going to be able to secure those mountains.
You‚Äôre both stupidly, laughably, horrifyingly wrong. How bout that?
How many do you think have died?  Which source are you using?
Or maybe the falling bombs does it too
That...is a take. I mean, I want a ceasefire, but Israel invading Iran would be suicide. Like, Iran is a giant mountain range with 90 million people. Israel has 9 million people and is separated from Iran by two other countries. Unless they get the US to nuke Iran, a war would not go well. How would they even get troops over there?
All of your points are true. This video grossly ignores key details. Wtf is happening to this sub?
Hamas hasn't actually deleted Israel, so no.
I‚Äôve also heard about the rocket coming from HAMAS but what‚Äôs your credible source? Take what you‚Äôre learning with a grain of salt. What not biased credible source did you read that HAMAS isn‚Äôt letting people leave? From what I read Israel has bombed exit routes after telling people to flee. Egypt has closed borders, where do you expect them to flee to?

Hamas exerts control of the ministry. The Guardian has long been in the tank for the Palestinians. They don‚Äôt even pretend to be unbiased.
I now understand how 17th century forts were able to withstand months of continuous cannon fire.
Why is America so polarized over this?!? Why do people put so much passion into this when we could be focusing on the homeless and drug epidemic?
It‚Äôs not indiscriminate.
Absolutely. Use the best tool for the job. Many years ago I read an article about the 6 Day War, which had a lot of fun kills. In an interview with an Israeli pilot, the article claimed the pilots were taught to use their guns when possible (and put the pipper on the cockpit) because it was cheaper than a missile.
Si
Get in trouble how? Can you link me to an article?
You should start by reading about the "Oslo accords" to understand what's the west bank, it's sort of an autonomy, not a sovereign country.
I don‚Äôt live there now but I was born there and my family is from there
What are you talking about?All I said was it's not based on religion because the religions haven't changed. What changed was the Israeli siege and bombing of Palestinians. Otherwise every flight from Israel would have been getting the same treatment.How is that justifying anything? Did I say it's a good thing the they're doing this?
This is why you can't have nice things
You're American on American soil !
Wait, how do they kill the babies after they‚Äôre already decapitated? That‚Äôs what I want to know.
They're reliable. Here are some sources for you. https://amp.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/26/can-we-trust-casualty-figures-from-the-hamas-run-gaza-health-ministry&gt; Others say the ministry has a track record of reliable casualty figures and that it has fallen victim to the propaganda war as Israel seeks to minimise the consequences of its hundreds of bombing raids on Gaza.&gt; In the past, the US state department‚Äôs annual human rights report indirectly relied on the same ministry‚Äôs casualty figures in quoting UN statistics drawn from Palestinian data.https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/despite-bidens-doubts-humanitarian-agencies-consider-gaza-toll-reliable-2023-10-27/&gt; U.N. and other international agencies say there can be small discrepancies between the final casualty numbers and those reported by the Gaza health ministry straight after attacks, but that they broadly trust them.&gt; New York-based Human Rights Watch also says the casualty figures have generally been reliable, and that it has not found big discrepancies in its verification of past strikes on Gaza.https://theweek.com/defence/how-trustworthy-are-the-gaza-health-ministrys-casualty-numbers&gt; The Gaza casualty numbers come mostly from doctors who diligently count every body brought into struggling hospitals, then send the numbers on to the Health Ministry for tabulation, The Associated Press explained regarding the accuracy of the death count. And while Hamas exerts control over the ministry, it's partly funded and run by the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank ‚Äî a key Hamas rival ‚Äî and many of its civil servants predate Gaza's Hamas takeover. The United Nations and other international institutions and experts "say the Gaza ministry has long made a good-faith effort to account for the dead under the most difficult conditions," AP reported, and "in previous wars, the ministry's counts have held up to U.N. scrutiny, independent investigations and even Israel's tallies."
They need to take their ear home not here !
Oh, they are certainly not on their side.  They‚Äôre just not on the Palestinian‚Äôs side either.
Because it‚Äôll never happen. The US has been and will continue to be a secular country. Just because the speaker of the house wants to pander to evangelicals, that doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre living in Iran in 1978. I don‚Äôt support the idea obviously. Only 25% of the country is evangelical and that percentage is shrinking. How on earth do you imagine they‚Äôd be able to implement their vision of a Christian republic? That‚Äôs why this is fear mongering. It‚Äôs completely unrealistic to worry about the US becoming a theocracy. What you should be concerned about instead is the people on the streets of places like NYC and Berkley calling for Jihad and glory to the martyrs of Hamas. In the past decades, religious violence in this country has been almost exclusively perpetrated by the members of a certain religion that is NOT Christianity. And as someone who has Jewish relatives and Jewish friends I am far less worried about Christianity than the elements of the religion depicted in this post.
You don't need to be born in America to act like one and it doesn't change anything about the tremendous amount of psycho content coming from US, you take it bad like Karen's weren't a thing
Bro. You're not talking about ethnically Jewish. That is not a thing. You're talking about ethnically ASHKENAZI (Jewish). The Jews in North America are almost entirely this type so every just says Jewish. There's plenty of others, the largest other group being Sephardic (Arab)
Damn you should be careful cause it seems like they arent fans of that over there, good luck brother come to NY
Don't forget the Gaza Strip is the single most densely populated places on earth. And it's being indiscriminately bombs and shelled.
Or they have larger target areas on the Lebanon side and want to economize their supply of smaller ones for the operations they‚Äôre conducting in the Gaza Strip.Edit: but also what you‚Äôre seeing and attributing to the size of the bombs/missiles could be secondary detonations of something that was at the target. Like mortar rounds and rockets.

No one said they did. Also all Semitic tribes come from this ancient Eurasian genetic lineage. So it seams like you‚Äôre just trying to show everyone how big your PP is. Very unnecessary.
Is the West Bank a separate country to Israel? Is Israel in the West Bank with the permission of the government in the West Bank? If not, is there a specific issue with them trying to target an occupying army?
ur a robot
Yes it is and bombing civilians isn‚Äôt ok. But this is seen as existential to many Jews. If they don‚Äôt win this war they could be wiped off the planet. Just look at the declining Jewish population in Arab countries, or the massive protests across the world chanting things like ‚Äúfrom the river to the sea‚Äù. Or look at crime stats by the FBI. 51.4% of hate crimes in the US (the country with the second largest Jewish population) are against Jews and they only make up 2.4% of the total population. Hamas and many of their state and non state supporters don‚Äôt care about the civilians either. They care about killing Jews and destroying Israel. Acting like this is just about stealing land is insane.
So many disgusting comments here it‚Äôs fucking sad this many people are supporting so much death and destruction
Lol new gen nazis
Sorry I meant to say "they" not you, didn't mean to make that assumption. I was confused when you said "us republicans" but I guess you meant "US Republicans"&gt;The fear mongering part is acting like the US is on the brink of becoming a theocracy because there are republicans who want to make abortion illegal. I brought up women's rights as a single point, you are the one choosing to hyper focus on it while ignoring the rest. Also, despite what you may think, people's rights to bodily autonomy is very important to many. When the Republican Speaker of the house publicly declares his wishes to remake the country into a "Biblical Republic" we should all be worried. I keep quoting this and you don't seem to have a care about it.

Think of all the great and promising things that the good and intelligent people are doing now in science, health, medicine etc. It's a race between the smart and decent and the ignorant and caveman mentalities. Only way we'll survive is through the former.
People are waking up to the genocide and daily massacre of the Palestinians.Your rhetoric does not work anymore.
Because the context is that it's the equipment they brought? The rockets are fired from Gaza, not by the fighters that went for the attack. Mentioning rockets in that sentence would be as unnatural as saying "Israel's soldier were armed by guns, tanks, and the Iron Dome".
The point is well made, but I can't stand that delivery.
then they deserve each other and the consequences that relationship brings.
Those stupid usury laws mixed with blatant ostracization
Doing something might involve paperwork
lol wow
But let's be clear: a lengthy military occupation was not able to stabilize the situation, and led to a worse outcome than what preceded it. Well, at least for the civilians of both countries; the Israeli government prefers Hamas control as it allows them to make no concessions while continuing to expand control.There's nothing to suggest that the same approach, used again, would have a different outcome.
Specifically, [Bedouin tribes that have existed in the area of Israel for centuries.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedouin#Israel). The unit also has a mix of people from other indigenous ethnic/religious groups although the majority are bedouin. [Desert Reconnaisance Battalion (Unit 585)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desert_Reconnaissance_Battalion)Also worth mentioning is that they‚Äôre all volunteers, as they don‚Äôt face compulsory service like Israeli Jews do.
Correct, but Israel's occupation created the conditions that led to Hamas. Israel also directly assisted Hamas, and Netanyahu himself has emphasized that Hamas' control of Palestine is useful to him because it prevents meaningful peace. This assists him in keeping power but also accomplishes his fairly blatant goal of expanding Israel by further displacing Palestinians.

No. Strawman. You‚Äôre spreading inaccurate info provided by Gaza Ministry (Hamas). Me understanding that‚Äôs a bad source doesn‚Äôt mean I believe no civilians have been killed.
My god
It‚Äôs a proven fact that hamas has based under at least 2 hospitals
Pretty sure that was George Carlin.
Anyone find it weird on how many Black Lives Matter people were in this protest. Open your eyes people.
i thought optimum pride was filipino not malay
Every time a ceasefire occurs between Israel and Palestine, HAMAS just gears back up and starts the fighting again a few months laterIt goes like:HAMAS bombs Israel. Maybe 2 missiles hit Israel , while the rest kill more Gazans.Israel bombs them to hell. HAMAS begs for a ceasefire.Israel gives ceasefire. HAMAS takes the time to gear back up and starts bombing again a few months later Repeat.After what HAMAS did, there should be no quarter given.
You are literally making excuses for a pogrom.
No they aren‚Äôt but you are the one making this about land when it‚Äôs not that simple. Saying it‚Äôs people fighting because they‚Äôre land is being taken is severely misunderstanding the intentions behind the people that Israel is at war with.
ahh that makes sense, thanks for the clarification!

&gt; The death of a civilian is on the hands of both the killer and the person hiding behind themAre you just making international law and the conventions up? &gt;Hamas using civilians as human shields doesn't give israel the right to bomb indiscriminately.Except it isn't indiscriminate at all--  nor is it bombing.
Ukraine I'm fairly sure.Tons of Jewish folks from Russia that moved to Israel. Hardly anyone going the opposite direction I think.
It would be surprising if they weren't being covertly supported by some adversary intelligence service. They absolutely reek of front organization
Who gives a shit about hamas??? The same way I dont give a shit about the taliban or isis. Palestinians are not hamas the 3k kids killed are not part of hamas you ignoramus.

Israel has for weeks been leafleting and broadcasting that civilians should move southward to areas not being attacked whatsoever.it is not "madness" to fight terrorists like Hamas, it is quite logical.
I still got my custom planes and Chinese off-brand WW2 tanks and planes (also an Abrams) gathering dust on my shelves
Israel has existed for decades. Was the flight before Oct 7th swarmed like this one?If not, isn't it likely that this is a reaction to recent events since Israel has been Jewish, and Dagestanis have been Muslim since long before?
You‚Äôre misunderstanding the capabilities of Iron Dome.  It can be (and was) overwhelmed on October 7.  Specifics matter.
I mean Israel already holds the record for most condemnations by the UN. Might as well see how far they can run up the score.
Or the opposite. Dude in the car is jamming the button but the radio signal doesn't get through until the IDF vehicle is passed (and it's screaming radio stops drowning out the signal).
Who says I vote for republicans? Because I don‚Äôt. The fear mongering part is acting like the US is on the brink of becoming a theocracy because there are republicans who want to make abortion illegal. You simply cannot compare people actively looking to behead Jews to people who think abortion after the first trimester should be illegal‚Ä¶
Dagestan is majority Muslim so they don‚Äôt have to lone wolf their hatred of Jews.
Ignorance is believing Hamas will stop killing Jews if Israel gives them land.
If only we had fuel for more than one

If Joan of Arc is a summon in MegaTen, why not Adrian Carton de Wiart?
In good part the phenomena started with states in Europe, and quite a few Moslem jurisdictions, barring them from the main form of wealth building in middle ages --agricultural land ownership. This forced large portions of Jewish population into skilled labor, education level professions and brain power based vocations.

Do you have a source for this? I‚Äôm Dagestani Jewish and my parents and grandparents lived peaceful lives growing up alongside a majority-Muslim population. Not saying you‚Äôre BSing, but I‚Äôm going to need to see some proof.
Not exactly. When they pulled out, the goverment was Al-Fatah. Hamas took over Gaza after a civil war.
I have seen reports saying that the rockes fired since 2001 only killed 69 people , 36000 rockets i think in total, and 69 only died .
Remember. No Russian.
&gt;Why not Palestine?Because, refugee-led cells of Palestinian militant groups tried to coup both Jordan and Lebanon. Plus a lot of Arab countries had problems with Palestinian suicide bombers, especially Egypt. Thus, they aren't worth the risk of the violence they bring for cheap labor in the eyes of many Arab countries.
No really. They make a lot of claims over facebook, yihad and all that, and then the people go to another page. Egypt has closed their borders. No country has promised to help the palestinians. Even Iran has said that there will be a lot of palestinians deaths, and that's a price they are willing to pay
Context matters. Iin the context of the middle East Israel is secular. This war is not about religion. It is about territory. Yes religion, nationalism, values, can be real or claimed factors in territorial wars, but they are still about territory.
yeh when the PLO was still in power there. The problem was they kept stalling out aid and then bibi shows up shuts down the two state solution plans all together. The problem is PLO is still in control of west bank and how Israel return the favor of peace is illegally settle it.

Power vacuums create the worst warlords.  The trouble with suddenly deoccupying a region is that the sharpest tongue and the bloodiest sword will be in charge.
But it's not misinformation since what they're saying is factually true? The video didn't say all civilians were killed by Israel, only some of them.
Have the Palestinian authorities or people ever agreed to a pathway to independence in which they recognize the State of Israel and live alongside them, and the Jewish people, in peace?
Haven‚Äôt you seen, doing anything to people throwing rocks at you is a war crime.

&gt;plastic actionBrother this is a pogrom.
Well allegedly they did call in the Russian National Guard. It's true that Russia has a long sordid history of anti-semitism, I always am surprised if Jews choose to live there. Usually they flee FROM Russia, long before all this. In fact after some of the pogroms there I think many ended up in Israel. Mila Kunis and her family came here from Russia, I think.
Faster than a bulldozer and all paid for by the American taxpayer. I wish this would end. At this point I can only hope some people end up in a war crime tribunal.
Don‚Äôt forget based Czechia, one of the first countries to supply military aid to Israel all the way back in 1948
The fact that it is 8000 civilians and 0 militants is telling af
Just an inchident
Sounds like you aren‚Äôt willing then.
The Jews were there first. They crossed the Red Sea out of Egypt  into what was called Judea the later The Roman‚Äôs changed it to Palestine then given back to the Jews in 1948. Then they won a couple wars and kept the land to build buffers
It's like when Israel gave Northern Gaza a 24 hour warning that they were going to invade. The UN said 24 hours isn't enough. Bitch, what other country gives a warning? Other countries may implement policies to reduce collateral damage (such as when the USA banned .50 cal in urban environments for Iraq) or allow civilians to flee/set up a humanitarian corridor especially in cases where they're not facing a great deal of asymmetrical warfare. But can anyone else find an example of a country issuing a warning of invasion that wasn't a fear tactic? And Israel still delayed the ground invasion.
"we will watch your career with great interest"
That‚Äôs cause they hold their opinions from a distance. As soon as they realise Hamas ideology is reprehensible they‚Äôll turn their backs on the whole movement. Yes there are innocents in Palestine. But theyre not who these protestors are defending unfortunately.
Yes I fully agree. *But* there are other systems that do the same thing, and doesn‚Äôt create radicals that are willing to kill people for their beliefs. And at this point can we really say ‚Äúoh it‚Äôs just a few bad apples‚Äù when religious violence has been constant since people started recording history? It‚Äôs a given in every major religion that someone is going to be motivated by their religion to do others harm, which is not at all worth the benefits.
That would make the Arabs look pretty silly. They've been claiming to have each others back.
I think their enthusiasm will fade as their hand puppets wither and die . China , Russia and Iran all to gutless for direct involvement again . We want we want he says . He ain‚Äôt gonna get squat .
I have family in Israel, and they told me for the first time in over 30 years the government‚Äôs political parties have pushed aside their differences and unified into a war government for the sole purpose of exterminating Hamas and ensuring any Hamas militant is killed by any and all means regardless of methods and with extreme prejudice. There was a video I saw posted of a Hamas terrorist going into peoples homes and killing them point blank and laughing. Then was found by an IDF soldier and was shot with the bastard then groveling and pleading for mercy when approached but the IDF soldier had none to spare and the terrorist was then gunned down mercilessly. Israel‚Äôs gloves are off. They do NOT give a shit about other peoples sheltered opinions anymore. All they care about is the support of their main allies, and the people who supply their ability to defend themselves, namely the United States; and with the majority of America (thank God) being in support of Israel‚Äîis the reason why Israel doesn‚Äôt give a shit about the rest of the world‚Äôs opinion and told them to fuck off.

So you just believe that no civilians have been killed? Must be an easy way to justify what‚Äôs being done.How many do you believe have been killed? 0? 10? 100? 1000? What is an acceptable number of dead children for you?International agencies, including the United Nations and the World Health Organization (WHO), report figures provided by the Gaza ministry.The WHO last week said: ‚ÄúWe believe that the numbers being reported in Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territories‚Ä¶may not be perfectly accurate on a minute-to-minute basis but they grossly reflect the level of death and injury on both sides of that conflict.‚ÄùThe US is an ally in this genocide so naturally they will partake in efforts to discredit and deflect from what‚Äôs taking place.
What music festival did the IDF raid? What part of Gaza did the IDF go door to door slaughtering civilians in their homes and driving their cars? When did the IDF video themselves kill a civilian and then send that video to the person's father? I don't remember Israel ever kidnapping a Palestinian Olympic team and slaughtering all 12 of them.Israel has definitely done some bad things, but it's nowhere near the level of what Palestine and Hamas have done to Israel.
When I get into the weeds with someone, and they defend a position that is so obviously wrong and don't address my points, I have to take a step back and think whether or not there is a lot of money to be made for people believing their stance. 90% of the time, the answer is yes. As an example, companies really want to make polyester and vinyl clothes. It is cheap as hell, and half of all polyester for clothing is made in China. They will defend these practices online, seemingly using the might of mainland China's government to do so. Normal people in real life don't defend polyester to the degree certain redditors do in certain green/fashion subreddits. When you click on their accounts, its like they search for every mention of it on reddit, posting 'top of all time' reposts on big subs to refresh their karma levels between astroturfing.
So what kind of rounds are we seeing? This is wild
In less than a minute the video ignores the rockets that Hamas launched on Oct 7.  Hamas claims they launched 5000.  The entire premise of the video is misinformation.
Gaza Health Ministry is a part of Hamas. Their statements are meaningless.
They've been expanding. They're now in smaller cities such a Raleigh.
Agreed
Isn‚Äôt Russia all about ‚Äústopping Nazis in Ukraine‚Äú right now? Don‚Äôt tell me that was a lie‚Ä¶
They are not on the side of Israel, trust me - those guys HATE Jews. There‚Äôs not enough context here to know what happened but the black hebrews are generally not warm to Jews at all
Yes and no. God is supposed to "give" them back Isreal. They are forbidden from taking it by force or founding a Jewish state elsewhere. Isreal has pretty clearly been taken by force, so to those people modern Isreal is a crime against God.
IT IS PALESTINIAN LAND. Stop victimising urself. I support Hamas?!?!??!!??! Where's Ur evidenceKilling is never ok no matter WHO it is. If u had moral conscience u wud know that You keep crying HAMS HAMAS HAMAS!!!!!! Pls show me videos of Hamas bombing hospitals and children and elders, stopping water supply, preventing emergency services from helping injuredCuz I sure have seen alot of fkn Israelis doing thatDon't even try to sugar coat that and replace it with Ur lies
We live in very crazy times
They didn‚Äôt even flinch
IOF
Yeah apparently an entire consensus of Jewish Historians, the CIA world factbook, the UN, Amnesty international, none of them know better than redditors. Honestly my bad for even thinking such nonsense really.
"War is the fastest way to advance tech with blood stained cash, then many people try to justify the process years later."Japan did something bad, but many Asian countries would end up staying colonized by Japan if US didn't join the war&amp;#x200B;Many countries use the captive and refugee scientists to advance their tech by many folds.
Small IED
&gt;slaughtering a bunch of innocent civilians in spite.Just like Israel is doing
Says the person who lives in Kentucky lol. Talk about ignorance...
No. Lesbians aren't your cannon fodder.
Just re-reading your bullshit, and again\&gt;The last time the Israeli government expanded its borders was in 1967. Later, they withdrew from many territories they had occupied.No. This is untrue. This is the great criticism from israels "Eminent" historian Benny Morris who is a defender of Israel's actions in more than a few ways, that they never did return the land they took along the western Bank in 1967. You can actually quite clearly see if you look at any map that no, they have [definitely continued to seize land since 1967.](https://www.progressispossible.org/issues/borders-territory/) In fact they have lost over half the remaining land they had since 67. You cannot be a real humanLike literally everything you have said is just complete and utter cow shit
Hero of the internet for today
No it just means that civilians are being bombed
The problem is having your cake and eating it too, you can‚Äôt bomb the bjeezus out of a country then turn around and try to make them love you. Smack them around, make your point, gtfo. Easier and more effective.
Godspeed friend, godspeed
Curious if anyone is looking for Palestinian passengers like this..
Well, if they did come take it, I wouldn't go slaughtering a bunch of innocent civilians in spite. Nothing I have said insinuates any type of ignorance on the situation.
Fuck that shit. Another decades long counter insurgency in the middle east isn't worth it. Just bomb every Iranian oil tanker, military base and gov building. We've been overdue for an Asian War and we got some weirdos who think they're the Middle Kingdom to bomb. God almighty I pray I get to volunteer as a combat medic in the 2nd Pacific War. Being Canadian and a Filipino mean I'm expected to commit war crimes that'll be recorded for posterity.
The black Israelites are super inconsequential. Unless you mean general Jew-Arab/Muslim tension? But I've literally seen these same 10 isrealite dudes in Chicago in the loop just being idiots shouting dumb shit. I don't think anyone really cares what they think, and shouldn't. There's what, 80,000 some odd Palestinians in Chicago. Who gives a fuck what 10 fucking dudes on a street corner have to say about it. They hold as much power as the same dude shouting in a megaphone about everyone burning in hell.

Omg those poor oppressed people üò≠üáµüá∏. They just wanted to say hi.
&gt; a lot of people are going to get hurt in the process Such a low-key way of describing 3,000 dead Palestinian children.This is genocide that Israel are perpetrating.
The technology is still in its infancy. In open terrain it has some utility, but what if there are doors or steps in the way? At some point you just have to accept that a bomb works better. Or just the tried and true method of sending in some warm bodies equipped with night vision gear
That is not what she said. What she did say wasn't good, but she didn't say that the kids in Gaza deserved to be murdered Plenty of groups in Israel have protested the government and its far-right ideals. There was a very large movement to oust Netanyahu, in part because of his treatment of Palestinian civilians. Israeli people stand up to its government. Why don't the Palestinians stand up the theirs?
So just a proportional response, then? Gaza says Israel shouldn't exist, so Israel returns the favor?
Team sports and tribalism with people is disgusting...
No...but funny enough they CONDEMNED ISREAL
No not a war it's a massacre. Idk where you are from but imma guess from the name and ignorance you're American.  You should leave your home and give the land your home your car keys your everything you own to the indigenous people. You know since it's not yours to begin with.
Brother why are you being hostile to some random dude, all they said is Chicago and you gotta freak the fuck out and be weird about it.
Yeah, Also when they kicked the Palestinians out, they all moved to southern Lebanon via Syria.....can guess who started the Lebanon Civil war and WHO currently controls half the countryOnly Iranian backed proxies and Morons support the Palastinians. Most of us, least my entire family. Wanna watch Gaza turned into a parking lot for what they done to Jordan and Lebanon
Door to door &amp; tunnel to tunnel.
The [Gaza health ministry has released the names, ages and identity card numbers of all those killed](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2023/10/27/middleeast/gaza-death-toll-report-intl/index.html). They think this figure underestimates how many have been killed, many bodies are trapped under rubble.It‚Äôs been difficult for medics to respond to bombings as Israel cut off their mobile and internet access, so ambulances simply drive towards where there are explosions.Israel has demanded the al-Quds hospital be evacuated as they will bomb it. There are hundreds of patients, some in intensive care units and babies in incubators, and moving them is impossible. Around 14,000 displaced civilians are also understood to be sheltering in the hospital and its grounds.I‚Äôm sure if you are an Irishman like I am, you are showing solidarity with the innocent civilians of Palestine during this abhorrent attack.
Reminds me of 9/11 or pearl harbour.The violence inflicted upon imperial Japan by the United States was horrific. Not to shy away from the violence of imperial Japan, quite frankly the war for the Philippines, and the liberation, makes modern conflicts a pale comparison. People never understand just how bad things can get.

Time to start teaching civilians how to kick out the ankle of a person running from consequence
That's what Im trying to figure out, I'm curious what actually caused this scuffle. Normally, you would think they would be protesting collectively against Israel.
"won't worry about revenge if your enemies are dead or severely crippled" This situation is just...so...fked
Not according to the geneva convention. Some effort must be made to reduce civilian casualties. When the other military uses the civilians as a shield that is the war crime.
There use to be different sects, some believed they were a lot tribe, some believe they are the originals, etc. Some also believe first nations were Hebrew as well.It's some wild stuff.
Why do you think this is misinformation? The video sourced their info from the survivors themselves.
Yeah, we did.We learned that people are the worst.
It was *calling* for a ceasefire. That's all it was.
How is that racist when it‚Äôs the truth? Almost all cultures on this planet have raped and pillaged at some point in history. FYI, I‚Äôm half Arab.Instead of employing the common keyboard warrior‚Äôs go-to of ‚Äúracism‚Äù, I suggest you read a history book.
I no joke saw someone who was simultaneously arguing for a ceasefire and that Israel should go to war with Iran for funding Hamas...
Or they could just say that zelensky is a Jew
They‚Äôre already being taught how to do that in their schools.
8000 is a conservative number

Lebanon has a non government army (hezbollah) that just kind of hangs out inside their boarders. It‚Äôs mostly of a remnant of the 2006 war and a power flex for Iran in the region. Occasionally they bicker with isreal, sometimes they slot in for Assad in Syria. Recently they got really into filming themselves shooting down communication towers. No one seems to love having them there but Lebanon is working really hard to get their ship straight (ecconomy, corruption, sect squabbles) so they don‚Äôt want start another civil war right now. I know it sounds crazy from a western perspective but in the Middle East these nongovernment Islamic paramilitary orgs are pretty common.
And Israel?
Lmfao you would be surprised if you see khabib past controversial statements.
Damn Jordan made a comeback after the 6 day war, only 537 losses vs 3,700 Palestinians losses
A ceasefire would be nice. But this isnt NCP so. Uuhh. Kill all muslims I guess? I dont know. I'm just here to fuck planes.
I am proud of your son. The future of the psycho warmongers is secure.
100%. Hamas are bunch of pussies. Battle of Mousul wasn‚Äôt pretty but it had to be fought and I believe during the battle majority of the civi left. So was the battle of Fallujah as well.
Arguing?  Lol they're doing alot more than that. Bunch of deranged psychopaths
Key word being god. Religious zealots the world over cause more disruption and death than any other faction.
Nation of Islam is waiting in the wings...
If they go with option 1 they could build a larger buffer between the city and Israel so they have more time and flexibility to respond to future attacks. I think the crossing to work in Israel is over. That doesn‚Äôt solve the problem of the rockets though.
Oh, such racism. Impressive, it seems i can't find an Israeli sub that isn't filled with vile ignorant and stupid xenophobic people.
This video and the video of premature IED explosion in West Bank for some reason remind me of my sex life...
Stealing that.
There's politicians who are literally saying that the kids in Gaza deserved being murdered https://old.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/17iywat/politician_freaks_out/Could people are the very least, condemn that? Or would that make people guilty of supporting Hamas?

It‚Äôs really about the content. Not sure why the voices and ‚Äúcharacters‚Äù were so popular.
You just reminded me of the TikTok cringe where I saw a women film herself drank bottle water and wash her face and film her own reaction toward the Israel counter attack at Gaza. Sadly I couldn‚Äôt find it anymore. Maybe that‚Äôs a good thing.

More or less. Arabs always lived in the middle east, millenium before they were called arabs. Their genetic epicentre is yemen, but they expanded a long time ago.Palestinians are also not purely arab, but the expected mosaic of levantine, middle east,  and egyptian dna, palestinians are the result of the history of that zone, people that were there since the beginning of history, got assimillated by jews, then christians, and then muslim arabs. That's why there were palestinian christians and jews living along with them.
I guess you could call an homemade IED in the west bank a 'firecracker', although I wouldn't belittle its power to inflict damage.(and it's in the west bank as the title suggests :))
It doesn‚Äôt worry me. We live in a secular country which a secular constitution. Nothing is going to change. Evangelicals are a vocal minority but they are a minority. They‚Äôre not going to impose their will on the whole country and thinking they will is just fear mongering.Also, comparing the abortion debate in the US to a literal pogrom of Jews as shown in this video is ridiculous
Top notch airport security in Dagestan‚Ä¶
Remarkable that any person can see this and think it‚Äôs acceptable.If you support this, you support the killing of children, human rights abuses and mass destruction. CEASEFIRE NOW.
Because what‚Äôs the purpose of discussing something that happened hundreds of years ago? Religions change over time like everything else. The Catholicism of today is far different than the one of 1700 which is different than 1200 which is different than 400‚Ä¶The idea that religion is just a tool of control is just an outdated Marxist idea. religion helps shapes social norms - wow so evil! It also contributed and contributes tremendously to all sorts of good things like charity and education.
Let‚Äôs keep letting more crazy people in the country‚Ä¶
Yep, the only truly fair and unbiased way to determine control is by fighting for it.Clearly, third party mediation did not work. The UN tried to make an equitable solution based on population distribution, and failed. Palestine rejected the partition plan, and opted to instead determine their borders through the trial of war.
What‚Äôs the deal with all the deleted comments?
On other hand, gopros are TOP tool for tactical research and improvement later

Its not even really a cost thing , especially if those figures are accurate. Its simply the right tool for the job. IR missiles are better geared towards engagements at this range than Aim-120s that are more suited for BVR.

I read something about a lot of orthodox jews are against the state of israel/zionists, because something in the torah about Yahweh saying Jewish people should never have a country? So they can have communities but shouldn't have a "Jewish state" as it were.Also the humanitarian reasons of course, but just an interesting reason too.

If You use Religion to control the masses and are Indoctrinated/ing to hate, that totally misses the point of said Religion. For me it's about personal growth, the afterlife, and ways to live life in a more positive way. If awolcowboy had a corporate job with a Legit structure, and they found out he said that, he wouldn't have a job . "\_\_\_\_\_insert group are this way.." is literally a bill burr joke.

I just wonder how soon before Iran or other countries get involved. I mean like troops on the ground. What the fuck are we getting involved in? Like Israel says, ‚Äú‚Ä¶this is only the beginning.‚ÄùIf Hamas is defeated will it create a vacuum for some other enemy? Will this just slow them down?

Unfortunately, this is how many of the right-wing Christians in my state and our country feel., leading them to vote for a group of reactionaries.The new republican speaker of the house is an evangelical Christian who stated we should be a "Biblical Republic."

So they ARE hunting Jewish people. And this is happening no where near the site of the conflict. How is this being allowed? How this isn‚Äôt the top story everywhere? They are hunting Jewish people. Do we need a history lesson here folks?

That logic is completely flawed. The death of a civilian is on the hands of both the killer and the person hiding behind them.Hamas using civilians as human shields doesn't give israel the right to bomb indiscriminately.
Dagestan loves Russia they have been fighting alongside Russia for a long time (even going back to the russian empire times). You are confusing Dagestan with Chechnya.

You dont want 3000 Eurofighters from Austria, they¬¥ll just fall out of the sky and cant even take off when conditions are not optimal.
It's not just Tik Tok. Social media in general has proven very effective at inciting mob violence over the last 15 years. It's responsible for more than one genocide (or "ethnic cleansing" if you want to soft-peddle it).

Gallant and bibi have cited they will chase  lebanon (Hezbollah) after they're done with gaza in the escalation eve
Except nobody wanted to take the Palestinians. Not even their neighbor Egypt. Also one question that comes to mind: you know how all these rich ~~human-rights-absent~~ arab countries are always looking into importing cheap labour from Southern and SE Asians? Why not Palestine?
I just want to know who benefits. There is some person or people at the top of this thing and they‚Äôre getting something out of their army of morons.
Got an actual source for your claim or what?
Why should the Christians get another try? They got kicked out of Jerusalem like little bitches.  It's time the Bhuddists or nordic pagans get to govern the holy land.
One person shouldn‚Äôt be responsible for the actions of another. That‚Äôs it.
Same here in san diego, stand on a soapbox, and spew hate. Being of  mixed race, I've been told I belong nowhere, and the day is coming. I'll be put in a cage when they rise up. I just laugh at them lol
I'm white and my ex husband decided to be a BI a few years after we divorced. Talked down to me so much for being white despite the fact that his first two wives were white and his three children are biracial. He became a completely different person so quickly it was disturbing

Yeah and what if gaza elects Hamas as their government (again).
Definitely. Most of these countries are drawing their lines in the sand, becoming clear where people stand

I asked chatGPT this a while ago and we come up with a list of hunderd and hunderds of the most known scientist that where involved with the Manhattan project and then we had it calculate how many where jewish or had a jewish background. It was about 27%. I double checked each name by finding the wikipedia pages and chatGPT was correct.
Any idea what they are using?
Islamic men are at least consistently crazy everywhere. I tip my cap to that kind of commitment!
Wtf, how can the Christians retake Jerusalem if we glass it? Ban deserved tbh.
Sounds like that's why historically they were persecuted and blamed for others' issues. They were smarter and most comfortable with finance. Medical, engineering, science, banking are all fields they excel at earning them high ranking global positions.Instead of blaming them for what they earned, their enemies should be looking inward at their values trying to mimic success. But ofc that's not how the world works...

Yeah, maybe visit Israel. There is no genocide. I met lots of Israeli Arabs. Heck, it was hard to tell who was who, outside of Jerusalem. Not like people wear badges.

I feel an urge to try to gain communication with these people and get them to start yelling ‚Äú*tally-ho!*‚Äù every time they fire it on camera.On a serious note, this showcases that no amount of disarmament will ever stop committed and motivated people from fighting. The human mind is a dangerous weapon.
Because they are literally all Bedouins. They are nomadic Arab tribesmen. The Bedouin tribes in Southern Israel swore loyalty to the Israeli government, early on, like the Druze. And they've totally solid guys. Good friends and fearsome enemies.Part of the deal is the Bedouin and Druze serve in their own units. Many of them are Scout/Pathfinder units. It fits in with their traditional methods of warfare.
Interesting learn! It's almost like religion has a place in this world for those that choose to participate, as long as it's not near a position of leadership and decision making. It's simply too illogical and stubborn to change to foster prosperity.At the individual level, it's fine, it gives folks a sense of purpose and fulfillment and as someone non-religious, I have no issue with that. But when laws and decisions are made based off it, from my observation, is when a state begins to crumble, a subset of its society be oppressed, and eventually collapse.
Yeah. Forget the Jews in the IDF - these guys are WAY harder core.
Yeah.... I mean, your families government could have invested in peace. Instead, they lob bombs the other way and cheer the genocide of jews.It happened so often that Isreal had no choice but to create an Iron dome.
Hezbawho?
I think Russia's army is busy
Sorry, but this is racial - they are looking for Jewish blood.
Humans never get tired of war. We take breaks but then we get right back at it.
Why are flights from Israel even going to Dagestan?
Can someone explain to me how things like, stuff shown in the video, or Lebanon blowing up a Israeli tank with a TOW a few days ago. Yet these countries are not at war?
We might lose that war. For all those out there that think we‚Äôre too big to fail.
Right?
Absolutely correct. Any sort of massed troop movement usually requires vehicles and staging areas. The Gerald ford carrier group can react with overwhelming firepower in about 2-3 hours. So good luck, I guess.
There's also a pretty sizable portion of BHIs who believe that Native American history is all fake and that the BHIs were on North America before Native Americans. They actively deny all of the suffering Native Americans went through
It‚Äôs very alive on Reddit I have learned in the past two weeks.
Agreed, both groups are experiencing psychosis with this level of dedication to a sky daddy
This won‚Äôt be anything more than a flare up. Black Hebrew Israelites are all talk and very small in numbers and those Palestinian supporters will move on with their lives and hating real Jews in a week or so. It‚Äôs sad but there nothing between these groups that would push things further
neither of them, because according to historical accounts they are the same people. From a legal point of view, however, Israel currently alone has the right to legitimately claim land there and since Israel is a free democracy and the only stable country there, it should remain that way. Nobody there needs an Islamist state from Hamas, as it continues to destabilize neighboring countries.
This is why guns.
It's not that simple.  Many of the access points are located in basements of buildings/residences.
There are more willing to stand up we just have jobs and families
Yes, a very disappointing allahu Akbar to explosion ratio
Black Israelites are obnoxious as fuck but not a threat for the most part. They preach hate but hold little to no influence. They are estimated at less than half a percent of the black population. Keep in mind black Americans are overwhelmingly Christian and support the state of Israel, and there are more black Americans that identity as being atheistic in belief than of the Black Hebrew Israelites. While it‚Äôs understandable that Jews would be concerned, please do not assume this is a large movement because it absolutely is not. Most of us just laugh and ignore them because we know they have no influence in America.
They are screwed! With such precision weapons and skilled military they are foolsntonthinknthy can take the IDF on.
This could literally be said during any moment in history
At least the JWs tend to go away if asked politely.
Body armor shows up as gray against cloths and weapons can still be seen. A few videos here show that. But others just show people with clothes and no weapons. Blur doesn't hide allThe fact these videos are in this sub yet still being denied is laughable and proof of who is populating this sub
Yep. If the US ever goes back into a country, I imagine it is going to look a lot like the Ryan Doctrine from Clancy's stuff. Bomb the leadership of a nation, destroy their military capability, and then leave because they are no longer a threat. And if the state collapse because of this, that is just the cost of making an enemy.

Organized religion is fun.
Bottom line: 4:40 "Do we absolve Hamas of their actions on October 7th? Of course not. None of this would have happened had they not attacked."
that's kind of what the idf wanted to do. they told everyone to evacuate to the border and that they would bomb tf out of their city and thair infrastructure, it's war, so it's fair, and then go on from there. But hamas interfered just to cause civilian casualties and paint the idf as the bad guy. Sick people, if we wanna call them that, though that is debatable
Such a weak, ‚Äúboth sides!‚Äù argument. Please tell me what the Shintos are currently doing that makes them so bad

Israel has its fair share of religious values implemented into a big part of our society, it is also a wildly debated topic between atheists and the secular community to the more religious community, separting state from religion isn't something that's really been done yet, and it has caused a lot of clashes in our time here.One thing that can be sure, the economic difference, and quality of life difference between more religious and less religious communities is staggering, and in places like Tel-Aviv and Bnei Brak, a 10 minute drive takes you from one of the most modern and richest places in the world, to one of the most densley populated, unemployed and poorest cities in all of Israel, actually insane.
If anyone wonders what Pogroms might have looked like over the centuries, imagine this kind of thing, except it ending in gruesome assaults and killings of jews, often while authorities either stood back and let it happen or joined in themselves. Also this is another event that proves that yes, it is often actually about Jewish people and not just the Israeli governments actions or the concept of Zionism. When there's shit like this where people are aggressively looking for , and chasing down people of a specific ethnic or religious group and demanding to see their paperwork for proof they're Jewish or not. When there's synagogues burned down, apartments where jews live having star of davids painted on the doors, Or when the leaders of the groups who fight against Israel keep telling the world that yes they do actually want to rid the world of jews and zionists, it makes it really hard for me to not think there's a lot of people out there with their heads buried in the sand on all this. Of course we can and should criticize the Israeli government and the extremists there and in the west bank, without it all being dismissed as Antisemitism. Netanyahu seems to be very unpopular in Israel, hopefully hes gone soon. But it's incredibly naive to think this issue is only about border disputes or the actions of a countries government. There's protests where kids are chanting "Globalize the Intifada" and then events like this video where kids are cowering in fear as angry mobs hunt them down for flying in from Tel Aviv .. what year is it?
The Shareef don‚Äôt like it
No, but they've condemned Israel more than any other nation in the world. In fact, Israel has been condemned by them more than double the amount of times than every other nation in the world combined.That definetly screams impartial organization to me. While Israel undeniably has done some fucked up shit, it's orders of magnitude less than other nations have been allowed to get away with by the UN
Crack out the ol moka pot
I don't even think Israel is capable of giving a single fuck right now.If Hamas cared its people it'd surrender. I think that's what all these protestors just ignore. "Reee history, reeeee peace, reeee civilians" as if Israel cares about the cost of getting rid of Hamas. Has the UN even condemned Hamas yet? What a useless organisation.
‚ÄúBefore you say it, no our arm bands aren‚Äôt what you think they are. That one is tilted 45 degrees, ours is 50. Totally different‚Äù
Anyone going to Russia right now gets what's coming to them
the black, hebrew, israelites both confuse and frighten me.
That was the strategy in 2001-2020 but given the outcome do you really think it will be repeated any time soon? Like if another 9/11 happens, my thought is a likely US response would involve much less in terms of bringing democracy to a place that lacked existing support for it, and less boots on the ground generally.
This what is being justified around the world. Palestinian people need love and support. It can be done without siding with terrorists, vindicating terror tactics, chanting genocide slogans, etc etc. If terror wins, we will be mourning 10x, 100x, 1000x around the world. Hamas needs to surrender. BiBi needs to go. Real peace needs to be negotiated without terrorists.
Fuck Palestine.

Hamas just killed 40,000 of their citizens today, after poisoning the water in Khan Yunis, according to the PA Health Authority. So what do you say to that?
They might be stupid enough to do it.
Religion is a perfectly sound, based, logical system generating healthy, normal rational people. A proven system as old as time immemorial, demonstrated and measurable.
Warsona
Lack of religious freedom and belief in liberal principles of letting people believe as they wish without having to smash anyone that thinks differently is the root cause. The slaughter of people over religious differences does not end when those in power are atheist unless they also believe in religious freedom. The idea that if everyone just thought exactly as I do we wouldn‚Äôt have these problems, is an old one that has frequently lead to violence.
Lol at their support for the same powers that put them in the ghettos

Einstein didn't work on the bomb project. I don't know about 90% but yeah the vast majority of the scientists were Jewish.
This is insane.
took them 6 months, If Isreal was to do it, it will take them 5 mins with 1 JDAM 2000 pounder.1 minute to call in an airstrike, 3 minutes 55 sec to smoke a cigarette. and 5 sec to watch it blow up.
‚ÄúYo, fuck that house in particular‚Äù
No matter how good or wrong the actions of the Israeli government are, if you go out to "hunt the jews", you are not acting under any rational motive. You were just waiting for a reason to validate your urges.

&gt;~~The Nazis~~ Hamas entered this war under the rather childish delusion that they were going to bomb everyone else, and nobody was going to bomb them. At ~~Rotterdam, London, Warsaw,~~ Ascalon, Tel Aviv,  and half a hundred other places, they put their rather naive theory into operation. They sowed the wind, and now they are going to reap the whirlwind.-Statement of ~~1942~~ 2023, at the start of the bombing campaign against ~~Germany~~ Hamas, as quoted in "Sir Arthur Harris &amp; The Lancaster Bomber" at The British Postal Museum and Archive
They are very resourceful combatants that's for fucking sure, but I guess they have had decades to ponder their new ideas on a very low budget.

I dont think there is a right however, who i like to say who would you rather live next door to you?
&gt; Israel has been bulldozing Palestinian homes and then putting settlers in newly built homes. Yes, Israel bulldozes homes of people that receive ["Martyr's Fund"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Authority_Martyrs_Fund) payments.Even the [UN Human Rights Office](https://www.ohchr.org/en/stories/2015/12/punitive-demolitions-destroy-more-homes-occupied-palestinian-territory) refers to them as punitive, not random.I've got some seriously mixed feelings on it, so don't feel like I'm attempting to defend it, but as usual with this conflict, there's a lot more to the story than most headlines would like you to believe...
and most of them, g-d willing, will survive and then be able to enjoy productive lives where they'll hopefully develop even more innovations for humanity!
By making sure everyone claims Israel is in violation of a ceasefire and is therefore a war criminal

Funny you say that, because for first, women and children in Gaza can‚Äôt vote, most of the population in Gaza are made of women and children. Almost seems like you haven‚Äôt done your research.
It is 100% tied together. The alliances are now forming in front of our eyes.
People are stupid and insane.
Dammit!
Well one could have traitors on any side, with a google search you could find tons of Israelis who are fighting against the Zionist cause and the are also Muslims who support it. Anything can happen in war... Just like how there were Japanese who fought in the U.S army during WW2.
Does it make it right though?
No, the correct answer is protozoa.
Nazis killed more then jews. Like for example russians.
Why attack buildings if Hamas is in tunnels?
I am still waiting for the Muslim world to be upset over the Houthi genocide..... I know they won't, no Jews or Americans to blame. 377k civilians dead (70% children) in the last 8 years, but sure, let's ignore that.
I'm just pointing out the history of antisemitism in Russia. This isn't new. Russians really seem to hate Jews.
Evacuate to the south right? But Israel is still bombing the south so where do they go all the borders are closed? Egypt refuses to open our border no matter what and so does Israel so where are they supposed to flee?
lmao, you keep jumping all over the place without actually engaging in what i say. its clear youre fishing for something.
Haha didn't expect to see this comment here!
Do liberals realize that most of them oils be killed or jailed in Palestine even if Hamas wasn‚Äôt in charge because being involved with LGBTQ is a death sentence.
For aerial bayonet charges, of course.
What you described fits most definitions of the term 'terrorism.'
Christopher Hitchens couldn't have said it better himself.
Moscow is meeting with Hamas. There is a pogrom currently happening in Dagestan. I'm not sure what you're getting at. Russia is antisemitic.
This is not news. 1. We (NATO) will also study the attack and war. It will likely be taught in certain academies. We would be daft not to study it. 2. I question china is going to use this technique and question who this guy has been actually talking to. China has a navy and actual airforce. I have no doubt they will study what happened butyl to think they are going to use HAMAS tactics is laughableEDIT: I actually believe china will study, learn from and then try war gaming the urban ops performed by isreal instead. Far more to be gained.
Yea because this is going to make everything better.
Am I the only one not seeing any Hezbollah forces?
It'll only take years.

The last election was 16 years ago, when half of the current population in Gaza wasn't even born. Yea man, keep blaming the children.

Again, I already gave my apology for the generalization in another comment. You will not get one. If you have nothing else to offer, I hope you have a great day
No, that one was covered. It's a CNN article. I was going to edit my comment because of this 1 incident but decided not to. Can you find another?

Persona?
It might be a trick, quick somebody ask Austria if any rejected art student entered politics.
UN is like software programmers.They always uses a temporary solution as their permanent solution until it became ineffective the next time it breaks.Either find a way to defuses the extremist view from both side or piss off, frozen conflicts only ends up as what it would be a teaser for where the next war are going to occur because most of the time no effort was made to make sure the conflict to not happen again when it was frozen.
Getting close to gundam and zoids, which tech tree do you want your kid to specialize in?

No thanks. It was meant to be unambiguous. And to be for the neutralization of Hamas is also to be for the future of the Palestinian people. Hamas doesn‚Äôt give a damn about Palestinians.

What a peaceful race.
What are you referencing?This page says 73.5% Jewish and 21% Arab:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_IsraelMizrahi Jews (grandparents born in the Middle East or North Africa) are Jews.
You realize that I ly a very small percentage of strikes kill anyone the other days Israel announced like 400 airstrikes, but only about 400 were killed by Hamas, of course they don't distinguish between civilians and militants in purpose, to insure the world thinks they are all civilians, which if course we know they are not. But the point is only casualty per air strike is precision, otherwise there would be like 4.000 killed every day. Most of the strikes at this point are hitting tunnels, weapon stores, rocket launchers, etc and Hamas fighters. They are softening up very northern Gaza before they go in full force in the ground . This area has been evacuated for the most part except for Hamas and whoever they are forcing to stay there as human shields.
People are so crazy about a damn god.

The English language is filled with loan words lmao. That‚Äôs nothing of worth.
I think we might see a very serious regional war. Something bigger than Vietnam, Iraq etc... it won't be at the level of WW2... I hope.It's baked in that Lebanon is going to hit Israel and from there if Iran or Syria also jump in then it's a full blown regional war. The US will be launching air strikes in the area.Then what? Hard to say. The US won't do as well against Iran as ppl think. It's by far the best military in the area. How did the US do against the vastly inferior Afghan and Iraq? Not well.It's also good for Russia advancing more into Ukraine... so there is that too... as well as another regional conflict brewing in Niger / north west Africa. There is always North Korea too. It would be wise to take the temperature down now.
At this point I think the point for Israel is to make it absolutely clear to everyone that they should be terrified of the prospect if attacking Israel and harming its people. There's revenge here, certainly, but also to prove a point. It seemed to work with hezbollah a few years ago when Israel did massive damage to Lebanon, which is thought to be a major reason hezbolla won't get involved past a few boarder skirmishes. They don't want to get flattened again.This is Israel saying "let them hate us, as long as they fear us".Problem with that is it requires the absolute maintenance of that capacity. Once someone smells weakness they will come for you. That, along with the fact that a lot of people are getting hurt in the process.

&gt;Yes the Coalition should just level Fallujah instead of going door-to-door and risking their own men's lives.&gt;Yes the Allies should shoot all surrendering Japanese rather than risk dying to a grenade.It's easy to provide justifications for war crimes. We know why Hamas wants to do it, doesn't make it not a war crime. The fact the IDF is a superior military power does not permit them to commit war crimes. The terrorist supporters only seem to care about one side's war crimes, though.
Claiming neutrality was just a ploy to remain undetected.The 3000 black Eurofighters of Austria will arrive in theater soon.
It is worth noting that "pogrom" is a loan word from Russian.

I agree that voting for Bibi will result in what we see in this video
5%of Russians are Muslim, over 70% are orthodox Christian. The average Russian is not muslim but catholic. That is what I meant.Anti-Semitic behavior is not a ‚Äútime honored *russian*‚Äù tradition. I could rattle of more than two thousand years worth of anti Semitic ‚Äútraditions‚Äù perpetrated by countless nations and empires. This video is showing Muslims actively using their religion to justify their brutality and yet you call it a ‚ÄúRussian‚Äù tradition. Guess all those beheadings in the Middle East over being gay or daring to speak out against the inequalities of the Islamic regime was ‚Äúa Russian thing‚Äù.
Yes, Israel has evacuated its northernmost towns due to repeated rocket/TOW strikes from the Lebanon side.
Yeah you cannot use your NCD persona outside of this sub unless you follow it with /s
If it was because of their religion, why weren't flights before Israel's siege of Gaza being protested against like this? The religion haven't changed

I don't believe the crusades have anything to do with current events, but they lasted a little over 200 years, and it ended over 700 years ago. There are definitely Christian extremists in the world, in not denying that. In saying I have seen any Christian or Jew attacking Muslims outside of Palestine/Israel since this most recent conflict started. I have seen and read about many incidents involving Muslims attacking Jews outside of Israel in recent weeks. This post is a prime example. This airport is not a warzone, and these people are not combatants. Why are they being attacked? I will say I don't know what exactly is happening in this video or how credible it is but it definitely isn't the only incident like this.
https://ucr.fbi.gov/crime-in-the-u.s/2019/crime-in-the-u.s.-2019/topic-pages/tables/table-6There are like 30 cities ahead of Chicago in terms of per capita shootings and crime. Cities like Cleveland, Little Rock, Shreveport, Memphis, Kansas City, Baton Rouge, Dayton, and Birmingham are more dangerous per capita. Yet, for some reason, people only focus on Chicago, acting like it is an active war zone for everyone that lives there.
just move all the civilians to a floating country for a few months, get all the people who wanna fight into the Israel-Palestine area, and do a war without civilian casualties. Whoever wins gets the area.

I think they learned from Bush from 9/11. Allow an attack to shock the population and then use that as an excuse to massively attack and target even those unrelated to the initial event.
From my experience they seem to be a scam group for guilt ridden white people. I‚Äôve never seen any violence from them but all the shit they talk seem to work. Some of the white people who sits there and argue with them and even kissing their feet is downright sad but funny at the same time.

While everyone is yelling at someone for this crap, US regulators are going to attach the ‚Äútoo-big-to-fail‚Äù label to institutions like hedge funds, more banks, etc next week. Those same hedge funds are the groups that wash money for war criminals all over the world, and they are also the same people who put us in our current economic situation. The government is trying to shovel tax dollars into the pockets of the filthy rats who are responsible for all these problems. Please‚Ä¶for the next week, talk to people about this. Don‚Äôt turn away from what‚Äôs going on in your own country by a war half a world away‚Ä¶a war in which both sides are getting financing through us.Talk about the war, but also talk about the things our own government is doing along with it.

 Has the northern border become an active conflict zone? I doubt Israel pushes into southern Lebanon but does Hezbollah try to attack the border? I‚Äôm not sure what the next move is for either side but these videos keep popping up of explosions on both sides.
You'd think they would be a fan of senseless murder.

Russia is a massive country with many different ethnic groups. Most of those ethnic groups, with the exception of Jews themselves, have engaged in pogroms against Jews at some point in their recent (last 100 or so years) history. Perhaps they are not white European Russians, but they are engaging in a time honoured Russian tradition.
why they all look like khabib
Yup and the freaks come out to down vote
This is fucking hillarious considering that day after day the Hungarian propaganda is spewing bullshit about the need for a ceasefire and peace in Gaza, and then we vote against it.Truly an Orb√°n moment.Please someone rescue me from here.
If you look and listen closely it‚Äôs not the average Russian looking for the Jewish people.
I'm glad that you don't feel that way. I honestly didn't mean to group all of Islam together. Things like that don't help at all, either. My apologies
I have a strange feeling that there's no coming back from this. We'll struggle with the hate between these groups for years to come, and innocent people who don't give a crap will be caught in the crossfire.
Strong arm robbery.  A serious offence
It‚Äôs the fault of both countries because they have not finally settled their grievances over the decades. The peace talks must have come down to the core of the problem. Probably over land. In that moment one or both sides failed to sacrifice.Until that moment returns, and sacrifices‚Äî-or at least safety guarantees are made, many humans will die from both countries.
We had resolution for cease fire where only Israel stops firingNow do one where only Hamas stops firing
Religion is a curse in modern society. It only seems to separate more than it brings together.
LMAO Now I have truly seen it all !
I'm Muslim and I don't feel that way. but alright.
I hear so many people ask, what is the harm if someone wants to believe in a religion. This, this is the harm.
Ok, and the origin of those Jews? Because the Wikipedia puts half of them as north Africa or Asia.
Atheists are clearly the smartest group in humanity.
That is literally what loose sprinkles is trying to do here.
The entire Irish civil war
What kind of comment is this ? Not a once of humanity or care about those kids. None. It‚Äôs seems to justify the horrific things you see in the video. So it‚Äôs ok to mass kill civilians and mass murder of kids over their government? Isn‚Äôt that the justification of Hamas of the 7 October attack?

I completely respect that religion can take people from a dark place mentally, give them a goal greater than themselves to work towards and achieve happiness. But so can lots of other activities, groups, and occupations that don‚Äôt have the side effect of spontaneous mob violence.

Religion is the root cause of all these issues.
How is security allowing this? Where is the police, army even? All these people should be in Jail
No, not really. There are some Hebrew and Christian groups that teach hate, but not as widespread as it is in Islam. Look at all the recent attacks against Jews around the world because of all this. I haven't seen much about Jews and Christians attacking Palestinian people or any Muslim outside of Palestine.

That is false. You do not see the same level of vitriol towards unbelievers in the New Testament and Tanakh that you do in the Quran. The level of vitriol aimed at Yahoods in the Quran is extraordinary. Some Orthodox and Hasidic schools enforce Zionism, but they do not explicitly condone the slaughter of Muslims.
Imagine being the Israelis on board greeted to a mob on the tarmac
I think the historical rhetoric is the most interesting, I don't really care for religion so the god stuff is just silly to me but I also like the goofy stuff too. The violence is dumb but hardly surprising given their stance on that land.
Fighting in Ukraine to supposedly protect people from the horribly anti-Semitic Ukrainian government (lead by a Jewish pres) but rushing to hurt people arriving from Israel because jews are also bad?Imagine being a Russian arriving home from a business trip in Israel, only to be beaten up by your own people because you might be Jewish‚Ä¶ but hurry up and heal, you‚Äôve been drafted to defend Jewish people in Ukraine!I need a drink‚Ä¶
They really need to hire academics who aren't prestige seekers or careerists, like academics not hired through cronyism or with more life experience than just inside the ivory tower, else you get this variety - able to play the game but completely deficient in areas such as rational, civil, grown up behaviour. I am an academic who has had to put up with academics with stunted emotional maturity and egos to match.

I don‚Äôt always seek to watch it though. On many occasions, I just come across it. This is how pervasive mainstream media is in our lives.
Russia and hating Jews. A combination as old as time.
The nazis part isnt about dead jews but dead slavs. The Nazi government slaughtered more then just jews such as russian alot of russians
All it needed is too be bigger so that the weight of the b17 would barely offset its weight distribution after being impaled by it.
Also, we can see 'Maglan' unit using the 'Iron Sting' munitions, 120mm mortars guided with laser and GPS.  It's one of the newly weapons we know about so far.  I'm sure we will see couple of new tech being used in the next months of this war.
And with around 47% of gazas population being under 18 unfortunately there‚Äôs going to be alot of child deaths
You're SURE it has nothing to do with the government?
They are not defending it just they want to be the black Zionist

It's gotta be weird for them being on the same side as the cops
Fair enough, annexing was an incorrect term to describe the situation, but fighting over it is more like it \^\^ But thanks for pointing my mistake out üí™
When Russia was reducing Grozny to dust and killing up to 25k of their Muslim brothers by some estimates, did Dagestanis try to pull Russians off aircraft or is it only killings they get permission/encouragement from state media to be angry about that does it?
Looks like that building can withstand quite a beating.  Also, was that the infamous tent that was blown up in the second clip?

Last time I was in NYC I simply passed a group of them, said nothing at all and was told I was the devil incarnate.
And they say the Ukrainians are the Nazi‚Äôs. Lmao.
I just hope that Palestinian would realise how they have been used by Hamas. If not then there will be more terror coming up for Israel  because Hamas will surely manipulate palestian for they have lost their friends and family in bombing. I pray for people in Gaza but unwantedly  I have to support Israel as they are just trying to defend their people from these terrorist.
You can't bring up a single alternative example of religious violence that does not include Islam

Welcome to yayhooville
Russia did not annex dagestan is what I tried to say, they annexed Chechnya. And btw the the war in dagestan was mostly Chechens. Dagestan was fighting on Russia's side with a few cells on the insurgents side. If you look at the wiki those commanders where like 90% Chechens. And btw the war was fought mostly on the border with Chechnya so it was more like a quick insurgency.
Mine settled to the bottom of my skull.
Yea i was shocked to hear muslims serve in the Israeli occupation army. Never heard about it cuz all ppl told me was that Israel is a racist country and is committing a genocide against muslims all over the country.

Tech is the single biggest sector of the Israeli economy. Some in the industry think the war will ultimately strengthen the sector as it will likely draw support from investors keen to help the country rebuild.
Luckily there's only like 8 of them.

The US has always the best entertainement, I wasn't expecting that.
They had a [war there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Dagestan_(1999)) too
"Incredible! seeing MUSLIMS fighting alongside jews in the ISRAELI DEFENSE FORCES! im shocked! Why are muslims fight for the genocidal occupation army! Is it possible they are hypnotized? Or maybe they're forced to? Or maybe they willingly volunteer for the IDF from their own will and they know the truth about hamas?!Nah nah no way it's the last one. Option 1 is probably true."~just your average woke person living his comfortable life in a western country shitting about a subject he has zero knowledge about
&gt;Iranian Muslims then invaded the holy land. Dafuq, what source is there for this? If you're talking about Cyrus the Great, that was like 1000 years before muslims even existed.
![gif](giphy|y5W98cY6OCudO)Nobody expects the Black Hebrew Israelites!
Russia has been blaming Jews for its problems for centuries. They're an easy scapegoat that the government exploits. I'm very pro Palestine but the way Russia has treated Russian Jews is horrible.
Yes I agree... we need to see a figure head of sorts rise out of Gaza and another one in Israel where this cycle of hate and violence (on both sides) can somehow be put to bed. Israel holds a better hand of cards than Palestinians but they don't play their cards very well IMO. I think you will see a consolidation of Israel's enemies now who surround them.
Yah the experiment has run its course, it might have helped us get through some rough times in the past when our understanding of our reality was in its infancy, but now its vastly causing more problems than benefits.The way out of this situation is a mental and cultural renaissance. A new enlightenment age based on evidence not superstition.
Even without the antisemitism angle it's a bit sus. Calling for taxing the rich - Im all for it. Calling the rich lizard people crosses a line into dehumanizing that I'm not really comfortable with, especially given the focus of the original miniseries (as opposed to series that followed)on parallels to a certain historical era.
Nazi army didn't hide behind civilians. They lost the war. Goverment changed. Now Germany is one of the main forces of NATO. Palestine doesn't even return the hostages. Keeps firing rockets. "But but hamas and palestine is not same". Nobody cares
Wow, well thought out and very persuasive.... so many listed facts and all....
Thats amazing. Too bad it isn't this easy to cut through aluminium
&gt;First, the Jews.Jews were there much later than Egypcians, phoenicians, philistines and such.
You do *not* want to mess with these guys. They are seriously badass.
I think the main thing here would be that in Vietnam they had a lot more cover from eyes in the sky (jungle and such). I think you can hide a tunneling operation in gaza city, but it might be a lot more difficult in a more open area with satellites looking at everything you do
Yeah their best hope is destroying their capabilities to carry out attacks and launch rockets. And probably regime change getting them out of power. But history doesn‚Äôt speak well to other countries going in and forcing regime change. There is no good answer. The cycle of violence in the area certainly can‚Äôt end while Hamas is in control of Gaza. But I really don‚Äôt think the people of Palestine are going to want peace after this. We really need a MLK, or ghandi type figure to end this cycle of violence.
In the full video they were going into the into staff only security areas looking for jews. Love it when dumbasses film themselves commiting crimes

Won‚Äôt happen , makes no financial sense for most states. Worse things have happened and will happen , it‚Äôs just what media wants to run with that gets shown.
Egyptians.It's hard to define who was there first of those people without complete genetic studies, anthropology and archeology. Jews were "invaders" by several sources, palestinians have both jewish ancestry, but also egypcian and arab, which were all local people since "ever" basically.
Now that‚Äôs some out of box thinking we need! That‚Äôs good!
Well said, it is sad to see the world into madness and i hope the conflict will end rather quickly

Thats some engaging right there.
It is self defended for survival . Hamas is to be blamed for using innocent people as shield
Initial two are probably Spike missiles. Unless those are rocket assisted shells. Basically everything that has a glowing streak is rocket propelled.
New WarThunder Patch looks great
who started it ? hamas. Who created hamas Gaza , I understand there are children‚Äôs and innocent men/women killed in Gaza but don‚Äôt forget that Hamas  were terrorising Israel everytime, throwing rockets and   Attacking and killing innocent Jews.Just think how hard it is live everyday when the neighbours are throwing rockets everyday. Think about the children in Israel. At the moment Gaza is in terror but this terror people of Israel had been experiencing for years .
The death of innocent civilians in Gaza *is* a war crime, and that crime is being committed by Hamas not Israel. The use of human shields is in itself categorized as a specific intent war crime under the Geneva Convention and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
What if you need to poop urgently inside a tank during wartime? Are there toilets inside tanks?
Now I wonder if there are genetic markers for noncredibility, or if it's mostly cultural.Considering how human innovation is driven by Folks Unironically Doing Dumb Shit, I wouldn't be surprised if the answer is somewhere in the middle.
Yes, Hamas has between 40+50 rockets, 80k soldiers and not even accounting arms and ammunition for the soldiersand the question is: Where is that all stored?There isn't a single military base in Gaza which could even accompany that - it is all around civilians in/under housesSo Israel has every right if way bombing it, roof knocking, mass calling and flyers surely help to reduce casualties of civilians but there zero fucking chance to avoid them - the latter is solely due to Hamas tactics, that's how they hide, and every dead civilian is good PR for Hamas
In the US, Christians are trying to make us a "Biblical Republic" and strip others of their rights while oppressing those who don't follow their religious tenets.

Brilliant.
I would expect Israel, definitely with US aid should be able to detect many of those tunnel entrances. If I were Israel, I would take one, then pump it full of hot air. Closely watch the whole area at night with thermal sights. Wherever the hot air pops out, there is another exit.
This is absolutely terrible to see and we should all be calling for a ceasefire everywhere in the Middle East until some talks have taken place with neutral facilitators.

it's not hard to hide between million of civilians and be a partisan, one man's partisan is another ones terrorist. Pick off enough IDF with IEDs  , random bombs, traps and guess what they'll do? what nazis did with Lidice when Reinhard Heydrich was assassinated by partisans, civilians are going to start taking bullets since anything that moves is danger, either that OR they play it like US did and just keep taking casualties over and over while claiming that they are better than "them"...   there is no defense for this.

The mind reels at the carnage on the other end of that machine, firing into [a place with a higher population density than Boston or Chicago.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/17/gaza-size-population-comparison/) Israel has a right to self defense, but I can't imagine the toll on the civilian population being caught in such a fate, essentially forced martyrs

Fuuuuuuck that.
Israel has been bulldozing Palestinian homes and then putting settlers in newly built homes. [This video from Vox goes over some of it.](https://youtu.be/a9FbqgOi-4g?si=iKF1gCDXzkV-Qd3k)The region is trapped in a cycle of violence with different people on both sides perpetuating it. There's no road to peace when groups on both sides want to fight.
This group is a legitimately dangerous cult-gang. They stand on the streets in New York City in the Bronx, talking about killing white people, and killing Jews and taking Israel. They scream at the top of their lungs on street corners about some non-history, mythical nonsense about having been ‚Äúoriginally from Israel‚Äù. As far as I can tell, it‚Äôs basically a hate group with a pyramid scheme, that takes advantage of poor and poorly educated young people. I used to live down the street from one of their main buildings in New York, and have seen it personally. I don‚Äôt know if they truly mean to commit violence, but they sure talk about it a lot.

If I recall Israel had a bit of a scandal with ahem.... Sterilizing Ethiopian Jews who immigrated there.
Hilarious how the people who cheered on oct 7th and chanted from the river to the sea are now begging for a ceasefire lmfao
It truly feels like WWlll is upon us üò∞. I was already nervous with this Russian/Ukraine war but this‚Ä¶now with Israel and Gaza‚Ä¶the world is truly taking on another form of anger.
Did a quick google, a few answers I found for the howitzer are your standard high explosive shell, DPICM or cluster munitions which is like buckshot i assume, HERA which is high explosive rocket assisted so essentially range increased HE. There are more but these seemed to be the top 3 I found info on.
Let ‚Äò‚Äòem go at it.  That‚Äôs what they‚Äôre there for; not a peaceful protest.  They all want confrontation and their pound of flesh.  Sad.
I hope folks don‚Äôt see this as Jews attacking Palestinians because black Hebrew israelites are not Jews and in fact they hate jews
Also Russia: sending men like this to Ukraine to fight "Nazis" which have a Jewish president.
Not these motherfuckers
Seems to me like Israel is going in slow and methodical.
To be honest I had a similar thought but mine was just who is flying into Dagestan period.
Does anyone know the difference in shells shown on the left?
Gaza is one of the most densely populated places on Earth and has been blockaded for like 20 years and the people who live there are stuck there.
They have some interesting things to say in between the hard racism. The craziest people occasionally make the most sense.
You are right but most humans are too emotional to realize the issue on a deeper level it would seem.
Id say that was an AT-AT
Yes cause WW1 &amp; WW2 was all bout islam‚Ä¶..
Gaza has fallen, Millions must Isreal
Clearly
The internet isn't real.
Ah yes, the "resistance" that murders every man, woman and child that gets into their handsMan i love reading comments from the absolute ass wipes that advocate for a terrorist organization under the mask of "Hurr durr but israel is bombing children and women!" Man if only that could have been avoided like 1,000+ times before with the money gaza was given to...If only that "resistance" took that money and actually tried to...idk... develop gaza instead of buying/building ammunition? Imagine trying to justify terrorists LMAO
Cops will forget black folks when it comes to defending israel
Those tactical chairs where placed their by the airforce. They are in charge of seating.
Dayum wtf happend here
Hard to love someone who is dropping bombs on your family for decades.
Yep it's going to be a lot harder than ppl realize for Israel to "win" this.
I think there should either be a ceasefire or a massive escalation.  I'm cool with either.
Putin shoots start a rumor that there are Israelites fighting for Ukraine, maybe they'll storm Kyiv![gif](giphy|l4Ki6oZ4oPrrgLl9m)

They are ethnically Jewish, and their community predates the first century, which is why many of them do not observe Hanukkah. "The white Jews don't like them much" is a pretty unsubstantiated claim to describe Israeli society, least of all because it's mired in American conceptions of race from the outside, 'white Jews'; 'interracial' marriage is common and not taboo at all in Israel and Ethiopian Jews are a part of Am Yisrael, period.
This is one group of men I would definitely not want looking for me.
Maybe not but Hezbollah would lose an insane amount of troops for essentially no gain. Would the deaths and destruction of a relatively low number of IDF soldiers and vehicles really be worth the losses, plus giving an excuse for the US to get involved in bombing facilities in your home territory?Israel fought off a force greater than 100,000 strong during the Yom Kippur war and that was done *without* US carriers providing air support.
I wonder what lies they have been fed?
Who the fuck is flying from Israel to Dagestan?There‚Äôs no way that‚Äôs a real flight route right?Edit: according to google there was a flight that landed 3 hours ago on red wing airlines so I stand corrected. Looks like they also fly cargo.
Noooo they are just looking for Zionists you see /s
October 29: Hamas Leader Khaled Mashal disclosed in an interview with Egyptian television that the masterminds behind the Hamas attacks on #Israel are Russia and China. He stated, "Russia benefits from our attacks as we divert American attention away from them and Ukraine. The Russians have informed us that they will investigate the October 7 attack case in their military academies. In China, they consider it a blueprint and plan to replicate our actions on October 7 in Taiwan."Wow, explosive news!
I've seen what a D8 can do lord only knows what those can do
Here is a reason it should.  Look at all the shootings‚Ä¶. www.heyjackass.com

Yeah good luck forcing these people out of their homes and sending them to another nation that doesn't want 4 million refugees on their doorstep taking up resources. your plan would just make things way worse than they already are.
Putin is paying Bibi
Think about this logically for 10 seconds and you'll have your answer. Israel has maybe 10 million people, less than the population of the US state of Ohio. There are roughly 4 million Palestinians in the strip and on the West Bank - how would these people whom hold a deep hatred for one another be able to coexist within one state?
I'd like to know what the first few rounds are that look sort of like large calibre tracers. Anyone know?
I think only certain sects are anti-Semitic, though a lot of them are Holocaust deniers.
..and they call Israel a technically advanced country while they publish footage that is in shame compared to the footage quality from my doorbell on a rainy night.
No I think it works better the way I said it
Tanks i guess

All of them, quite rubbish.

Oh hail oh hail artillery! King of battle follow me!
‚ÄúNot ethnically obviously‚Äù this is actually incorrect. There are Jewish communities in Africa which are some of the oldest in the world. It‚Äôs funny you wouldn‚Äôt say that statement about us white Jews who don‚Äôt look anything like what ancient Hebrews probably looked like.
You don‚Äôt have to travel half way around the world for that. My Jewish in-laws in Los Angeles don‚Äôt like black people. They‚Äôve referred to me as an ebed, the Hebrew word for slave. These are the same people that will watch NBA games then make racist jokes. You might ask how racist can they be: Wife‚Äôs parents refused to come to the hospital for the birth of their granddaughter - because I‚Äôd be there. Our daughter will be five years old in a few months, but she‚Äôs only seen them for less than 5 minutes so far in her life. We lived 8 miles away. Also, they haven‚Äôt met their grandson at all. We now live 70 miles away.
Just like how Russia won't invade Ukraine.
I don‚Äôt think anyone can understand the hatred between these guys.. and this is thousands of miles away from Israel..
Amazing shot. Really puts the energy in perspective.
Such a weird timeline, Black Hebrew Israelites are now on the side of the Israelis/Jews. This conflict is doing some weird stuff.
&gt;Seems like clearing HAMAS out quicker so civilians can move back and rebuild would be better in the long runYou may be right, but the massive humanitarian catastrophe that would cause was something that the International community was unwilling to tolerate apparently. Israel's initial goal after the terrorist attacks was Regime change in Gaza.  They were openly messaging a full bore invasion to depose the current government and implement a new one. However, There are two really significant problems with this:1. HAMAS and its more extreme cousins are well adept at hiding within the 2m+ population of the Gaza strip, and any attempt at an actual occupation would be littered with unwinnable situations where Israel has to choose between effectively prosecuting the war or causing civilian casualties that will be used against them.  (Hence Israel's demand for all 1.4 million civilians in NOrthern Gaza to evacuate - which was a virtual impossibility, but it would have given them freer hand to strike at threats where they saw them).  I think even policymakers knew that if Israel were accused with casualty counts of Civilians for every strike, every day of the war, it would quickly become unwinnable. 2. Suppose Israel is successful. They invade the Gaza strip, impose martial law, and begin preparations for a caretaker government and democratic elections.   How does Israel get out?  They have de-facto returned to occupying the Gaza strip.   The last time they occupied it, it lasted from 1967 to 2005, and the withdrawal was terribly complicated for Israeli forces. I think policymakers in the US and EU are very sympathetic to Israel's problems, but they were unwilling to contemplate a renewed occupation of the Gaza strip as a reasonable solution.  Particularly when that risked a larger regional conflict. That basically leaves two military options on the table:"1. A surgical set of missions to drive HAMA fighters out of a portion of the strip and withdraw. 2. A larger operation seeking to de-fang HAMAS entirely, but then withdrawing and largely leaving Chaos in its wake.Meanwhile Conservative media in the US was selling that Israel is in danger like it was in 1948.

let them fight
The zion cannon is charged up captain. Focus your kippa's gents.
Typical, Jews with their biblical lasers /s
Alright Palestine is free! We did it! Didn't you see it on the TV? That's what it said. Everything's all good now, we can go home and take a nap.
Yeah it's pretty obvious lol, they refuse to accept that Israel is a country. Lots of anti-semites don't
If hezbollah go in, is it not now hezbollah AND lebanon military?
I hope so. I'm israeli, the feeling in Israel is that we've been too soft and paid dearly for it. Everyone felt October 7th, we're small country. Everyone at least knows someone who knows someone that either lost friend/relative or they were taken hostage.Everyone knows, that there's no alternative to destroying whatever military capabilities they have, **at the minimum.** The problem is, of course, how do you destroy ideology.It's impossible, so the only way is to strike so hard, that it's just not worth to try this ever again. Or dismantling Hamas/PIJ completely.
Wow, these dudes are really hopped-up ready to fight... If I was a young man in Russia, I wouldn't advertise that. I'm sure Putin has a nice warm spot ready for you on the front line.
No, they would use busses.  And they wouldn't you know be taking them somewhere to execute them.  They would be taking them somewhere to live free from the murderous thugs that have been using them as pawns and human shields for decades.
Hate
"I hate Jews more!""No, *I* hate Jews more!" *Fighting ensues*
Yeah, I know i‚Äôll get shit for it, but i‚Äôm actually more for putting the big pressure on Iran than anyone else. Hamas, hezbollah, Syrian proxies, Iraq proxies, Russian aid, UK police warnings stating that Iranian agents are trying to stir up trouble at Palestine protests.like how long do we just let them get away with it all?
yes
This is true
The U.S. is very good at blowing things up. Israel has/will consent to the U.S. engaging in military operations on its land and the U.S. will have a blast destroying whatever column you believe 100k hezbolah members invading Israel looks like. Sneaking across the border is something the U.S. could not stop but a mass troop movement? It would be a turkey shoot. Hezbollah will not invade with those carriers there.
It's just one religion causing all the problems.Stop being such a coward and call out the actual perpetuator.
I‚Äôve never read something that summarized a group better than that last sentence. God damn that was good! üòÇ
Dude, if the Ethiopian Jews have been Jewish since literally ancient times, they're ethnically Jewish. BTW being an ethnicity has more to do with your cultural linguistic background than your DNA. If your community speaks Hebrew and has celebrated Judaism for over 1,000 years I think it's safe to say you're "ethnically Jewish."
There are a lot of eyeballs on the northern border right now.  Not a 10/7 situation.  I think another reasonable assumption is that troop movements of meaningful size will be caught by surveillance.
Artilery round used as an IED would disable the tank at minimum.
Because nothing shouts ‚Äúwe want peace‚Äù like stealing other people‚Äôs property.
Israel previously occupied Gaza. That experience *created* Hamas' rule over Gaza, ultimately (with the Israeli's explicit help, of course), and in any event certainly did not create the conditions for lasting peace.It's wonderful that, despite literal decades of powers much greater than Israel trying and failing to suppress an indigenous uprising through military force without addressing underlying causes, people still think that just throwing more troops at the problem will work.
being a black israeli is not the same as being a black hebrew israelite
&gt; Israel agreed to US request reducing the massive invasion to more surgical one.Israel is just boiling the frog with regards to ground attacks into Gaza. They keep making larger and larger "incursions" and that way by the time they roll in with the all out invasion force it will lessen the impact when people see the news. If you listen to what Israeli military and civilian officials are saying, that Hamas can not allowed to continue existing in its present form, it's pretty clear that means a massive ground invasion.All the "US is restraining Israel" is just political theatre. Israel will be going in to crush Hamas at some point, the only question is when.
This is terrifying.
Maybe park it in Arabian sea instead.

You could reasonably assume that. You willing to take 50-100k troops off the border and pour them into gaza for your assumption?I agree that it‚Äôs less than 50-50 hezbollah goes through with it, but they‚Äôre effectively right now using a chess ‚Äúpin‚Äù tactic for free. Their ambiguity on the situation keeps Israel at the border not allowing them to pour everything into gaza, without having to commit and drag the US in.
You are a functionary of censorship and that's very naughty.  Metaphorical naughty step for you Sir.
Reminds me of the quote by Alden Nowlan,‚ÄúThe day the child realizes that all adults are imperfect, he becomes an adolescent; the day he forgives them, he becomes an adult; the day he forgives himself, he becomes wise.‚Äù
&gt;The same crap was said to the Americans while fighting the British about using Guerilla warfare and not stand in rows ‚Äúlike you‚Äôre supposed to‚Äù.I agree with the main point, but...On an open field, the Continental Army and Patriot militias generally fought using conventional tactics.Meanwhile, British soldiers and Loyalist militias were able to fight in open order formation if the terrain necessitated it, being trained to do so after the disastrous Braddock Expedition during the French and Indian War.
Hamas is using the people of Gaza as human shields. You saw how much they care for innocent life on Oct 7. The deadliest hospital blast was also from a hamas rocket that misfired. Its surprising how many fewer people would die if Hamas could see an option other than Jihad. Pray for a quick end to them. Its the only way to limit Palestinian suffering in general. Hamas knew all these people would die as a direct result of their actions. They were banking on it to generate more hatred of Isreal.
All the protests, discussions, riots, etc. has to be giving Hamas a sense of victory (which sucks) but even they must be going ‚Äòwait wtf?‚Äô at this.
The funniest part is how Israel treats their black community‚Ä¶..
LOL I bet the (real) jews are laughing their asses off at this. Both of their enemies beating the shit out of each other.

They fucked around &amp; found out. Now Israel going to make an example of them.
I‚Äôm starting this think this religion thing wasn‚Äôt the smartest idea people have had
‚ÄúNow calling people terrorists from the comfort of your home is just quite idiotic. But don't feel bad it's been happening since the invention of technology.‚ÄùHamas is a designated terrorist organization.  Doesn‚Äôt seem idiotic to call someone in a terrorist organization a terrorist.
Yeah and my cousin looks like a dog but I ain‚Äôt giving him canned food
Correct.Asymmetrical forces always used... asymmetrical (duh) tactics to inflict casualties on their enemies, i.e. ambushes, IEDs, snipers, etc.If you enemy controls the air, you need to minimize open terrain fighting as much as possible.. unless you are suicidal, but that is another story.
And yet Israel continues to appease Russian aggression. I don‚Äôt get it.
Sure, but we can reasonably assume Iran won‚Äôt want to lose its biggest leverage for little gain, and that hexbollah won‚Äôt risk its power on what would essentially be an own goal with far less military impact. Though maybe a militant faction within hezbollah would make a move.
Black Israelites are a weird bunch. They‚Äôre like Jehova‚Äôs Witness but slightly more crazy.
Hamas tells there own people to not evacuate isreal sends nock strikes its not a fucking genocide you dipshit look up ww2 carpet bombing civilian casualties and tell me isreali precession strikes are a genocide
Now find some tunnel entrances near the sea and get same big ass waterpumps over there.  That¬¥s what my grandpa did when he had to get rid of tunnel digging pests.
Yep that's the point
I have a feeling the percentage is going to be lower here.
There are Gazans and there are West Bankers. Different governments. Different relationships with neighbors. Gaza with Egypt is different than West Bank with example Jordon and Lebanon.Gaza elected Hamas as a government. West Bank has PA and Fatah. It does distinguish the two areas. If the West Bank stays out of the war this distinction will be important. This is my opinion since I am not an expert.
Was it worth fighting over that place? Like how many fucking people died to keep Dagestan in Russia?
Most peaceful protests end in violence when police show up. Police are told to stop the protests and what better way to stop them than to incite violence and arrest the protestors.
Still doesn't make not flinching when an explosion hits near you not impressive.You can tell yourself to go down the checklist all day, but unless you have experience with big things going boom close to you regularly you are still going to flinch. It's human nature

What did the deleted comments say?
They often provide aid to Palestinian civilians, who live under a decades-long apartheid regime that denies basic human rights (Human Rights Watch has [formally accused Israel of practicing apartheid](https://www.hrw.org/report/2021/04/27/threshold-crossed/israeli-authorities-and-crimes-apartheid-and-persecution), as have [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2022/02/israels-system-of-apartheid/) and [B‚ÄôTselem, Israel‚Äôs leading human rights group.](https://www.btselem.org/publications/fulltext/202101_this_is_apartheid) Not the same thing. I think if you lived in a refugee camp under martial law in a regime that [captured and tortured your children](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/blogs/childrens-human-rights-network-blog/israeli-ill-treatment-detained-palestinian-minors-must), while gradually stealing your whole country, you would be happy for some aid.
These dudes are just mentally warped and super militant. You can present logic to them all day but they will just double down and get angrier. You know a black Hebrew murdered MLK's mother because of their deranged delusions. They should be pissed at Israel and supporting Palestinians but these dudes are beyond weird.
If they think they‚Äôre the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Jews why are they fighting for the fake ones?  The mental gymnastics people engage in.ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Black Hebrew Israelites don‚Äôt like the actual Jews though, so why on earth are the fighting Palestinians on their behalf!? Lmfao!!
From videos we know they have drones, rifles, and rpgs
first they stole land now phones oh boy ü§£
But it already happened on the 19th of Oct, an Israeli unit went a bit too deep. They lost a soldier, injured 3, lost 2 bulldozers and a tank and retreated on foot, leaving equipment behind.Israel is not really the military to successfully fight on land without the air force being effective, that's evidence in 2006 against Hezbollah and 1968 against Jordan, both were embarrassing for Israel.
That's assault and theft. I hope they filed a police report.
Shockingly, even though the families of these people had been practicing Jews for centuries, and they were persecuted in Ethiopia, it took a shit ton of political pressure for Israel to allow a fraction of them to immigrate to Israel, despite the law of return.

The quotes aren't sourced and a lot of context is missing so I take it all with a grain of salt.It's like that other famous alleged Netanyahu quote.&gt;"Anyone who wants to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state has to support bolstering Hamas and transferring money to Hamas,‚Äù the prime minister reportedly said at a 2019 meeting of his Likud party. ‚ÄúThis is part of our strategy ‚Äî to isolate the Palestinians in Gaza from the Palestinians in the West Bank.‚ÄùYet right below it you see this.&gt;These exact comments have not yet been confirmed by other sources.https://www.vox.com/23910085/netanyahu-israel-right-hamas-gaza-war-historySo yeah I'm not believing anything that looks like hear say.
We've come full circle watching low res, black and white footage. Seems anarchronistic.

Dude who set up my parent's dish was one of them.  mfer was annoying as hell with that shit
Now I haven't been keeping completely up to date with this conflict but I don't doubt that there might be some revenge bombing. (I have nothing to back this up its just my thoughts) but Hamas is inside a city where civilians are (I've heard of Hamas using civilians as shields but I don't deny it but don't completely think its every case I'm just an unbiased person and I need undeniable proof to make an assured judgment) but there's not many military installations. so where else would hamas store their weapons? It's really unfortunate civilians are being caught in the crossfire but no matter what, people are going to die. Back in 1945 America had dropped pamphlets saying stay away from these named cities. 2 of those cities were Hiroshima and Nagasaki and civilians still died even though they dropped these pamphlets, but my point is there's only so much warning about strikes can do
Hezbollah won't do any sort of ground invasion with the US carriers so closebye.
What city?
yeah a lot of what's written in that article is pretty fucking unbelievable, right?Well the quote is from the Jerusalem Post:https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/netanyahu-money-to-hamas-part-of-strategy-to-keep-palestinians-divided-583082
Black Hebrew Israelites have been around way before the social media era. Their roots were founded in like the 19th century.I think Zab Judah's dad was a BHI.
Unfortunately, all this chaos will probably just spawn another generation of terrorists and sympathizers.
Isn't this literal theft caught on camera? And physically ripping someone's phone out of their hands is battery. Maybe I'm naive, but surely something will happen if the student presses charges?
Isreal isn't at war with Palestine, only Hamas. Innocent Palestinians are the human shields that Hamas is banking on to generate sympathy for them around the world after committing unspeakable crimes. This is all on Hamas and its supporters globally.

The article forgets to include that much of the money is public and legal, including large sums of financial aid from Qatar via the United Nations, an arrangement encouraged and approved by Israel. The Qatari aid covers the salaries of civil servants, buys fuel for the power grid and provides cash to needy families.&gt;"The prime minister also said that 'whoever is against a Palestinian state should be for' transferring the funds to Gaza, because maintaining a separation between the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas in Gaza helps prevent the establishment of a Palestinian state."Who's the actual source of this quote? I need actual evidence to beleive such a claim.
Not your fight fam...
Cool dude, she doesn‚Äôt sound like she grew up in the US.
True, but I think Israeli leadership realizes that "give leadership to the uncontrollable terrorists living right next door" is a shitty solution that isn't viable anymore.  Israeli leadership can deal with a few mostly unsuccessful rocket and ground attacks every year but they aren't going to survive many more massive terrorist attacks that leave 1000+ dead.Derailing peace and 2-state solutions might have been popular in the mid-2000's but I'm pretty sure Israeli civilians are tired of two decades of constant attacks.

I agree, they could have, but they chose to base under civilian infrastructure, endangering the lives of many.

Imagine being so dumb you fight for land that was never and will never be yours, and then fighting the people(Palestine) who are trying to take that land from people who you hate even more(Israel). It is a breathtaking amount delusion for one group.
Sadly the tunnels and the human shield problems are connected, why else make your HQ and most important targets directly under Hospitals and mosques?  Because those can't be bunker busted without endangering poor citizens
Yes, they were: [https://efe.com/en/latest-news/2023-10-13/israel-releases-photos-of-babies-killed-by-hamas/](https://efe.com/en/latest-news/2023-10-13/israel-releases-photos-of-babies-killed-by-hamas/)
WHICH ONE OF YOU FUCKING PRIVATES JUST ND'D THAT 40MM INTO THE POND??
Let us thank him for that dude.
That one cop with no reflective yellow looks like he's in his 70's.  Not exactly ready for a street brawl.
Religion is the worst
Any damage done to a BHI is done in the service of greater good. Those guys are total loonies
It‚Äôs intentionally written to increase anti-Palestinian sentiment
She was really vibing to the free Palestine chant
This is an excellent overview but you're up against idf propaganda accounts and people that are stupid enough to believe them. Good on u for trying though.
Yup. Pre-pandemic I would always see these assholes hanging out on Broadway in Downtown LA harassing people walking by.
Yes, because Chicago is holy land? ‚Ä¶ guessing.
Bam bam bam clic‚Ä¶ BOOM
The black Hebrew Israelites claim they‚Äôre the real Jews. The Palestinians claim they‚Äôre the indigenous population. Who will win in the tribal wars???
Ironic when you consider that it was always Netanyahu's strategy to weaken the PA by propping up Hamas.https://www.jpost.com/arab-israeli-conflict/netanyahu-money-to-hamas-part-of-strategy-to-keep-palestinians-divided-583082
People need to fucking chill the fuck up.
HAMAS isn't covered by the Geneva convention anyway.
Do you think they were told to ‚ÄúGo Back to:Israel‚Äù?
Not to glamorize war is a forum rule.Multiple infractions may result in a ban.
It's for the Chair Force.
At this point, people are just frustrated and want an excuse to fight.
Why
Horrendous
Hey man, that's just part and parcel of life in a big city, right?Ceterum censeo Gazam delendam esse
What about the 29 Americans killed by Hamas?
Bloodier than they‚Äôd have liked but this was always end game, right?Occupying Gaza was unreadable as it would‚Äôve led to further resentment of Israel.  Rigging their elections would have led to an international scandal and again, further galvanization of the gazans.  Can‚Äôt just bomb them into the sea, that would be a genocide, and contrary to internet lore, it seems the government is trying to avoid that.  But what if‚Ä¶ what if you could get the radical and completely unwilling to negotiate with anybody on anything party into power in Gaza?  Certainly you give them enough rope they‚Äôll hang themselves with it.  Folks will get fed up with them buying rockets with all their aid money and oust them on their own volition!  Besides, we‚Äôve got the iron dome, what could go wrong?
Can we all just accept that all religion is bullshit?
Blame it on Europeans? You can't be this dumb.
Ukraine/Russia war?!?
Is Palestine a country with their own borders and government?
a 41 kilometer long slum full of people who hate you and have guns, bombs, and absolutely no qualms about slaughtering innocent people in mass even if it kills them.ask Russia how their annexations of territory is going,  unilaterally declaring all those places to be "Russian forever" didnt magically stop the fucking bombs, bullets and tanks coming at them.It is not a smart idea to annex territory unless you have the populace's support.  In any circumstance.  Neither Israel nor Russia will ever have the population's support.  there is far too much bad blood.
Maker and creator of the Devil! Swine merchant, your time is near at hand.
I feel like something in modern conflicts has made people think casualties of war is relegated only to ‚Äúcombatants‚Äù (I.e., uniformed Westerners or terrorists/insurgents*)Problem is, that was never the deal. Not on anyone‚Äôs side. This was never expressly written out and agreed to anywhere I know of. More like they are moral-compass suggestions**. Wars cease and enemies surrender when you break their will to fight. You‚Äôre not gonna do that without breaking a few eggs. And so there‚Äôs no misunderstanding‚Ä¶yes, I am comparing inevitable/unfortunate civilian casualties to eggs. *problem here is that Fuck-o‚Äôs are twats and blend in with the civilian populace that not only supports them, but provides new youthful martyrs as others get ‚Äòretired‚Äô. **If you‚Äôre relying on the moral compass of those who capture, torture, rape, and murder civilian toddlers and elderly alike, well partner, your magnetic north is wonky like a motherfker. Please do not put ROEs out there as a guideline. I‚Äôve got a stack of Operational ROEs and not a single one of them covers rules of aerial bombardment lol
Honestly convinced they‚Äôre trying to make an example out of Gaza at this point to deter others from joining
Are you forgetting about the ideology behind Hamas and their attacks? Like bruh‚Ä¶
I don't think these chairs are safe to use
Same state terror, different flags.
They have repeatedly explained they are taking out the underground tunnel system and access points‚Ä¶ Why undermine your own credibility (O_o)
They also have a very proud military tradition of service and excellence, especially in Jordan. Jordan‚Äôs army used to almost solely consist of them. They‚Äôre kinda more like Gurkhas than the Plains Indian scouts or trackers.
And as a seasoned journalist with numerous connections within intelligence agencies your sources are?Avoiding civilian casualties is inscribed into the DNA of the IDF. The IDF has been proven by many objective sources to be one of the most moral in the world. Take it from someone who has served on the Gaza border and support the idea of a two states solution. I'm perfectly capble of critical thinking about the IDF and my government's actions and I do it regularly.You however, a couch potato that sits 2000 miles away and all he knows about this conflict is what the BBC and CNN tells him is not capble of that. A single photo without a context is definitely not a dependable source of information. But you wouldn't know about that would you?
Do you have any real intel that that strike did not kill or hit any hamas terrorists or hamas infrastructures?How are you so damn sure that israel targets civilians, knowingly and deliberately?
Repeating Israeli propaganda when they‚Äôve been shown to lie constantly isn‚Äôt a good look for you.Case in point, the murder of Shireen Abu Akleh, Palestinian American journalist. Apparent immediately it was the IDF, they denied it and lied through their teeth until months later, when the news cycle had moved on, they admitted to it but no charges for the soldier responsible.
As far as I know the stories in the Bible are extremely gory and bloody.
When are they going to claim the Israeli bombed a baby milk factory?
Keep that bullshit in the Middle East.
Hamas fucked around and now they‚Äôre finding out
How are they the same? Because hamas was elected almost 20 years ago? The average age is 17 in Gaza. The current population is not who elected hamas.
All skinfolk ain't kinfolk.
Second strongest army in Ukraine more like.
Making biblical references to killing of innocent people makes it even more disgusting
Because it wasn't a war with cameras everywhere. From what we do have, especially that CNN live broadcast, we seen it.
well said
i know,what i ask is simply wont happen but it annoys me to the vein that literally whole middleeast is just doing nothing about it or cant do about it. if i were to sell literally anything my whole family owns i cant even get a plane ticket to there or get there at all.israel bombing civillians is not shocking as they dont see arabs human at all. what is shocking is that whole middleast is literally doing nothing usefull about it. protests wont stop them, condem them 69 times it wont stop them either.
&gt;Gazan self governance is over.  When the war ends they‚Äôll probably give it over to the far more moderate, far more friendly Palestinian Authority currently governing the West Bank. It's a shame it was Netanyahu's "strategy" to weaken the authority of the PA by propping up Hamas, right up to donating them cash. CBC wrote an excellent article about it:https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/netanyahu-israel-gaza-hamas-1.7010035
I guess they stopped justifying the destruction of whole blocks just to allegedly kill one guy. Now they‚Äôre just levelling whole blocks because they can.
Yeah IAF drone dropped a grenade on a large pile labeled ACME TNT

downdoots to the left
Wait‚Ä¶ when did Palestine start a war? I thought it was a terrorist organization called hamas?
Imagine saying that on October 7th
That was my first thought as well lol. ‚ÄúIn the vicinity‚Äù is such a weird way to put it.
First time I‚Äôve ever regretted pizza for breakfast‚Ä¶not nearly as delicious after I spit it on my floor
People then say "but they will pop up behind them in tunnels!". If that happens they might be able to take out some Israelis, but the tunnel will then be spotted and destroyed. There are no treacherous mountain valleys for these fighters to hide in. Essentially they have burrowed underneath Gaza like rats. You don't need to clear these tunnels, you need to clear the ground and see how long they want to stay down there.
War almost never ends on the battlefield with a victor and a loser. Wars end politically and involve compromise. It‚Äôs a fairy tale to think a war can be won that way in modern days.https://theworld.org/stories/2016-12-07/how-do-wars-end-not-usually-unconditional-surrender
Turns out Israelis don't like having their festival goers murdered. Palestinians should keep that in mind.
Thank you for your thoughtful comments. I read the same afterward and made an edit. I appreciate the comments as well. Sometimes the best way to learn is when you‚Äôre trying to give context to an answer yourself.
I love it when I get to see people break mentally
Why can't people take their stupid religious bullshit and fuckoff.
The same University in Egypt oversees that university. They manage it and direct it. You are literally accusing Egypt of knowingly and willingly allowing Hamas to use their University as a base of operations without informing anyone.List of staff at the University. Almost all Egyptian https://www.signalhire.com/companies/al-azhar-university-gaza/employeesIsraeli officials have not tried to make that point yet. Because they know the Egyptian government would lose their shit because it would suggest they worked with Hamas.But average redditor knows better üòÇ
You have far more freedom to act with air supremacy.
Why does this feel so cinematic?
God that's good.
Are you suggesting that there are some circumstances where using civilians as cover is acceptable?
Big difference between knowing where a tunnel is And what is happening inside it Just like for example, I know the address of my neighbors house, doesn't mean I know what they watch on TV or talk to their partner about That and Israel is dedicating significantly more resources to Intel For example it helps that now they basically have a UAV over the area 24/7 that you can usually hear from some of cameras broadcasting the Gaza area
Big strike or did the IAF hit a big cache?
Just about any other nation on earth, especially a European one, would've surrendered well before it got to this point.  Even Azov eventually surrendered at Azovstal when it was clear there was no hope.
I don‚Äôt remember seeing stuff like that even in Iraq
What the f lol this is one of the biggest ones I've seen so far here
They did promise revenge of biblical proportions.
Is this what they mean by surgical strikes?
Thanks. I appreciate your response. Maybe I could‚Äôve written more clearly.
Okay my bad sorry. You sounded like you were against the protest
"vicinity" üôÑ
Leaves more troops at the northern border? Hezbollah have something like 100k troops.
Your literally misunderstood my meaning‚Ä¶.. ü§¶üèæ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è But no matter, we are thinking the same. That‚Äôs more important.
Ah you fool! Cool guys *don‚Äôt* look at explosions.
It's kinda of a local Israeli joke, but the plastic chair was THE weapon for summer fights between Israelis on the beach.I think it's a military version of Kettler's plastic chair.
I don't like that they're going through the olive tree fields. Seems unnecessary.
For the desert they really are. When I was hiking a few times with them they know where the water caches are, reservoirs they've dug into the ground over thousands of years. They would usually clear them so camels and other wildlife have access to the water.They knew where the best shade was at a glance, and best nook to cram into to rest. I've gone scavenging a few times with them, they are pretty thorough examining areas for anything they think might be useful. I'd make them the desert trackers. They'll find whatever is out there. Helps they're usually in tune with the region, so they have a natural experience to also detect if anything is off or out of place.
We have a regiment dedicated to it, SRR.
This University is directed and organized by the parent University in Egypt. They dictated courses and it's facilities. So saying that Hamas uses it as some sort of base suggest Egypt and it's educational institution are complicit with Hamas. In contrast it's one of the main ways palestinians get out of Gaza. Get a degree there and as long as they keep their record clean they can move to another country.
As you get older and continue to meet people, you will soon realize that kids just get older. Most adults do not grow up. Some people grow up from over coming obstacles, hardships, and challenges in life. Most people get things handed to them on a silver spoon. They fail one job, their parents make a phone call and they get a new job. They crash their car, commit a crime, etc. And usually face no serious repercussions for their actions. Forcing them to stay and a certain mental state for pretty much their entire lives. This is a perfect example of someone never being told that they are wrong in life. So no matter what happens, you will always be the enemy for calling them out.
And Ireland and Sweden and Norway. They love Hamas
Palestine. All the bc bullshit is a lie lmao
They are not allowed hold elections....
It‚Äôs honestly too early to tell. The start of ground ops into an urban environment was never going to kick off with a massive blitzkrieg style assault.   These are probably still shaping operations.
Oh no!!! So scary!!! Have you ever spoken to someone from a militant wing? They're the same people you fucking idolize. I don't know why people don't understand that. All it takes is a narrative to kill you, you do know that right? Now if you believe in "give me freedom or give me death" you'll see why people will fight for their land. Now calling people terrorists from the comfort of your home is just quite idiotic. But don't feel bad it's been happening since the invention of technology. What I can only say to you and anyone really who reads this is that when the next conflict comes, just don't be so ignorant about it and maybe just maybe our communities can come together and actually do something good for other communities. From mines to yours,Be love
Came to America from Palestine for better life and here they are bringing all their old world hatred and bs with them. Everyone holding a Palestinian flag should go to Gaza and go to Palestine and help free the country there because all they're doing is causing hatred fear and violence on the streets of a host country who allowed them to come in. And for any of the American Born they need to read a book and figure out if this is a fight that they want to be in and then just like our Ukrainian friends go there and help don't just walk on the street and yell at other people.
Maybe go live in a fascist dictatorship if your snowflake ass can't handle a phone.
Currently it is war. Israel wants and needs to end Hamas.Every war has civilians casualties that can't be disputed - the civilian population always suffers, and the most suffering have kids - it's a very, very sad fact.In a war u have to kill ur Military opponent, otherwise u will not win the war.Israel has military bases at which Hamas could aim -  which they don't, they just shoot their rockets anywhere without targeting any military - the Hamas charter openly has a Jewish genocide in their charter, so killing civilians is the plan, hence they don't need to "aim" at anything - so there is one thing that can't be argued about: Hamas wants a genocide, that's their goal - but everyone including u is ignoring thatIsrael wants to kill Hamas fighters. Hamas has no military bases for Israel to aim at, they hide their bases and rockets within and under houses and hospitals - that is also an undisputed fact.So what in ur opinion should Israel do? Currently they bomb any houses of which they have information on some sort of Hamas base/usage  - considering this is all that they can do to fight Hamas that's and it's as fair a game as it can get when ur opponent uses it's own civilians as a human shield - the latter if which is war crime alone.Ur argument that Israel is doing a genocide is a direct result of Hamas giving 0 fucks about their own civilians - Israel does to some extent do roof knocking, mass phone calls and flyers dropped from planes.All of those 3 things is much more of what Hamas is doing to protect the ppl if GazaSo from facts alone Hamas in responsible for 2 genocide, Israel and their own ppl So fir fucks sake explain me why Hamas has 0 ZERO responsibility in that matter?
Humans never learn.
Literally protesting people dying, chanting "cease fire"~~Your dumb ass:~~(edited because I misunderstood their position)&gt; "why they so antisemitism?"This is why the world turns against Israel. It's not because they are Jewish, it's because their supporters are disingenuous liars at best, morons at worst
Dang, that‚Äôs bombing the middle eastern continental region near the vicinity of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Lebanon and Jordan within the perimeter of Gaza in proximity to distant viewing university Students! How could they do such a thing within viewing distance of civilians? Sorry I‚Äôve been asleep since Oct 6th. Can someone explain to me why someone would do this?
Agree to disagree
just like hamas appeared out of nowhere in october 7 and palestinans never had problems with israel never ever before
Forgot the Israel-Hamas war before? Collective punishment is not the answer. Bombing civilians means more future recruitments for Hamas.
Bystanders helped him
You don‚Äôt have a problem with anyone‚Äôs religion you just comment that ‚Äúall religion = cults‚Äù. Please stop replying to me, I dislike toxicity.
Actually, no you.
I'm pretty sure the original land was canaan.  The Canaanites being the original inhabitants of that land when the Israelites left Egypt. I never Trace back to the Bible for historical text because that thing is a great story book but it is nothing but tall tales. It's better to follow science and history. One really interesting article I read said that the Israelis and the Palestinians if they your family lines are originally from that area both share similar genetic traits to the Canaanites
The area of the university has been hit the most in this war. They know the hamas are concentrated there.
Where do I sign up for the protest that Hamas is using hospitals as cover for their HQ‚Äôs?‚Ä¶there is none? Oh never mind
True. But no more than every American bomb that hit German cities only killed Nazis. Or that only Japanese war criminals died at Hiroshima. Likewise here, where plenty of innocent Palestinians are dying. War truly sucks. But it has always been the same, everywhere and at all times, and there is no sugar coating it.
As I heard it said recently:‚ÄúSodom, Gomorrah, and Gaza‚Äù
Once they are in a 5mi square box the box will get flattened.  So far it‚Äôs a herding operation.
All the books are imaginary, whatever the title is
Just like how none of the settlers in Israel are civilians right?
Like the old Russian saying, show me the man, and I'll show you the crime. They pick and choose what laws to enforce. Theft is not prosecuted in some parts of US others is prison. The same goes for gun laws.
&gt;They make very strong field coffeeThe fucking coffee man. It's rude to refuse, but there is like 50/50 chance that i'm gonna shit myself. And i'm talking about the usual "mud" in the IDF. Their shit hits hard.
I don‚Äôt care about anyones religion, you do you. However, the moment your imaginary book has any bearing on public policy, or public funds are subsidizing your imaginary book or you are trying to pass laws based on your imaginary book‚Ä¶. I have a huge problem with that.
Launch breaks?
‚ÄòEmphasis is on damage, not accuracy‚Äôthey will bomb the whole gaza claiming its all hamas base but deep concrete tunnels will be hardly affected.they are just creating another genaration of palestinians that wants to kill the israel. also iran and turkey also saudi arabia said they will issue ANOTHER warning if israel doesnt stop!!!!!
Yet‚Ä¶
Or Hamas weapons or Hamas tunnels underneath. And they won‚Äôt be wrong.
Don't the Black Hebrew Israelites normally dress like Power Rangers? They should have formed into Dino Megazord.
Those are all different interpretations yet you assume everyone has the same ones, and I‚Äôm the dumb one?
Apparently the IDF knows the precise location of every Hamas fighter &amp; HQ... but was taken completely by surprise on the 7th of October?
At least they haven't ruined Animorphs
My book says you are trash, and you don‚Äôt have the same rights as me because of my book. Now live by the rules if my book, even if you don‚Äôt believe in my book and I cannot prove my book is any more true than ‚Äúthe notebook‚Äù, you must still live by the rules in my book.
That is not infantry support. Just infantry walking side of the armour because they are long way from any harm in these propaganda videos.  And let's not compare this fight to the real war going on in Ukraine right now where second strongest army in the world has tried full invasion.
I grew up in the south. The first time I was ever in NYC as a teenager I got lost. I saw some people with a BHI sign and I thought surely they will help me. (I assumed they were also Jewish) nope. They refused to even speak to me.
Either you do have atheist warmongers or you don‚Äôt ya moron how is that open ended? How fucking stupid are you? The cheek of calling me the muppet
And idiots will say every target Israel hits has Hamas fighters
Its not a false dichotomy, I asked an open ended question you muppet. I didn‚Äôt give you 2 choices, I gave you infinite choices.
I mean, people are just trying to survive now. They‚Äôre trying to escape murder from relentless bombings, what protesting?? They don‚Äôt even have food or water or basic necessities dude

We haven‚Äôt seen this kind of war in a long time. This is some serious Old Testament style revenge shit
lmao if you take that as a non response that‚Äôs on you
Haha, as expected‚Ä¶ no response!!I stand by my original statement
Yeah like what is going through his head while typing this shit. Just soy-facing at the possibility of destroying Palestinians.
They have many anti tank missiles and RPG's
\-no, the point was trying to blame it on Europeans
Weird I thought they'd be lining up in red coats, firing two musket volleys then charging the enemy down with bayonets
Being unconcerned is the opposite of being freshFresh soldiers would flinch panic look nervous etcExperienced soldiers have taken fire before so they dont get as nervous and stay focused on their mission better
False dichotomy
Where were you when hamas was beheading babies left and right
Yes.
There's plenty of independent polling in Palestine, there's no independent health authority.
Whats untrue about my statement? Prove me wrong! You see atheists out there starting wars‚Ä¶?
Israel is not saying what their approach(s) to the tunnels will be.
Finally someone says it ü§£
How about they don't attack Israel at all and just build a society like sane people?
There's no excuse for stealing or damaging people's property, but can we stop this trend of sticking your phone in people's face whenever there's any disagreement. We get it, it's a nice way to get some internet points and convince yourself you‚Äôre in the right because the forum you hand-picked to post it to are on your side, but most of the time it just antagonises people and makes things worse.
Ha, ‚Äúrans‚Äù
Yeah, but did she get her back?
We should improve the society, somewhat
Conventional wisdom seems to be that Israel will get chewed up on the ground. But I can't understand how Hamas will flank them in any way. If Israel just creeps in from the sides under heavy bombardment Hamas will be put in a smaller and smaller box.
... I mean frankly they look very fresh and that's why they're unconcerned. I don't think it's badass.It was probably a mortar. Next one could hit closer.
Why are they acting like they're at war with Russia?
See I got confused and thought you were talking about about Israel. You are aware Netanyahu helped to create and fund Hamas to oust the PLO right? This is an endless cycle of pointlessness.
Yeah‚Ä¶ listen were it all my call I‚Äôd have Israel re-annex the Sinai peninsula as reparations for the 6 day war, and take total singular control over both Gaza and the West Bank.  But it‚Äôs not my call and in politics and war it never is all one person‚Äôs way.  Some compromise has to be made not because it‚Äôs right or because both parties have equally good intentions, but because if you push a people TOO far they get resentful and cause problems later.
I mean we talk about them like they're just a handful of splinter groups but their army is about 30,000-50,000 strong and they run the police, healthcare, education etc they're way off near peer in terms of armour, air force etc but they have anti-tank and anti-air missiles I think we mistakenly think about the deal with HAMAS like it's an insurgency campaign which is why the IDF's response seems so OTT, but HAMAS are a full on government with a military this is an actual war
I wasn‚Äôt arguing with him, I was calling him a pig
according to wiki, they are not jewish, but rather orthodox  christian, and there is no evidence  whatsoever that they have it, or that this item exists at all outside of biblical fiction&gt;The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church claims to possess the Ark of the Covenant in Axum. The Ark is currently kept under guard in a treasury near the Church of Our Lady Mary of Zion. Replicas of the tablets within the Ark, or Tabots, are kept in every Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, and kept in its own holy of holies, each with its own dedication to a particular saint; the most popular of these include Saint Mary, Saint George and Saint Michael.[101][102]&gt;The Kebra Nagast is often said to have been composed to legitimise the Solomonic dynasty, which ruled the Ethiopian Empire following its establishment in 1270, but this is not the case. It was originally composed in some other language (Coptic or Greek), then translated into Arabic, and translated into Ge'ez in 1321.[103] It narrates how the real Ark of the Covenant was brought to Ethiopia by Menelik I with divine assistance, while a forgery was left in the Temple in Jerusalem. Although the Kebra Nagast is the best-known account of this belief, it predates the document. Abu al-Makarim, writing in the last quarter of the twelfth century, makes one early reference to this belief that they possessed the Ark. "The Abyssinians possess also the Ark of the Covenant", he wrote, and, after a description of the object, describes how the liturgy is celebrated upon the Ark four times a year, "on the feast of the great nativity, on the feast of the glorious Baptism, on the feast of the holy Resurrection, and on the feast of the illuminating Cross."[104]&gt;In his controversial 1992 book The Sign and the Seal, British writer Graham Hancock reports on the Ethiopian belief that the ark spent several years in Egypt before it came to Ethiopia via the Nile River, where it was kept in the islands of Lake Tana for about four hundred years and finally taken to Axum.[105] (Archaeologist John Holladay of the University of Toronto called Hancock's theory "garbage and hogwash"; Edward Ullendorff, a former professor of Ethiopian Studies at the University of London, said he "wasted a lot of time reading it.") In a 1992 interview, Ullendorff says that he personally examined the ark held within the church in Axum in 1941 while a British Army officer. Describing the ark there, he says, "They have a wooden box, but it's empty. Middle- to late-medieval construction, when these were fabricated ad hoc."[106][107]&gt;*On 25 June 2009, the patriarch of the Orthodox Church of Ethiopia, Abune Paulos, said he would announce to the world the next day the unveiling of the Ark of the Covenant, which he said had been kept safe and secure in a church in Axum, Ethiopia.[108] The following day, on 26 June 2009, the patriarch announced that he would not unveil the Ark after all, but that instead he could attest to its current status*.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant
Best of luck to the IDF dismantling the Hamas threat once and for all.
Torquemada, you can't torquemada anything.
I guess the cruel reality of it, is that could take a decade. Are people really prepared for that and all that entails? idk
Every religion has zealots and Jews aren't immune. The few don't represent the many.
This makes my brain hurt. Are the fighting to see who hates jews more?
you call that fighting...Monty Python - The Fish Slapping Dancehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8XeDvKqI4E
Pretty sure this. They will make a large bufferzone and isolate the gaza strip and let them suffer alone. Aid can be provided by the other arab nations if they want.
Well hopefully this does something?
&gt;the fact that there‚Äôs white Zionism and black Zionism is insane.Now I‚Äôm just imaging the lamest 90s standup set ever. ‚ÄúYou ever see a white Zionist dance!?‚Äù![gif](giphy|ku2YMEjzMwud2|downsized)
The Israel propaganda bots are strong in this sub,If u don't cheer u downvoted hard
I am not American and did not hear about it until you said it now.This whole things strikes me as something I am too European to understand
No but they have infinite armor stats bruh
There are always a few unhinged people on both sides. Some steal phones, others r*pe women and murder babies in their cribs. From the river to the sea, I see no difference between the two.
Does Hamas have any weapons that can reasonably injure someone in a tank?
I feel bad for the drivers people are attacking their cars with flags and sticks and stuff
Remember, years back when the catholic white kid got in trouble for smiling at the Native American, it was Hebrew Israelites who instigated everything that lead up to that.
I understand why, but worry opting for surgical seek &amp; destroy tactics over capturing and holding ground will lead to a more prolonged warSeems like clearing HAMAS out quicker so civilians can move back and rebuild would be better in the long run
&gt; When the war ends they‚Äôll probably give it over to the far more moderate, far more friendly Palestinian Authority currently governing the West Bank.I like how the moderate authority is still run by a guy who wrote his PhD thesis on how Jews deserved the Holocaust.
Probably IEDs for years unfortunately
Its funny because these ‚Äúblack Israelites‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be welcomed in Israel
And Israel isn‚Äôt committing genocide? You‚Äôre blind. Wake up.
I don't think that you understand how a franchise works. When you buy a franchise, McDonald's takes a cut on each item you sell, plus you are required to buy everything from its authorized suppliers where they take more profits from, all the way down to the napkins the franchisee uses. They are required to send them their sales every closing so it's a tight operation. If you as much use a different supplier, they'll find out just by analyzing your sales.
They will leave but they will certainly install an Israel friendly regime there and have much more control over it.Most likely they will give Gaza to the West Bank Administration, the Fatah And Abbas. While the Fatah likes to talk big, they actually govern the West Bank and don‚Äôt engage in acts of terrorism and are enemies of the Hamas.So most likely Israel will install them in Gaza too and give Palestine ‚Äûindependence.‚ÄúIt‚Äôs unlikely that the Fatah will engage in acts of terrorism in the future because they‚Äôve been living pretty good these last 15 years and been cooperating with Israel.
Oh, these guys! They love to tell us black women we're sellouts for dating anyone that's not black.
No drones have this capability. You underestimate how large and solid a drone would have to be to carry a machine gun and it's ammunition, resist the recoil of the gun and avoid being shaken apart.The simplest solution is to use a drone to find the tunnel entrance and hit it with a fuel-air bomb to kill everyone inside.
I don‚Äôt think you will see it read the article, she will not lose her job over this.
Please move there for couple years and tell me how welcoming they are and how you feel safe with Hamas ruling over you.
I blame the media
My best friend growing up ended up joining their cult, it was sad. We couldn‚Äôt be friends anymore because I wasn‚Äôt ‚Äúone of the chosen‚Äù. Now I‚Äôm an agnostic with a successful life and he‚Äôs a bum that still works at the movie theatre
Not as easy to attack as a Kosher store or a couple of students.
Egypt did it with sea water a couple of times. Israel once used concrete. But it wouldn't happen now because hostages could be inside.

It‚Äôs amazing to lean every day again, that we life in the future..
This lady think Israel going to free Palestine from Hamas? She may not realize no matter how bad Hamas is, people of Palestine won‚Äôt tolerate be controlled by another country, with a different religion. This is like the same thinking of the USA public when they go ‚Äòfree Afghan‚Äô or ‚Äòfree Iraq‚Äô
No, the moment of clarity is when they prefer continue playing who lived here longer than agreeing to a two state solution and squash the beef for their kid's sake.But this right here is also a perfect demonstration of why the movement is full of shit. I backed all that Free-Palestine shit back in uni for multiple years. I did community work, and I'm fkn asian, this ME shit has nothing to do with any of my background. Didn't see you bandwagoners back then, the second I raise actual valid points criticizing legitimate flaws in their movement after years of being involved, oh now you happy to jump down my throat like I'm happy to see people die.Fucking hypocrites the lot of you. Nah, the Israelis and Palestinians will keep killing each other long after you and I are dead, I realised the futility of this movement and noped the fuck out of it for my sanity. I suggest you do the same.
That‚Äôs a wild turn of events. Cause don‚Äôt they think all the Jews over there aren‚Äôt real Jews anyway? Lol
Using this!
How many German civilians dies in WW2 because their government started a war they couldn't finish?  Explain to me how this is different.  We carpet bombed Germany and Japan into the dark ages ... that led to fundamental change.
Short version: both During the Ottoman Empire both Jews and Arabs lived together. It was the Zionism that made the ‚ÄúJewish state‚Äù  that forced Arabs out and recruited Jews in, as supported by the British and US in 1948.  The phrase ‚Äúa land without people for a people.‚ÄùThe UN was eventually given the reign of the area when the British couldn‚Äôt make it work. The UN made the two-state solution and said they (UN) would control Jerusalem. Israel continues to break that agreement by encouraging settlers to take over Palestinian homes. Source that is decent:https://www.vox.com/world-politics/2023/10/24/23930269/israel-hamas-gaza-palestine-occupation-zionism-displacementVideo that should always be considered as it‚Äôs breaking international law as agreed upon by UN.

Yeah, it's really too bad. I was curious what they had said. It's pretty interesting tracking propaganda
We live in very confusing time...
The Black Hebrew Israelites from the United States are a different group from the Black Ethiopian Jews.The first group are not recognized as Jewish, but sone of them were allowed to stay.The latter group has centuries if not longer of religious tradition, but are definitely discriminated against. At one point over 98% of IUDs prescribed in Israel were found to be prescribed to Ethiopia Jew women. They also had to abandon some of their practices to be in line with Ashkenazim practices. The last Ethiopians Jewish monks were allowed to practice, but no more are allowed.

It's a sign of a reclining military power.
Interesting that they don't have a democratic process since Hamas took control of Gaza, little did the people of Gaza know that once hamas were in control they would never relinquish that control
Racists are not that smart
Israel's entire ideological agenda for decades has been to maintain a Jewish majority. Annexing Gaza would add 2 million Arab citizens, and annexing the West Bank would add a few million more Arabs. That would result in an Arab majority, which Israel doesn't want.
A professor at alma mater potentially just faked an anti-palestinian hate crime against themselves for attention. Things are getting weird at universities right now.

Ive seen some videos published of eliminated Hamas infantry already, i just think the IDF don't tend to post these kind of footage.
Yeah the people who support Nazis, proud boys, neo-fascism, or Hamas will have trouble finding job opportunities in the future. Actions have consequences.
True. I'm deeply disappointed on the recent transformation of this sub. Dehumanising the conflict and making it a football match.
Steven Seagal ought to be able to provide some suggestions
See how no one wants to be associated with *that*.
This goes way back to the Old testament and I believe it was Solomon's wife, Queen of Sheba. She was possibly Ethiopian and her son returned to Ethiopia with the Ark of the Covenant. A sect of Ethiopian Jews live there to guard it.
We have also been there done that. No way we take back control over the strip.
why american women tend to look so psychotic or high on drugs ?
Don't need 2mil partially hostile Palestinians under their rule. Israel will probably end up taking control of the strip for a short while, DMZ a large part of it along the border and try and hand it to PA representatives. US will help too.
They likely don't want 2 million extra Palestinian Muslim citizens, especially when those in Gaza are the most radicalized. If they succeed in destroying Hamas and occupying Gaza my suggestion would be to install a government of Palestinian moderates they trust, possibly Fatah, to run the place. Then maintain the occupation until the new government have things under control, especially security. Withdraw the occupation slowly when you're confident the new government are secure and Hamas won't just return.
Student sounds very happy about people dying‚Ä¶.
I think the trail of tears in our treatment of Native Americans is still debated if it could be considered a genocide. Although there‚Äôs no denying that like the trail of tears among other things was super fucked up. In my history classes in the south they did not sugar coat it.
May you rot in hell
Agreed! No one expected the Spanish Inquisition
A people deserving to be murdered by the thousands? What was the moment of clarity for you, that you needed to be on the side of genocide?
It's basically what happens when the 2.0 GPA activities student starts taking a interest in history. They spent all that time ignoring a free education and instead opted to make shit up that sounded good to them.
Doesn‚Äôt even realize that Hamas was created by Israel
Do the black Israelites ever mess with the Nation of Islam. I know the Nation has a whole militant wing that they contract out for security services. I need to see this now. Black Israelites trying to take on the Nation.
shes Pro-Israeli so nothings going to happen to her, because God forbid you call out an ally of the West for genocide
how do you know she's a princeton staff member?
ye my bedouins are always there as the best gashashim... but seriously no idea why they even still have this divison, they mostly die stepping on land mines.
If it was up to me I would relocate them all on the Jordanian border and expand Palestinian territory in the West Bank. This way Israel Borders a friendlier Country to the south and Palestine has friendlier neighbors as well.
[Yeah I believe one of them is in this video from the 1950s where students from different African countries got to talk about their experiences with racism.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=840XWjnt9wc&amp;ab_channel=MentalHealthTreatment) He's Ethiopian but he doesn't believe he's black, which of course is interesting just because blackness is a white person construct and people within Africa are very genetically diverse so technically the only thing that binds many is their skin colour is a shade of brown, but it's pretty funny to see an Ethopian who I assume is Jewish seem to believe that this means he's superior to the black Africans he's with. The Nigerian is very amused by it. The whole thing should be watched just for the Nigerian who schools everyone.
Nothing new on planet earth.Anyway‚Ä¶
I was wondering why they'd be mad at the Palestinian supporters but that makes sense. I didn't realize they believed they should be the Zionists living there. The fact that there's white Zionism and black Zionism is insane.
Israel does not want it. They have tried to pay Egypt to take it from them. They will not annex or control Gaza after this is over, but who knows what it will look like. I am thinking they will form a larger buffer zone between the two. Politically, no prediction can be made I think.
Oh boy, you're about to learn about some stuff you wish you never knew existed. This is one of those groups that is not only just disgusting in ideology, but also so insanely dumb that every side of the spectrum going to both extremes wants nothing to do with them. They are BIG DUMB and don't even have a sliver of ideology to hide behind. Lots of mentally ill folk. It's very sad, but also real enough to be aware of if you're anywhere near where they operate.
Every major sub? Go look at worldnews, news, and the Europe subreddit then come back here and say what propaganda they are filled with

how about 'Hamas shouldn't shoot quassams, you know, it all'?
At this point, why doesn't Israel just annex the place?
Dudes didnt flinch
Nice, no one can associate this one with my kind for once lmao
OP trolling Israeli supporters.
And they face discrimination.
Yes of course! I have nothing against religion. Everyone is welcome to make religion for you at home as he wants... for all I care. That is up to everyone. You can use that for yourself or not. Everyone is welcome to go to church or to the mosque... there I do not judge anyone... but that is up to everyone and is a private matter. In politics it has nothing to look for and especially nothing in such conflicts. Point!
Sounds like they aren't insane in a good way m8
Just flood the tunnels with shit
They aren't even harmless crazies either,  a couple of them planned a terror attack on jews a few years ago in jersey.  https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019_Jersey_City_shooting
&gt; Or they are doing what terrorist are best as. 90% of them throw away their guns and put on civ clothing. Then wait until they can return and build up again.&gt; &gt; My guess is that they will never have a chance to come back. And that they will go be terrorist in some ~~middle eastern or African~~ **European** country instead.Ftfy. Sweden, England, France and Germany is my best bet.

Yes, as i said. The USA is very keen that this wasnt a genocide, [just some hardship.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2021/04/29/us-biden-armenian-genocide-native-americans-recognition/)
‚ÄúWhen Israel leaves.‚ÄùI don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre going to, this time.  This whole thing was the result of giving Gaza an inch over and over again.  Now we‚Äôve seen their yard. Gazan self governance is over.  When the war ends they‚Äôll probably give it over to the far more moderate, far more friendly Palestinian Authority currently governing the West Bank.   - and I do hope that they are successful rebuilding and governing a refreshed new Gaza, supplying its inhabitants with the resources and opportunities that Hamas has so long denied them.  But it‚Äôs going to be one hell of a long road, and the Hamas sympathies in Gaza, like the Imperialism in Japan and Nazi conditioning in Germany, will likely take two or three generations to actually dissipate.
Yes Hamas should stand in a single file in the open spaces.
Cool. Thanks for the insight
Heh, I'm picturing Bedouin's feel into the stereotype the way Native Americans fell into it on this side of the Atlantic. But then again, I've read accounts of how insanely well those people navigate the barren deserts out there.
Wearing civilian clothing as a combatant means many of the rules "regulating" warfare under the Geneva Convention no longer apply to you.  Cluster munitions, thermobaric warheads and flamethrowers incoming for urban warfare.
My dude this is 70 square miles, there is nowhere that‚Äôs too deeply committed to withdraw from or reinforce. Everything is within 5 miles from the border
It seems like if Hamas doesn‚Äôt give up or fight openly Israel should stay permanently. Israel needs to be sure they wont be attacked again and if the Palestinians don‚Äôt help root out the terrorists that‚Äôs impossible and they shouldn‚Äôt expect the territory back.
Palestinians always had a way to build a future. They just never chose to go that way.

There is a scope called "Smart Shooter".  You pull the trigger and aim at the general direction of the drone. The scope tells you where to aim and when it thinks the odds to hit are high it will shot on it own (The trigger is already squeezed).  PS, I don't have any state secrets that's from Wikipedia in Hebrew)
No babies were beheaded...
actually they tried to shoot him, you can see how he even tried to load the gun again but the gun seemed to have a problem, many others pointed that one out so i had to watch the video again and the driver got extremely lucky, and people in such absolute panic mode wouldn't think rationally like they clearly did not, since they looked very obvious on times they expected the gun to go boom, sorry my english but up there on comments you can see many people saying it as in the gun had some problem in it.
Electronic warfare works very well against drones actually......especially in small space where you know where the enemy is and could be. In Ukraine drones can ''run free'' way more simply because its a massive battlefield with thousands of kilometers (and even there, the main reason why drones die are Electronic warfare systems, both Ukrainians and Russians admitted that)
As it should be.

Oh, also just realised you had the gall to say Gaza's economic problems are on Hamas, as they've been SELF MANAGED FOR 18 years. LMAO. Like wow. That is really, really cooked. Israel controls their economy."Despite the economic recovery, the management of fiscal policies remained challenging as the size of the deficit before aid reached US$1.26 billion while aid hit a record low of only US$317 million in 2021. Consequently, the PA had to rely on domestic resources to finance its needs and has also been paying partial salaries since November 2021.Economic growth and the PA‚Äôs revenues remain below potential due to movement and access restrictions, including in Area C. Palestinian external trade is controlled by Israel and is subject to costly non-tariff barriers that have reduced competitiveness. Furthermore, the Israeli closures on Gaza has resulted in an almost completely closed economy. The fiscal deficit (before aid) is expected to remain large in 2022 at 5.1% of GDP. "[From the world bank](https://www.worldbank.org/en/news/press-release/2022/05/09/the-palestinian-economy-will-continue-to-operate-below-potential-without-concrete-policy-actions)"Tarik Alami, Director of the Emerging and Conflict‚ÄëRelated Issues Division of the Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA), introduced the Secretary‚ÄëGeneral‚Äôs note on the ‚ÄúEconomic and social repercussions of the Israeli occupation on the living conditions of the Palestinian people in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, including East Jerusalem, and the Arab population in the occupied Syrian Golan‚Äù (document A/77/90‚ÄìE/2022/66).  He noted that Israel has escalated its use of force against the Palestinians, including illegal unwarranted force, amounting to arbitrary deprivation of life.He further shared that Israel has denied Palestinians access to their natural resources, including shared water resources and an estimated 1.5 billion barrels of oil reserves in the West Bank as well as more than $2.5 billion worth of natural gas off the Gaza coast.  ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äôs system of policies and practices has systematically stripped the Palestinian economy of vital elements for its healthy operation, whose productive base continues to shrink, thereby exacerbating dire living conditions,‚Äù he emphasized.  The Syrian Golan has also suffered from discriminatory policies regarding land, water and zoning, he added.The observer for the State of Palestine, noting that over 2 million Palestinians living in Gaza continue to suffer from the illegal blockade, deepening poverty and unemployment, stressed that Israel continues to allow ‚Äúterrorist settlers‚Äù to kill her people in plain sight, destroying their homes and attacking their agricultural land, fruit and olive trees.  Ending the illegal occupation is key to ending the suffering of the Palestinians so they can achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, she stated, further urging the international community to fulfil its legal obligations to end the apartheid regime."

But wouldn‚Äôt it be more feasible to have black people in Israel due to geography than a Chinese in Norway?
That is true tho, that seat belongs to the USSR, not Russia so they in fact never had right to veto. Russia is technically not even a member of the UN.
Humanity is so stupid.
‚ÄòUN Secretary-General Ant√≥nio Guterres rightly said that the most recent violence ‚Äúgrows out of a long-standing conflict, with a 56-year-long occupation and no political end in sight.‚Äù Various UN officials and investigative mechanisms have reaffirmed for years that Israel‚Äôs occupation of Palestinian territory ‚Äì the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and Gaza ‚Äì has been ongoing since 1967 and has no legal validity. Throughout Israel and the occupied territory, the Israeli government has imposed a two-tiered legal and political system of systematic discrimination and oppression to maintain the domination by Jewish Israelis over Palestinians. Experts and human rights groups have recognized that this system satisfies the prevailing evidentiary standard for apartheid, a crime against humanity.‚Äô‚ÄòIsraeli authorities and security forces consistently employ violence and inhumane acts targeting Palestinians, including arbitrary and extrajudicial killings, torture, the denial of fundamental rights and collective punishment. In Gaza, Israel has imposed a total blockade by air, land and sea since 2007, inflicting an ongoing humanitarian crisis on 2.3 million Palestinians living in what many have characterized as the world‚Äôs largest ‚Äúopen-air prison.‚Äù In the Occupied West Bank, illegal settlement expansion has escalated. According to the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), 789 Palestinian-owned structures have already been demolished or seized by Israeli government authorities so far in 2023. In recent years, plans for thousands of housing units have been advanced to expedite settlement expansion, effectively guaranteeing that the occupied territory will remain under Israeli control in perpetuity. Under the Geneva Conventions, settlement expansion is a war crime.‚ÄôBut yea you‚Äôre totally right, Hamas is the only one to blame/sAnd you do realize Israel took part in starting Hamas, right? Interesting how that is. I wonder why they would do such a thing????Miss me with your bullshit
No way to compare this with what is happening in Ukraine. You cant do this when fighting a peer opponent instead of insurgency. Infantry support in the open is yesteryear with the modern battlefield under constant observation from drones.Anytime there is a concentration of troops they get detected and targeted with artillery in Ukraine, no such thing in Gaza strip.
&gt;Hamas' propagandaWho has more audience and credibility? Think again, robot.
Sure. That, drones, small teams in IDF uniforms infiltrating rear areas, detonating huge tunnel bombs, etc etc.It will be ugly.
I wish them all the best . Good luck to them. The obscenity of 7th October, like a thousand Bataclans, needs to be avenged.
Tabbing into and occupying Gaza is not a ex I'd want to be in on,  honestly wish them the best whole thing is giving me anxiety.
Jumpmasters are just paratroopers that are certified to manage the jumping operations of other paratroopers. It has nothing to do with the pathfinder skillset.
Hamas have endless rockets but are they actually well equipped on the ground or do they just have AKs and Paragliders
Just me or is there very little enthusiasm or pressure on these guys. It quite literally looks like training.
I was there yesterday in Princeton all day when this was going on. I was actually right around the corner from this event too. Had no idea it was going on. It was a trip to open Reddit and then see this.
You people do realize you can dislike a group but logically understand the tactic. What everyone is on about Hamas in Tunnels. Do you think Ukraine would be fighting the way it is if it didn‚Äôt have the full support of the world, anti aircraft weapons, and at time air superiority. How else do you expect them to fight an overwhelming power?The same crap was said to the Americans while fighting the British about using Guerilla warfare and not stand in rows ‚Äúlike you‚Äôre supposed to‚Äù.Fighting the IDF conventionally would be like fighting the mongols on an open field with no cavalry.
Or just indirect fire in general
Ukraine killed 10,000 of their own ethnic russian civilians in bombing Donbass they aren't a great example of anything
They can also serve as tactical toilets
You‚Äôll honestly believe anything when you just want to hate the man. As a trans I used to hate him because I wanted to believe he was misogynist. I believed the media lie and now I regret it. Prices are 2x as much last year and now we‚Äôre fighting a double proxy war between Russia and Iran. I used to truly believe that trump was going to cause WW3 because that‚Äôs what the news said. He made peace with North Korea, and peace in the Middle East. I just wish I could go back in time and tell myself to not listen to the lies. I‚Äôm sorry I voted for this president, Biden turned into what people said Trump was going to be.

Completely ignoring that the charter of Hamas calls for genocide of Jews and ppl voting for that.Completely ignoring history and that Palestinians and Arabs have decline any 2 state solution

I imagine Hamas wants to lure the IDF in then employ tactics like sniper fire, ambushes and IEDs.
Israel use to border Judah and Philistine Kingdom of states.Due to repeated religious tension, borders and countries changed over the years.  Some groups were oppressed.  Jews were even treated like second class citizens for a long time.Iranian Muslims then invaded the holy land.  Surprisingly, they allowed the Jewish people and other religions to access their religious/ holy grounds.Only if they paid a heavy tax...of course.
Was posted to Sufa Outpost on the border a few months ago (Lads from the 7th Brigade rotated with my unit) with the bedouins, they're are insane, but in a good way.They know the gaza strip like the back of their hand, the area they held with us was the quietest part of the entire border because they took 0 shit.Their RoE started with shooting at anyone getting close to the border, which was not the official RoE.They are one of the only units which the Palestinians are genuinely afraid of, simply because of their brutality towards them.And they're pretty funny guys, overall lovely fellas and i have no doubts they'll fold the gaza strip in half if given the chance.P.S. I've said a couple of times that Sufa wouldn't have been lost if they were there, they've got balls of steel and no mercy.

Think of the Israel / Palestinian conflict as a good old fashioned 90s WWF - Royal Rumble. New bodies enter the ring every minute, friends become enemies, histories are sometimes remembered and forgotten - depending on how it benefits each party in the moment‚Ä¶ in the end your realize there really wasn‚Äôt a plot and 30 people fought for a meaningless belt and the only winner was Mr McMahon as he took all the money off of war profiteering.

The title make it seem like it's a pro Palestinian who is the perpetrator, but it's a pro-Israel woman who steals it from a Jewish student
\&gt;This is a common accusation by Hamas-apologists that does not hold water.It's not like there are an entire subsection of historians on this subject who widely agree on using the term ethnic cleansing. Those historians being holocaust survivors, or former zionists as well as direct descendants of key figures in Zionist movements...you're calling Chomsky a Hamas apologist. Basically writing off the entire New History community as "Hamas apologists". What a truly bizarre statement.\&gt;he only ethnic cleansing the Israeli government committed in recent times\&gt;recent times....right...I guess there is some kind of timer on how long it takes until decades of ethnic cleansings are no longer relevant to a people. Hmm interesting. I'll uhh meditate on that one. It's not like 2023 had the most Palestinian casualties from Israel aggression since 2005 or earlier IIRC.\&gt;Building materials are being diverted to be used for Hamas tunnels. That's why Israel is limiting the influx of materials. There are several cement factories in Gaza however.That doesn't change how your average Palestinian lives on a day to day basis. [They literally have to work in half destroyed factories](https://youtu.be/hw4CH-Jg6lY?t=193) to keep themselves going. That is, if they are amongst the minority of people lucky enough to have a job.\&gt;Hamas themselves outlawed the digging of new wells and dug up water pipes to create rockets.That is such a disingenuous representation of historical fact you cannot actually be serious."The legacy of Israel‚Äôs 50-year occupation of the Palestinian territories has been systematic human rights violations on a mass scale. One of its most devastating consequences is the impact of Israel‚Äôs discriminatory policies on Palestinians‚Äô access to adequate supplies of clean and safe water.Soon after Israel occupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, and the Gaza Strip, in June 1967, the Israeli military authorities consolidated complete power over all water resources and water-related infrastructure in the Occupied Palestinian Territories (OPT). 50 years on, Israel continues to control and restrict Palestinian access to water in the OPT to a level which neither meets their needs nor constitutes a fair distribution of shared water resources.In November 1967 the Israeli authorities issued Military Order 158, which stated that Palestinians could not construct any new water installation without first obtaining a permit from the Israeli army. Since then, the extraction of water from any new source or the development of any new water infrastructure would require permits from Israel, which are near impossible to obtain. Palestinians living under Israel‚Äôs military occupation continue to suffer the devastating consequences of this order until today. They are unable to drill new water wells, install pumps or deepen existing wells, in addition to being denied access to the Jordan River and fresh water springs. Israel even controls the collection of rain water throughout most of the West Bank, and rainwater harvesting cisterns owned by Palestinian communities are often destroyed by the Israeli army. As a result, some 180 Palestinian communities in rural areas in the occupied West Bank have no access to running water, according to OCHA. Even in towns and villages which are connected to the water network, the taps often run dry."\- from [Amnesty International](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2017/11/the-occupation-of-water/)Why don't you explain WHY Hamas banned the free drilling of wells? Because their underground aquifier was being contaminated. They didn't ban it btw, they started licensing it, because people could freely dig wells without regulation and it was making the groundwater undrinkable, as well as they were facing a groundwater deficit. They have a very limited supply of water, thanks to Israeli oppression, so it needs to be regulated.There are definitely legitimate concerns about how that money will be used be a clearly corrupt group like Hamas. But the bottom line is this problem exists because of decades of water insecurity as imposed by Israel.There is good reason why there are literally people who study the Holocaust for a career [calling out Israel's actions as genocidal.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWGGjLZNuyg&amp;t=332s&amp;ab_channel=DemocracyNow%21)
Sometimes they use human shields. Sometimes isreal just kills civilians and calls them human sheilds
In that third video you can clearly see a rocket that ignites (either from the IDF strike, or in the launch process and then hit by the IDF).
Imagine you were raised to believe jews run the world and everything bad is communism designed to keep you down and other crazy nazi shit but everyone has tailored the conspiracy theories to be just for your experience as a black American instead of white... and then they told you that you're really the chosen people and modern Jewish people were just faking.Now you're an anti semite and believe both the Israelis and Palestinians Occupy your historical land.White supremacists rejoice knowing black people want to leave to go fight the other people that white supremacists hate, and evangelicals throw their hands up proudly proclaiming "the rapture is upon us!"Its like a cult cooked up in a lab somewhere to break class consciousness with religious and racial division. Which is usually followed by fascists trying to step in with ORDER to unify a white majority.
I guess. It‚Äôs just the Ven diagram of people colliding that makes it that much more real.
Were the experiments just to make white people? Or for some other trait that happened to also cause pale skin?

Thank you, Captain Obvious!
Wow, parroting Hamas' propaganda, that Israeli soldiers killed most Israeli civilians, even though we have clear videos that they published themselves on their Telegram (and later removed, of course) where we can see them executing and otherwise harming civilian families or party goers.
Seems like healthy discourse.
It's the same with Vietnam and likely most wars peer wars. Everyone's perception from many of the special forces after-ward is a bit tainted, they were incredibly hard people but it was mostly the willingness to die over a mission.
Correct. Most of the armor are at open areas. The real battle should begin in the city proper
Mario Bros?
Lol black Israelites are the most confused group of people to come out of this social media era. They don‚Äôt need facts to believe at all
There are black jews from Ethiopia... not  ethnically  jewish obviously, but converted around the 4th century CE. A bunch of them migrated to Israel in the 20th century so now they're the \*actual black hebrew israelites :)The white jews don't like them much. They're pretty awfully discriminated against.
I think we can all come together and hate the black Israelites as one..
Well yeah ‚Äòrans off‚Äô literally isn‚Äôt a real thing because OP is a dumbass
&gt; You can keep your head in the sand. I've been to plenty of pro-Palestine marches in my youth when I bought into their propaganda.&gt; I now see them for what they are.In my professional opinion it seems like you‚Äôre wasting too much effort on this conflict regardless of which side you‚Äôre on

These people dont know each other and likely have nothing to with whays going on over there yet already hate each other. Terrible
Just because you're  part of an oppressed minority doesn't mean you're not a terrible person. There's racist, black fascists just like there's Israeli Nazis.It's a sad fact of the world.
Don‚Äôt tell them about how conservative and orthodox Jews in Israel see black people.
Facts are IDF didn‚Äôt care about saving the civilians that day and fired shells and killed a whole bunch of kids, all the burnt bodies and babies were more than likely a result of tank shelling into the Kibbutz as stated by Israeli media themselves
Loking for hostages
Pathfinders have Titanium balls. They didn't even flinch on the explosion near them lol they were only like "Meh".
Yeah, the problem of course is to discover them. Also, there's a possibility of some tunnels collapsing even from not direct bombing. They [reinforce them with concrete](https://i.imgur.com/zf6Wwgg.png), but i doubt the structure is stable.
Can confirm, dudes are some of the best at what they do (also of all the Druze I met, were always super friendly and had a ‚Äúyou have my back, I have yours‚Äù mentality. Haven‚Äôt checked their balls, but yes, likely steel or titanium.

No he is correct. You need to read your bible. And not just the Bible but lots and lots of historical texts will say otherwise so how is he wrong exactly? Explain yourself.

This is the weirdest race war I've ever seen.
Oh, it gets weirder. Iirc they believe that white people were invented by a scientist doing selective breeding experiments on an island 6,000 years ago.
Growing up in the 90's, I totally find these events absolutely normal.

No

Chris Hanson brought them. ‚ÄòWhy don‚Äôt you take a seat?‚Äô
Another person who believes the "facts" of a terror organization that livesreamed a massacre of civilians and then refused to acknowledge it happened. Just like the so called bombing that was their own fault (and somehow they knew how many people got killed an hour after the attack). Furthermore this is a war of survival for Israel, civilians were told to evacuate because their presence won't stop the IDF anymore.When your main base of operations for committing a genocide on civilians is in a hospital people will get hurt, that's why you shouldn't put your base in a hospital.
If it‚Äôs anything like 2014, the soldiers will face more IEDs and booby-trapped civilian houses than Hamas fighters.
During battle breaks, I would happily use a camo Lazy Boy.
Probably to document what was happening....
Fuck your phone.
They are clearly not under much small arms fire to be on offence like that.
It‚Äôs deploying a smokescreen
Happy Hunting, boys!!
Even if it's 90m it still needs a path to ground level, and with more and more entrances collapsing it would probably becomes really claustrophobic.
For sure, they won‚Äôt be doing a ‚ÄòForest Gump‚Äô on the tunnels.
Err don‚Äôt Hamas have to stop firing? And if they are calling for that why don‚Äôt they have both sets of flags?
I completely agree. üíØ
There supposed to be no personal phones on soldiers inside Gaza. Only helmetcams in some units.
It's weird that some black Americans just randomly decide they're the original Jews lolKind of feels like a Chinese person randomly deciding they're the true ancestors of the vikings
Trust me this wasn‚Äôt nearly as bad as the Spanish Inquisition
Give them hellEdit: to be clear, to Hamas.
Yeah if you read the books, essentially Arrakis was settled by middle eastern folks. The Harkonens are Russian. The Atreides family is Spanish
Don't know about leveling Gaza entirely. It has to be combed, but i have no idea how you can move population of 2 mil into open space. IDF ordered evacuation from Northern Gaza to south of Wadi Gaza. Maybe the plan is to clear the north, and then evacuate from south through checkpoints back north. And repeat the process in the south. I just can't imagine how dangerous it will be on checkpoints and if it's possible at all. Sounds too ambitious.
I have a strong feeling idf aren‚Äôt going to leave this time.
SUNDAY SUNDAY SUNDAY üí•
Man looked at that explosion like ‚Äúdamn that was a little close‚Äù
A large amount blended in with the civilians and fled south waiting to return when Israel leaves‚Ä¶
From what we have seen with the tunnels, how feasible is it for a bomb disposal drone with a LMG on it to be used and recon and clear out those tunnels
Just a lowkey simchat torah /s
Like the Colosseum, bring back blood sport and make it entertaining!
Man I miss Nassau, such a nice walk this time of year
This is incredible
Hmm then these people can go to Gaza and rally all they want. Were they out there when Hamas was beheading and killing babies, elderly and innocents?  Hamas brought this on the Palestinian people. Go be angry at them.
As a centrist I'm just enjoying the show
are these tanks knocked out or?
No, she will get promoted. Folks chanting "Free Palestine" are at a greater risk  of having their academics and future jeopardized. This conflict and injustice transcend borders.Edit: I witness this drama on my LinkedIn. The pro-zionist propaganda gets reposted, promoted and likes, loves, and celebrates from senior leadership in Fortune 100 companies. Lunatics posting it actually get noticed in a positive way and turn it into a professional self-promotion tool. On the other hand, the rare voices that point out neutral politically correct sources such as HRW and DWB pointing to the unprecedented humanitarian crisis unfolding in Gaza get no support from their leadership, mostly a few brave acquaintances. These same posters later in the week post resources about getting employment and anti-harassment lawyers and other resources.
I think they are going to level gaza. And thus, just plug all the tunnels. Then after at least week or maybe months go down and see what has happened. Clearing tunnels is dangerous and you don't do that if you don't have to. Israel can just wait and see what happens.
Special Reconnaissance. They are more like Air Force Forward Observers now though because of weather satellites

Why is the caption so confusing
Yes but the battalion sends out teams of trackers to all of the front line, from Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and even to the west banks. When I served in the infantry, every morning patrol started with one tracker accompanying my force and checking out for any signs of infiltrations.They are great guys, extremely proficient even though some of them have a hard time waking up in the morningsüòÇ
Actually Karen is a pro-Israeli supporter. I wonder if those kids were jewish
HAMAS!
If previous operations is any indication - it's the mix of what you said. They are wearing civilians clothes, and then ambush. Basically your usual guerilla tactics, only with massive advantage of sophisticated tunnel system, allowing them to flank anywhere in Gaza. I'm sure the labyrinth of Gaza metro is already damaged, but seeing how deep big parts of it was built (up to 90m), it's still a huge hazard.
And she pulled her hair while trying to yank the phone from her‚Ä¶ what a cunt
They do it to *every single video* shot from military hardware‚Ä¶
They seem to be very good at not letting them leak footage. I guess they learned from Russia's mistakes. I haven't seen a single unsanctioned clip outside of a base.
There are people who suspect that Wael Al-Dahdouh was a target of the shelling, but due to him not being in the area, he survived while his family perished.
Geez, you had a decent job why let personal feelings cloud that?!
Indeed I know nothing about war, but I can recognize a genocide, and you have one happening RIGHT NOW.
Helium?
 BI are committedly and confidently batfuck crazy.  Over the years I've probably listened to two or three hours of BI ranting outside of metro stations in DC and I still have no idea what their position is on any subject or issue.  They're so crazy and their rants are so meandering and incoherent that the first time I saw them I literally thought they were a homeless improv comedy group making fun of street preachers.
Everyone is crazy!
Yes
holy shit you destroyed him
Or they are doing what terrorist are best as. 90% of them throw away their guns and put on civ clothing. Then wait until they can return and build up again. My guess is that they will never have a chance to come back. And that they will go be terrorist in some middle eastern or African country instead.
This is exactly how both other attempts to seize Gaza went in the past. So both sides know what they're doing.The IDF is playing cautious and slow. Picking their way through the area as best they can. While Hamas is hassling them to try and slow them down.But once Israel gets fully inside Gaza proper that's when Hamas will come out in force. Waiting until the IDF gets well in their territory and then popping out of the ground all around them and behind them.At the same time they have tunnels and bunkers spread throughout israel. So they may not even be in or around gaza. Which is why Israel has spread themselves well throughout the country. Because they can come out at any point anywhere.
Hamas won't fight until the IDF is so deeply committed that they can't withdraw without a loss of face. At that point we'll see whatever they have in their bag of tricks. Hopefully the IDF is prepared.
Sitzkrieg
What a great counter argument. Definitely proves them wrong!Not.
Young Karen
They did not.
...when you cross the line of morality and become a evil organization that has no value for human life, not even their own. Their religion command them to be counter to the civilized world. Savages lie and manipulate information to conform to their narrative, much like the left does here in the US.  I do not believe in their religion or plight. Gaza has elected Hamas as their regime, the consequences for that will be clear soon. They perpetrated crimes against humanity!
They are cowards and always hide behind civilians in order to fool people like yourself.
I think the point was they‚Äôre not native to Israel
Let them fight
The world is going to shit
Yeah, almost like they were invaded by a hoard of marauders who went door to door and executed families in their homes, as well as hundreds of people at a music festival. You know, pretty mild stuff to take in.
The vast majority of targets hit aren‚Äôt rocket launch sites.
yep, but plenty of rural and nonamerican redditors so i figured it‚Äôd be helpful context
According to NYT, Israel agreed to US request reducing the massive invasion to more surgical one.
That would make sense if they didn't pick and choose which videos to blur out and which ones not to. "We don't need to let them know all of our capabilities all the time. Just all of our capabilities some of the time."OPSEC!Somehow I don't think the IDF is that stupid but you do you.
Doesn't Chiraq have enough problems without importing new ones
Maybe they are all just angry people and need toLet it out
They're in pretty much of every metropolitan city in the US.
I want to draw a simple picture, why can't idf, which is one of the most trained, most "powerful" army in the world and currently supported by American special services, why this army does not just use the same way they used to capture ussama ben la den, sending a swat like team to go and capture them smoothly. I am sure hamas used a door to access the rooms. With their level of tech, do not tell me they can't identify these rooms. And If it was really the "goal" which again is sooo WILD as a strategy, why use phosphorus bombs that are clearly deadly more to humans than buildings. And let's not derive from the real issue, we are in the 21st century and a genocide is happening. A genocide. Let's not always use hamas as scapegoat to justify the current atrocities happening.
There was at least one attempt to ambush from tunnel in Northern Gaza. Reportedly "tens militants killed". My guess is they are waiting for IDF to advance into urban areas proper. Attacking in the open is very high risk of being picked up by air support.
Most of Hamas are inside tunnels/buildings in the cities. Israeli infantry and armor has only been spotted near the outskirts of towns
Support is fine but Why the fuck are these people here if they want to fight someone else's war? Go over there are fight it.Come here to escape all that bullshit
I wonder how much will they commit to the invasion? Seems to have been a significant reduction in the scope of the incursion. What is Israel‚Äôs plan for after? They level the North of Gaza and then what? Hamas will just return in some other form if the Palestinians have no way to build a future.
‚ÄúSignatures?‚Äù I assure you, the reason they do it is to not reveal their capabilities which, once known, can then be exploited.
Hey man this is the guy I listen too, he looks at both sides of the story without bullshit politics in between hope this helps: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro-ERnn7-uo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ro-ERnn7-uo), this guy isn't on either side has no biases.  You can watch his other videos on Ukraine for example where you makes fun of both sides of the conflict and points out their failures if you don't believe me.
Your gods are not real. Grow up. Your religions are grifts. Wake up.
Right wingers mad confused who to side with haha
There's no way in hell they can (or even want to) ID so many casualties so quickly. They probably took the full lists of people who lived in buildings that were destroyed, without checking if they evacuated or not.
They claim black people are the actual Jews.Funny there is a strain of white supremacy that claims some white people are the lost tribe of Jews, and all the other Jews are just faking it.Both groups call actual Jews everything from lizard people to subhumans.
Hoping IDF discovers the camouflaged tunnel entrances soon!
Yes, exactly that, placing checkpoints. There are also reports of hamas shooting at fleeing civilians who refuse to go back north.

Black Hebrew Israelites are Black Americans who believe that Black people are the ‚Äúreal‚Äù Jews, and that other Jews are not real Jews.You‚Äôve probably seen some of them on the streets demanding apologies and kisses to their actual boots from guilt-tripped White people in on-line videos shared by conservatives.Also, there are some Black Americans who are Black Hebrew Israelites who immigrated to Israel and fought to be able to stay. It‚Äôs been a generation or so since, and some of them even serve in the IDF.
Not sure what the MOS was, but I have a cousin who did his time in the Air Force as some sort of meteorology "pathfinder" type role. Their entire training was around parachuting into locations and setting up little weather and monitoring stations.Was a really cool peacetime job, but I was just thinking first time he told me about it "that sounds like suicide if an actual war breaks out".
I‚Äôm impressed those guys didn‚Äôt flinch when that explosion went off in the water. Eyes through the sights, down range at something
[There were casualties from mortar fire today](https://www.timesofisrael.com/liveblog_entry/idf-officer-seriously-hurt-soldier-moderately-injured-in-northern-gaza-strip/). So why wouldn't it be real footage?
Yea, dudes are just like ‚ÄúYou missed‚Äù and keep going about what they were doing. That‚Äôs some hardened shit right there

So if a killer calls before killing your entire family, he must probably be a good guy. I think you are experiencing 2nd hand Stockholm syndrome.
From the UN Definition of Genocide(a) Killing members of the group.(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group.(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part.(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births within the group.(e) Forcibly transferring children of one group to another group.All of the above contribute in killing of people being considered genocide. Israel is currently fulfilling at least points (a)-(d) easily. Get yourself some proper sources

Important to know Haaretz is a huge shitshow in such matters. Israelis have nothing but huge respect to such units. They are our brothers and we love them.

 They are asking for a fact,  not a story
This looks like someone created a "fantasy" what if and is passing it off as reality.Unlike the infamous Max Headroom signal hijacking on 22 NOV 1987, the linked video didn't cut in to anything. A dozen or more technological impossibilities, but the fact that the graphics and 2-box format are retained by the hijacker? Apparently interrupting each feed before the final Master Control Board AND broadcast signal?Unless the hijacker was LITERALLY operating the Master Control Board, this is just fantasy art. (The claim that it is found footage of a live event is a lie.)

CNN said that Hamas bases under the same hospital, next day it was striked and +500 were killed, that‚Äôs convenient. Hamas rockets can barely destroy a car, that‚Äôs damage to analyze
Language is very important in the context, and the Legacy media truly knows how to plant certain images inside people's heads shifting from one term to another just to try to circumvent the horror and justify it.
Are you kidding? The names of the victims are released. A video footage from Hamas terrorists GoPros massacring civilians were released. Interrogation footage from captured terrorists were released. Eyewitnesses accounts of the massacre were published. To say at this point that there is no evidence of Hamas killing children you are either blindly grasping for straws or intentionally lying. Either way it is a disgusting attempt to excuse a vicious  murderous terrorist organization that has no morals or  regards for human life of both Israeli and Palestinian people, and whom the world would be a better place without.

Didn't the Turkish McDonalds make a public statement supporting Palestine?
Genocide!=population growth
Bro you have serious brain rot. There is only one genocide happening in this moment and it ain‚Äôt the Jews.

Both Hamas and the state of Israel are equally terrorists who need to be stopped. Their supporters are both equally brainwashed and feast on the propaganda
Make Hamas hamwas
I found out the other day that the pathfinders in WW2 had something like an 80% fatality rate on any given mission.
I never called for a complete destruction of Israel though, they need to retreat south and call out Hamas for their actions.
https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/17drqcg/video_analysis_shows_gaza_hospital_hit_by_rocket/Meanwhile in reality we have trajectory, yield, damage to analyze.What sort of bomb meant to level a hospital barely makes a dent in the pavement and spreads fire like a molotov?What sort of bomb just vanishes in thin air after detonation?

A whole battalion for recon sounds like a lot. Aren't recon units usually much smaller? To which larger unit are they attached, brigade, division or higher?
Isnt basically every country but Germany denying its genocides?
Tactical cigarettes and mobile games should also be incorporated on top for most efficient combat engagement

The UK created the fake state called Israel in middle of Palestine. Will they ever live it down?
Yeah jesusss
Should see Israeli politicians on TV, they all seem unhinged or on something
god how can they keep laying about the same falsy story oh yeah they mean to do it , sometimes i wonder how can some people be just that evil
Negative. Crew chief is moonlighting as a dance instructor off post in his spare time. Gotta teach these moves to the kids early. That way when they enlist later they can expand and improve the routine.

Casually looks over‚Ä¶‚ÄôMmm, nice try I guess.‚Äô
"Bombed a hospital" are we talking about the hamas rocket that hit the hospital parking lot?
Just build an armored Rascal scooter
The israeli army are shooting randomly, bro they bombed a hospital, it‚Äôs not human shields, it‚Äôs ethnic hatred and cleansing
Dont lose hope - Ive heard from multiple people that a lot of forces are equipped with GoPros. We‚Äôve also already seen plenty of footage from SFs over the last few weeks. What they dont have, unlike UA, is an internet connection, neither in fighting or in rest areas. And everything needs to go through the IDF‚Äôs censors. So it would probably take a bit until the first of the footage, and will probably be dripped continuously for a long time.
They never denied Hamas killing children, quite the opposite more evidence of Hamas brutal terror attack emerged over the last couple of weeks. The only incorrect report was by one volunteer about 50 decapitated children, it turns out that 50 people (including children) were killed and burned, but only some were decapitated. I guess it makes it so much better...
&gt; That Israel is expanding their borders illegally?The last time the Israeli government expanded its borders was in 1967. Later, they withdrew from many territories they had occupied.&gt; That they're ethnic cleansing? This is a common accusation by Hamas-apologists that does not hold water. The only ethnic cleansing the Israeli government committed in recent times was when they removed Israeli settlers from the Gaza strip. There are aggressive Israeli settlers harassing Palestinians in the West Bank, but they are not acting at the behalf of the Israeli government. The relationship between them and Israeli society as a whole and the Israeli government are complex and highly controversial, with only the far-right of the political spectrum supporting them.&gt; That they've subjected Gaza to 60% unemploymentGaza had self-administration for 18 years. During this time, the Hamas elite amassed billions while average income there fell to a third of that of the West Bank. &gt; no way to leave the place without papersThis came in response to suicide bombings, attacks and shootings against Israeli soldiers and civilians.&gt; undrinkable waterHamas themselves outlawed the digging of new wells and dug up water pipes to create rockets.&gt; no way to rebuild their broken buildingsBuilding materials are being diverted to be used for Hamas tunnels. That's why Israel is limiting the influx of materials. There are several cement factories in Gaza however. &gt; businesses get only 14 hours of electricity a dayIsrael was finalizing a deal with Palestinians for a natural gas extraction platform at the coast of Gaza that would have given the strip energy independence and the ability to export gas to Egypt. The negotiations were still ongoing until Hamas attacked on October 7.
Friendly people, friendly religion, friendly finding out.
Then why the Israeli government denied that hamas killed kids. the hostages are being hospitalized, go watch the interview with the recently released ones
You may want to check the festival attack video again.If human shields make terrorist immune to attack, should we just hand over the world to the likes of them?
Stop smoking propaganda. A ton of children were murdered and a bunch kidnapped by Hamas during the Oct 7th attack.
Fuck Hamas
No kids were murdered, even netanyahu admitted that, israel is the one bombing kids and women left and right and justifying that by saying human shield, get your facts right
Great to see one muslim country giving support to another
Jewga jewga
No it‚Äôs not actually recon. The truth is that they are military trackers. They‚Äôre all Bedouins because the Bedouin way of life requires a good knowledge in tracking and ‚Äúdesert smarts‚Äù.-Spoken from my own experience working along side them.. Very nice people.. They make very strong field coffee üòÇüòÇüòÇ

My nephews fav article of clothing when he was 3 was a lime green tutu his best friend gave him to match her pink one she was wearing to a Sixers game.
What is there to be wrong about?That Israel is expanding their borders illegally? That they're ethnic cleansing? That they've subjected Gaza to 60% unemployment, no way to leave the place without papers, undrinkable water, no way to rebuild their broken buildings, businesses get only 14 hours of electricity a day? The amount of Palestinian refugee's outnumbers the population of what is left of Palestine by like factors of 3-5.Please tell me how I am wrong about any of that? I have not once ever supported violence against either side, yet somehow that's the conclusion half the people here love to jump to when you point out that Hamas was a predictable outcome of the mistreatment of Palestinians. It was predicted in 1895.There are multiple truths here. Hamas can have committed atrocities. Yes. But to ignore the fact that the atrocities committed against the people of palestine are far worse, far more calculating, far more extended and like 30x more severe...pretty absurd really. It's like you really dont want to understand the root cause of the problem. Just paint a side as evil and move on. Youre "wrong". Yep. righto. I'm wrong. I just made up the nakba. I just made up all of those stats. Yep. Ok. Alrighty then.
They are part of Israel‚Äôs relatively small professional army, and most of Israel‚Äôs professional army are specialists. If the choice is 22 year old full time soldiers or 18 year old conscripts that are 6 months out of high school, it‚Äôs an obvious choice.
Rans off. lol
Cause they are good soldiers
They are beduins. Shepherds. They have amazing knowledge of the terrain and the ability to recognise signs of movement. They know every inch of their sector and can tell if something happened
Ran off &gt; rans off.
yOU mUsT BE JoKIng..
They‚Äôre humans, just like you.  There is no difference between you and them.
Lots of well meaning but deluded people with a smattering of antisemites and a whole load of Islamists.
Why are they sending trackers in ground assault? Sounds like madness?
Would be stupid for IDF to allow GoPros on their soldiers. If soldiers are killed or taken prisoner, then it would be a fine propaganda tool for Hamas.  IDF seem to be fighting on twitter now so maybe they will though.
Used to be. Not any longer since they mostly ride across the Negev in cars now...
Makes it so any signatures of people walking around get lost in the pixels.They did they same thing with the helicopter videos of "Hamas fighters killed outside gaza". Blurry as hell. But even blurry you could tell none of them were wearing body armor or carrying guns.https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/QI9paSgJT2@1:47 you can see what body armor on Hamas guys actually looks like. Most the rest are just wearing clothes with no armor
hey they shoot back. oh well..
Everywhere they are, they only bring violence and hatred. Yet some woke morons support them in excuse of "peace".
Another pointless protest, full of people with double standards, that will change nothing.
You must be joking..
I've been in patrols on Egyptian border with trackers from 585. Bedouins. They are amazing at what they do. Their skills specifically useful at borders. Back in 2009, there was not much fence on big chunks of Egyptian-Israeli border and 10 meters wide combed sand line. They would pick up a trail from the line and continue tracking into Israeli territory. It was a period of lots of Sudanese and Eritrean refugees crossing from Egypt to Israel and Field Observers would alert our patrols day and night about infiltrated areas. Trackers are irreplaceable help in those areas of dry, hard soil with little vegetation.
When taxpayers' money goes to both Israel and Gaza, it does involve civilians
They missing the arm-rests for being strategic chairs...some people have no clue about military stuff in this sub ;P

Then I think the thousands of dead children in Gaza should get a Guinness world record for launching rockets before even turning 10. Grow a heart and a brain, there‚Äôs a goddamn genocide going on in the world that is being recorded on video.
If they launch rockets, it's a target. Grow a brain.
The explosion looks like it's coming from a charge in the water. Frame by frame you don't see anything come in and there is zero shrapnel or shell fragments to be seen spreading out in the water or the dirt next to it.
I think you are right‚Ä¶. For Israel it‚Äôs about survival. It‚Äôs sad that people in Gaza still support Hamas because of those terrorist group they are loosing their homes  and family.
The whole notion of "freedom" being distilled down to a one-dimensional value and ranked is rather odd. I don't really agree with trying to act like it's some numerated and objective term, certainly not worth having an argument about. Beside that, "average for europe" isn't a bad place to be despite the freedom thumping from the US. "Average for the world" definitely would be.One thing I think is worth complaining about for those indexes is how they look at the US. We're rather unique in structure with our state system, the end result under-scoring the reality of living here. One problem counts as everyone's problem, making our rating more of a "sum of worst parts" that doesn't actually reflect any individual's experience. It would be like rating all of the EU as one entity, a lack of a freedom in Bulgaria doesn't speak to life in Britain.Definitely not interested in a silly US vs EU argument like the other guy, just some thoughts.
Over the gap
What‚Äôs super fucked up is that Russia still denies the Circassians genocide.

Dehumanization of opponents is critical in war.  Israel is calling Palestinians all sorts of names:  Animals, Snakes, etc.You need to get the American public fired up to support another bloodbath of civilians in Gaza.  The tail continues to wag the dog.
My favorite part of the hospital case was how when the dust settled the hospital was fine and munition fragments carefully cleaned up by whoever has access to the area and benefits from them never being found.
a little F15 hud action? Dope
Lmao ofc that chud is a coward when confronted
This is a scouts unit! Highly skilled. They took losses Oct 7 and also saved many lives.
Hamas charter which citizens of Gaza voted for says kill all the Jews.Hamas has acted on its charter and performed a bunch of violence against the population in Israel. Israel is upset. Given the choice between having a prosperous area and calling for killing all the Jews the people of Gaza keep choosing the laterWhat would you do?
Oh so you're the type of person that thinks war crimes by X should be repaid repaid in genocide against Y? Are you mentally only 2yrs old?
If you guys want to learn more about the heroic deeds of these muslim and bedouin soldiers who saved lots of lives, I recommend watching [this](https://youtu.be/HxvQAFAY4fU?si=SUodUY67gjxJk9j8).
i think its funny they are not even tactical. these are strategic chairs. look at their construction. Normally a recon unity would have fold up chairs.
If the source is the same that claimed the 500s in the hospital right after it was hit, I'm sure it's a totally reliable source.Edit: to add more context.It's impossible to know the exact number of deaths so fast. In every tragedy, it takes days, even weeks to know the exact number, and all of the blue, Gaza knows the ID of every single person in the building minutes after the attack?"I don't know, Rick. It looks fake to me."
About the The Tracker Unit:    The tracker unit in the IDF was established in 1970. When the unit was established, it was deployed in the Negev, the Arava and the Sinai region and contained 5 companies. Today, the unit contains several hundred soldiers.   Soldiers in the unit get a full high school education and later on move on to Ben Gurion University after finishing their military service.The IDF's tracker unit operates from the northern border of the State of Israel to its southern border. Most of the unit's soldiers are Bedouin. The soldiers go through a reconnaissance course at the tracker school, and from there they are sent to units all over the country, along the northern border and on the border of the Gaza Strip. Many times the soldiers of the trackers unit have prevented the infiltration of suicide terrorists into Israeli territory with the help of early detection of footprints. The trackers patrol along Israel's borders in relentless search for terrorists, smugglers and infiltrators using advanced IDF technology, such as GPS, command and control systems, cameras, infrared systems and satellites. However, even in the 21st century, there are many who attach great importance to the keen senses of the Bedouin tracker, who performs the opening of an axis or blur trail along the perimeter fence. -Translated from Wikipedia with little corrections.
Wrong.
Damn they dint even flinch
Add some armrest, so the armchair generals can get a little of actual action in their lives.
I love how Israeli can‚Äôt see how brain washed they are grow up and admit that what u are doing to the Palestinians are wrong , don‚Äôt u ever wonder why a lot of people are siding with hamas?

Retreat to the south where Israel is bombing as well, right?
How exactly is hamas stopping them? Are they placing checkpoints or what exactly?
Sometimes some ethnic groups just have an insane advantage in certain theatres because they've lived there for generations and have dealt with things others wouldn't even think of.Look at the Gurkhas, they grow up in the Nepalise mountains, thinner air = better stamina and endurance because they simply need it to live. Stick that ability in a "normal" environment and its like the romans training with heavy swords so their real ones seemed light in comparison. Its one of the reassons the Argentinians got caught out in the Falklands because they assumed no person would have the endurance/fitness to cover such a large distance on foot in such short of a time
It sure does.
The chairs could be "leftovers" from the riots the Gazans did along the border.
Friendly neighborhood resistance murdering kids at festivals, throwing grenades into bombshelters and retreating behind their human shield to throw every palestinian under the train of return fire.
I‚Äôve been thinking this but couldn‚Äôt put it to words
I think Hamas stopping civilians from leaving might play a role in that
If they shoot rockets from an area with many civillians, it is a win-win-win for Hamas. possible outcomes:1: IDF strikes back, killing Hamas and civilians - win because this will turn the world against Israel (don't fool yourself to think Hamas care about Palestinian civilians) 2: IDF is deterred from retaliation because of the civilians - win because Hamas can attack freely without consequencesNo matter what happens, they get a chance to kill some random jew, which is the purpose of their existence.
If people are unhappy with wages they shouldn't take the job.A war in the middle east has nothing to do with civilians in the UK. Why don't you goto Gaza and help instead of protesting?
Time to retreat those 10 meters behind the wall
They hide in tunnels, Israel uses planes, wouldn‚Äôt you?
Why is he arrested? I thought this is what erdogan wants??
For real? That‚Äôs fascinating
Probably, we would never know for sure, both sides are going to try to make the numbers look good for their cause, so I won't believe any number coming from the IDF nor Hamas.
Which becomes a facility for producing biological munition, which may be thrown in enemy fortifications.
Yeah they‚Äôve tried and now paying the price, btw these Gazans aren‚Äôt originally Palestinian, they‚Äôre Egyptian, Jordanian and Syrian refugees, hence the names of their refugee camps.
I think it's often used as a sort of slang and not an official unit name. Either way, just pointing out that it might still be a mistranslation, just not a terrible one.
About the amount of them that didn‚Äôt retreat when told to.
Put some rollerblade wheels under the legs, it works in our office, at least.
[Proceeds to comment anyway]
They turn around like 'did that just happen? Okay, then, moving on'.
You do agree that the Muslim religion is a derivative of Judaism and did not exist before it right? Read your Bible please
Excuse me for not being more elaborate in my previous comment...I totally support the right to demonstrate, feel free to do so when you want/can. What I meant was that this whole situation is far more complex than these protests scream. From what I see it's mostly 'ISRAEL GENOCIDE' ... 'STOP THE GENOCIDE'... While it's clearly a war against Hamas. And a part of these Palestinians would gladly wipe Israel off the map, when it's Israel openly stating they're going to totally annihilate Hamas and it's support(ers). The hate flows both ways for decades now... It has become really, really complex. Deadly even. Do you really think Israel is going to quit this mission? All 'we' can do is hope they turn the down the volume, but that won't change Netanyahu's mission. Don't forget Hamas is actively shooting rockets, bullets into Israel as well.When you cannot win or find ways on emotional, personal level (STOP THE GENOCIDE)... Try looking at it in a political way on the longer run. Hamas and brothers, lots of Palestinians (lots 'in the West' too) want Israel dead, Israel doesn't want to die and is openly bombing on and about supposed valuable targets. I'm NOT supporting Israel bombing civilians, absolutely not. They should be held accountable for every innocent life they take. Hamas and it's supporters too, honestly. We all know these extremist groups couldn't care less about International Laws. I don't mind these groups being wiped off the world in a snap of the fingers...
*Local man learns about mortar existence*
Why is no one filling the streets saying release the hostages, dismantle Hamas, ceasefire, negotiate peace!Pro Palestine march away, but these people saying infintada, river to the see, delete all jews, by any means, etc. are literally handing the terrorists more than they ever hoped for. Innocent people dying in Gaza is awful, but I can't even imagine what kind of hell on earth empowered and justified terrorism will bring.
That'd be awful. This isn't the case. Read some history.I'd recommend you to start with how Palestine got his name. Also, who ruled that region before their independence. And don't forget to read about the population percentages right after their independence.Also, I'd recommend you to learn how old the modern countries surrounding the area are and how they were ruled before their independence.The migration movements all around the world in the 19th century will help you to understand this better.Bye.
They brought a couple of chairs for during lunchbreaks.
The homemade rockets they make by ripping water pipe infrastructure away from the civilians to wage war can explode multiple times. There not exactly precision munitions. In fact there are very inaccurate. An built with rudimentary knowledge of rocket science.

Yes
Let me repeat it. The units name literally is "[Desert Reconnaissance Battalion](https://www.facebook.com/idfonline/posts/the-desert-reconnaissance-battalion-demonstrated-outstanding-professionalism-dur/868671926489012/)" (unless you claim the offical IDF site itself is translating it wrong ...), not "Pathfinder Battalion". The translation is simply wrong.
They will get destroyed
If you remove the top lid it also becomes a bathroom
Looks staged
Not at all? Pathfinder is pretty synonymous for elite recon units in military speak.
And only One guy shooting standing fully upright and exposed. everyone else sauntering around like there's no danger. The exploding is behind the berm in the water so not like an rpg and wouldn't be in grenade range.
It means all the calls from the river to the sea which is a Palestinian call to eradicate all Jews from their land along with a religious ideology that is at odds with the Jewish faith is quite violent.  If you want a an idea what a Palestinian state covering all of Israel ( ignore the stolen Syrian land and Jordanian land as they are fine with not having that) then you just need to look back a couple of week to see how that looks.
When chaos gods came to lay claim on this wretched place, they thought we would fight each other to make this place either horny or bloodthirsty. On that glorious day we said "WHY NOT BOTH?"
Its just a terrible translation. The correct translation is "Reconnaissance". Its the 585th Desert Reconnaissance Battalion, part of Katif Brigade of the 143rd Division, IDF Southern Command.It is an ethnic minority unit consisting of volunteers from the Bedouin, Christian, Muslim, Druze and Circassian ethnoreligious groups. For much of its history the Desert Reconnaissance Battalion had been deployed to the dangerous Rafah Border Crossing. Five soldiers of the battalion were killed there in 2004, after which the Israeli newspaper Haaretz asked whether the unit had been assigned this post due to the perceived lower social standing of its soldiers.
Incorrect. Read your Bible please
Caption in top right reads "\[that\] was close :o "  The Bedouin trackers are some of the most hardened troops in the IDF. They are all career soldiers, not conscripts or reservists, and their specialized skills are in high demand in counter-terrorism activity even outside of major military operations.
You're probably wondering why the video quality is so bad.Well they downgrade the quality before releasing it to the press, so you wouldn't realize how much can actually be seen.
Most people are sympathetic to Palestinians. This sort of action makes people associate thuggery and violence with the peace movement. It‚Äôs regressive and unhelpful.
I like the tactical chairs! Should be mandatory in every infantry unit, running/walking/crouching is quite exhausting :)
Sure, no flinch and a couple of chairs in the trench. I am sure it's actual footage.
You know that is a bot you just answered
Considering how most of these guys live I understand why they didn‚Äôt even flinch from that. Balls of steel
It's more like "trackers" Battalion. The Bedouins are considered the best trackers.
Imagine if some one broke into your house and forced you to live in the closet while they lived in your house.Then everyone calls you w terrorist when you try to reclaim your house

Judging by their reaction on the explosion next to them, they're probably both.
It does seem super fake, like a static, distortion and technical difficulties screen being applied one camera feed and then other camera feed changing just screams of post production effect.
I'm pretty sure he wouldn't have made it over the bridge
‚ÄúPathfinder‚Äù doesn‚Äôt sound like a Battalion id want to be in. You‚Äôd have to be nuts or have balls of steel to be first in anywhere.
Not a single flinch.  These guys are going to make sure the butcher‚Äôs bill gets paid in full.
I‚Äôd buckle up then slam on the breaks.
no problem
Haha I‚Äôm surprised its still up they must‚Äôve not seen it, the sub Im talking about in my previous comment was ThereWasAnAttempt which has a genocidal slogan on their banner.
‚ÄúToo many laws‚Äù and still the highest gun homicide rate of any western nation
The propaganda odds, that is. If I were a betting man, I'd bet on Israel winning this fight on the ground.
Have you considered that you might be wrong?
Have you had your Break-in today..
To send a message to the British government, cuz they're big part of the problem
I think genocide is a pretty solid reason as well
Did you protest against Hamas? What a ludicrous comment.
It‚Äôs their responsibility not to restrict access as they control access.Would you think it‚Äôs reasonable that a city if two million people in the US has food, water, electricity and medicine cut off because the US military, for example, killed thousands of innocent civilians in another country?
They can't move the rockets around easily without being detected. They aren't all stored in some apartment. The logistics of moving and preparing the rockets for a launch are likely very difficult.
I will be looking forward to seeing some of this. It would be awesome to see some tunnel clearing
How many civilians have been killed just in the strikes on buildings in this video?
No, the bots are definitely not on Palestines side. Any time I point out Israeli brutality I get either downvotes or the most reductive possible replies. Won't stop me from doing it tho. Maybe it's just this sub."Dont you guys know Hamas would kill the people defending them!!?""Hamas are such cowards, using human shields!!!11!!""Terrorist sympathizer!!!""stop supporting radical violence against Israel!!!"&amp;#x200B;Very depressing tbh because I feel like most of them are actual humans who can have children...
Not gonna comment so I don't get banned
Hamas are extremely religious and want all heretics eradicated.
It goes against the narrative (the lie) that Israeli Arabs can normally live their life if they don't support Hamas. Arabs in Israel are in constant danger however as shown here, this is nothing new.
Pretending a war in the Middle East isn't good for their war in Ukraine.

It won‚Äôt have such a big effect on McDonald‚Äôs bottom line. McD is more of a real estate company than a burger joint.Practically all McDonald‚Äôs restaurants are not operated by McD.

Israel has a propaganda advantage? Mate, Israel has been blamed by the entire world due to Hamas propaganda "500 killed in Israeli airstrike on Hospital". The odds are against the Israelis.
Ya sure use wtvr words makes your brain happy. I just want to hear you say that you condemn the actions of the extremists in Gaza. If you can't do that, I know I'm not arguing with a real human.

Name one thing they've done that's targeting "the government" wtf they lob rockets into cities how exactly is that targeting government. They literally kidnapped over 200 civilians, some of whom are Americans. Do you believe that to be government targeting and justified as well? I swear people are losing their minds
Glad I found your comment, not removed and even with some upvotes. Faith in rationality restored
Gaza is 25 miles by 12 miles with a population of 2 million, half of which are children. I personally don't believe the narrative that Isreal is giving in regards to Hamas using civilians as human shields strictly because it makes no sense. I believe Isreal is just saying this because they know that everytime they bomb a location they have a 50% chance of killing women and kids so to justify their attacks they deflect blame to Hamas. Alot of the men fighting in Hamas probably grew up in Gaza and were radicalized by Israeli strikes killing their family members. It makes no logical sense that they would then turn around and use their friends and families as humam shields.
well i think that guy is some kinda *driven agenda pusher* but i'll agree this footage is propaganda, under the definition of "media intended to influence perception"all media has some degree of deception and story telling, what's not in any shot is just as important as what's in it, but propaganda can be deceptive or truthful in its message and information conveyed.i too would be very curious to see what hamas would release for propaganda right now.  from the sounds and occasionally disappearing buildings in the live stream i can't imagine they're doing great, but i also know idf isn't gonna post footage of themselves getting ambushed or fucking up massively, whereas hamas absolutely would if they had some.i'm rooting idf, but i always favor me getting more information.
Wow look at all those boots on the ground!

Elon is a twitter attention whore if you haven't realized that yet I dunno what to tell you. "Proof of propaganda" lol, really countries have propaganda? I am utterly shocked, shocked I tell you. You know who else has propaganda? Hamas, and their stupid ass thought committing crimes against humanity and uploading it for the whole world to see was a great idea.
Wow... I'm hoping he just slipped on through down to the water. But still, the boat's RIGHT THERE so he'd better get out of the way. I'm worried there are a bunch of gears there he got pulverized through, hit his head on a beam below, or (hopefully) managed to land safely on a beam and crawl to safety.
Incorrect. McDonald's is paid fees as a % of sales. Sales sure as hell is affected when the windows are smashed and they have to close for cleanup (plus the bad image and increased awareness from word of mouth on why this happened).
Probably would've made it too if he didn't ride almost parallel with the massive fucking crack in the floor.
So, why is Elon offering it? Is he just looking for clout, or is there real damage to Palestine's infrastructure? Why is proof of a propaganda campaign irrelevant? Do you think they stopped it?

You are misreading the table.First, you are ignoring the 15% from North Africa.Second, the table only refers to *paternal* ancestral background, i.e. where people or their fathers were born from. This means you are ignoring the people whose parents were already born in Israel (37% of Israeli Jews).The relevant info is this part:&gt; There are no government statistics categorizing Israeli Jews as "Ashkenazi", "Mizrahi", etc, but studies and estimates have been conducted.[42][43] In a 2019 study, in a sample meant to be representative of the Israeli Jewish population, **about 44.9% percent of Israel's Jewish population were categorized as Mizrahi (defined as having grandparents born in North Africa or Asia), **31.8% were categorized as Ashkenazi** (defined as having grandparents born in Europe, the Americas, Oceania and South Africa), **12.4% as "Soviet"** (defined as having progenitors who came from the ex-USSR in 1989 or later), about 3% as Beta Israel (Ethiopia) and 7.9% as mix of these, or other Jewish groups.[44] Note that this methodology is not fool-proof: See for example Bulgarian or Greek Jews, who would be categorized as Ashkenazi according to this definition, although they are overwhelmingly Sephardic.
Musk promised Starlink to Palestine. I wonder if they will be able to release any footage. Israel has a huge propaganda advantage right now. I'm just trying to get in before the bots. https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-23695896

Bob the builder character lookin ass
It‚Äôs astounding how they refuse to believe there is any astroturfing on the pro-Palestine side. Ignoring how every major subreddit is flooded with pro-Palestine propaganda.
Now that you say it, it suddenly makes sense why they move super slow in a column in hostile territory.
The headline will be "Israeli airstrike kills innocent family of 10" and there will need to be another mass demonstration in central London by all the very well integrated Muslims there, chanting for jihad.
I totally forgot those even existed
Mostly because people are trying to conflate Hamas = Palestinian so noone questions Israeli war crimes and deliberate targeting of civilians. Back with ISIS that wasn't the case as people realized that the people in ISIS territories were suffering just as much from ISIS rule, but understand that even then civilians were going to die regardless of what you did. That isn't the case here where Israeli's have been deliberately bombing the shit out of civilian areas without much care as to what happens to the civilian population, combined with how they have treated Palestinians for the past 80 odd years.
&gt;Yes we exist.Good thing your existence is irrelevant and will not change the outcome of this conflict.
This reminds me how Powel had 3D renders of Sadams chemical warfare trailers, when he had his power point at the UN when he unloaded a bag of lies. If you come with 3D renders as a justification for war, you're trying too hard because you're full of shit. When you have real reasons, you don't need a fancy light show.
The atomic bombs ended the war.  The Japanese were savage, does the rape of Nanjing ring any bells?  This whataboutism is stupid
As outside observers we can be arbiters with being enablers
Russia is also famously pro-stoking the fires of chaos in the West, they play both sides to cause maximum unrest.
What‚Äôs worse is Americans claiming it‚Äôs inhumane, coming from the country that didn‚Äôt hold back in bombing Kids in Afghanistan and Syria. And let‚Äôs not forget dropping two atomic bombs that killed 300k Japanese on the spot
Its the opposite in fact. The ppl running errands for russia and Iran are the dense ones.
Historically there is unfortunately a lot of troubling president starting with the Palestinian refusal to acknowledge an isreal state. Personally, I support a two state solution. It would have to enforced by a body of nations maybe the U.N., something divorced of the highly partisan ideology of both sides and the regions that support them. In Palestine‚Äôs case the Arab world, with isreal the western world. What has been the status quo in the past cannot be the allowed to continue. Suffering on both sides is never ending and justified by centuries old religious dogma and salt is being poured on the wounds for current generations serving the interests of nobody.
That not premature , that‚Äôs IDF tech the US troops in Afghanistan wish they had
I somehow doubt you think the same of Taiwan.

Most of this "hacked TV BROADCAST" are not live but just edited vids of the Recordings
* How would you name the defacto Gaza government, territory and it's people who are living totally different than the Palastines in the West bank with a different government that actually has agreement with Israel and others and have removed killing all Jews and destroying Israel vs other Palestines living for generations in other countries?* The UN has a terrible record for anything related to Israel https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestine_and_the_United_Nations they occupy the most UN resolutions over a hundred vs just a couple for countries that literally kill their own people. The UN schools teach hate and killing
Iran/Russia/many more affiliates attempt to create a Muslim world vs Israel/West.Edit: I just got banned for this comment. Interesting times.
Jfc Hamas themselves brag about doing it. They are actual psychopathic evil terrorists. Doesn‚Äôt make everything Israel does good but Hamas is objectively worse. https://www.telegraph.co.uk/world-news/2023/10/10/eu-funded-water-pipelines-hamas-rockets/
We're the good guys, look at the people they kidnapped!
Can't wait to see all over tiktok about how Israel is now planting bombs in the west bank
Nah.
Interesting they did not protest Hamas after they intentionally murdered over a thousand Israelis.
D-9 dozer is $150/hr for civilian work. Combat pay in the field? The ~~skies~~ Trench Is the limit!
As an able bodied American I know I will never be arrested in whatever town this is. It‚Äôs like flag football out there
I understand where your coming from, what do you suggest be done then. Should Hamas be allowed to freely attack Israel? The reason many israel√≠ people haven‚Äôt been killed is because of their iron dome.
Oh neat. I'll add that to my mental list.
Exacty. No other nation gets judged as hard for defending against terrorists as Israel. If this was France or Britain combating deranged Sunni jihadists you‚Äôd see 10% of the ‚Äúoooooo open air prison carpet bombing wah wah wah‚Äù  I‚Äôve never before heard idiots demanding that the attacked nation must immediately provide fuel and supplies to their attackers
&gt;You all deserve to be put down fast and hard. Nothing justifies raping, burnin, and slaughtering innocent people.So desperate to find the highest moral groundüò≠ü§£.. anyways thats what your Israeli soldiers do, getting in to Palestinians homes and forcing their women to undress in front of their families or force Palestinians out of their homes in West bank and let the new Jewish settlers take it.

But sadly the chaos can't be stopped and sometimes the whole nation has to suffer the bad actions of their government and I don't care since there are many Israelis that turn blind eye to all that too and don't feel affected by it so good if H\*mas even unintentionally ki\*led them through rockets or shot them unintentionally.  &gt;And I hope what ever governing body you live under or mussad/CIA track your ass down.They can't do shit where I'm ü§£
Yes but thats there job.
At What cost? D-9 Dozers don't work for free. This is a payin' gig.
THANK YOUI don't ask random Jews to condemn Israel bombing my dad's operating room mid surgery or using him as a literal human shield like dragged around by an IDF soldier style shield.Why should I? That's ridiculous.
Could be a radio activated IED.If the convoys uses a jammer, the jammer could just a false-activate the explosion
It's amazing that people don't know how franchises work
You know d-9s job is de-mining right?
Why didn't you mention the fact that those are Jews standing for Palestine? It doesn't support a certain narrative, does it?
Oh boy... Bulldozing the above ground structures is easy. The de-tunneling and de-mining fees are what eats into your overhead cost.

It is in no way clear that the majority of Western citizens support Palestine. And I cannot abide the religious intolerance, male domination, political repression, and medieval violence that permeates much of the Muslim world.Understand this: liberal and empathetic values and tolerance for non conformity do not exist in these cultures. You are siding with people who would not tolerate you in their country.
Did they give him a blue and white chicken sandwich wrapper?
Sure but could you clarify the rules, is it the extremists in Israel dismantled their country's own supreme court and get billions of dollars every year in financial and military aid every year and is overwhelmingly supported the world's most powerful countries? Or a different one?
Can't idf just find every exit and blockade the tunnels until they all starve?
Fuck hamas, better get rid of them now than to suffer later again.
That's true but, Hamas is targeting government as whole and Israel should be targeting Hamas. But decision was every Palestinian = Hamas -&gt; free cannonfire and slaughter. It's no better than USA going to Iraq for 9/11, and for still unconfirmed claims of weapons, which were never found. Only difference being genocide vs overthrowing government.
Anything to dehumanize..üòî
Its a psyop war trying to influence you to hate Israel.

Look at this guy, he wants the people under apartheid to "not suck" and be like all cool and chill with their oppressors
Wrong. Palestinian leadership have proven to be terrorists. Gaza has Hamas and West Bank has the pay for slay system.How about retiring both so they can work on peace with israel?
Too many Zionists in this thread.
Looks a little fake to me...any other sources besides this?
Did you miss the part where he told him ‚Äúyou can wave your Palestine flag, say death to the Jews, whatever you want‚Äù?
Israel is hated by almost every Middle Eastern country in the region. Hell the reason this attack even happened was because Israel was beginning to normalize relations with Saudi Arabia and other countries.  That's why Hamas (funded by Iranian weapons and money) did the attack.Iran has a ton of money and could easily be astroturfing.
Literally this post
No way both sides hate each other, who would have thought?
When they bomb the hospital there was a giant secondary explosion and it wasn‚Äôt from a couple oxygen tanks
let's play a game. I'll say the extremists on the Israel side suck, but there are a majority who are not like them, if you say the extremists on the Palestinian side sucks, but there are a majority who are not like them.
I find it crazy people are copping shit for cheering an army killing terrorists with the exact same belief as ISIS. no one cared about the civilian casualties during the ISIS days? why has everyone clambered onto a high horse about em now? and just so you know, every time you tell me Israel is committing genocide and that Palestine should be "free", super man comes down and rescues one more Palestinian child from the clutches of evil and we all live happily ever after.
The babies did stay home
Cyclist.
Nah I didn‚Äôt call Hamas freedom fighters, I called the man defending his land against an occupying military a freedom fighter, because that‚Äôs what he is, no matter what brainwashed or propaganda fed people like you say.There‚Äôs no Palestinian side that wants to ‚Äúkill all Jews‚Äù, I'm not sure where this is coming from, because it doesn‚Äôt matter whether it‚Äôs Jews, Muslims or Christians occupying his lands and oppressing him, he sure will want to fight back.
Oct 6th the count was 0/0. Post Oct 7th is entirely due to Hamas, so your anger is misplaced.
Why doesn‚Äôt the media splash this all over the news like they do with Arabs chanting death to the Jews? I‚Äôm so over Western media. It needs a complete overhaul.
The IDF never went out, and that‚Äôs why the Second Intifada happened, literally.
Why should it be equal?  That‚Äôs stupid. If Palestine stayed home on Oct 7th the count would be 0/0. Feel better now?
why? didnt britain ‚Äúgifted‚Äù the Zionists the land?
Well. You see. Palestine *is* free. So we can take it without paying with huge bulldozers only we use
You should read a little bit
They‚Äôre so desperate, couldn‚Äôt get into Gaza so they went to the West Bank. üòÇüòÇ. Looks like there are no more hospitals or journalists to bombe in Gaza üòÇ
Ukraine didn't cross the border and kill civilians before Russia attacked
Supporters of a terrorist regime who refuse to leave an area they know will be bombed win the Darwin award.
How does that work? What about using a mechanical pressure fuse instead?
The guy is doing good thing with bad reason.
Because they are.
People seem to forget that their nations current boarders were defined by \*gasp\* WAR.... or the peace agreements made after wars by people that didn't represent them and they sometimes didn't have a say in where the line was drawn.The Palestinians gambled and lost in wars for the last 70 years. You would think it would make then try to regain territory at the negotiating table, but instead they keep doubling down... sadly they will end up as a nation-less people like the Roma or the Kurds.&amp;#x200B;I consider Gaza to be a city-state with its own authoritarian government, social services and military. They invaded and declared war on their much stronger neighbor with no real end goal in sight... its just madness and sad.Two brothers fighting over a tiny sliver of land in the desert.
The only defense would be they've dropped leaflets and made calls to citizens in attempt to warn them to leave.The sad part is, most of these people wish for all jews and all infidels to be eradicated from this earth. They are the same people in interviews wearing green in support and cheering on the radical government.If they don't, and aren't in support they are exterminated anyways.The reason you see so many children dying in Gaza is because of failed parenting. These people would rather let everyone they "love" die than flee/change their opinions on the jews.It's fucked either way. No one wins in war.
Especially the birds. Because they are like totally a thing. The rumor that they aren‚Äôt real is not true. Thus, none of these birds could have been used for any spying. For Mossad or any other intelligence agency. Especially not from one halfway across the world with a 3 letter acronym. Period. End of story. (mission accomplished)
Stupidity at its finest then get your ass out of London and go free Palestine give em a hand why don‚Äôt you

What about hamas? Nobody cares? Ah yeah you can not negotiate with terrorists.
You‚Äôre right Palestinians in Gaza don‚Äôt have the resources to do that; but Iran, China, and Russia do.
One of the mods on here is muslim same thing on another sub that I can‚Äôt remember, Im sure this will be removed too but only pro Palestine comments are allowed lol
Except one side is state sponsored
yup, that's why Palestine overwhelmingly gets billions of dollars every year in financial and military aid every year and is overwhelmingly supported the world's most powerful countries. Because Palestinian side is excused.
Israel literally pays people to make positive comments about it online and funds bot farms. Somehow I don‚Äôt think Palestinians in Gaza have the same resources to do it to the extent Israelis do
If the people running Gaza allowed aid and development to be used for its intended purpose to benefit the people of Gaza instead of digging up newly installed water pipes to make more rockets so that McDonalds could be built in Gaza I‚Äôd bet they‚Äôd be giving out free meals to Gazans too. The state of infrastructure and quality of life in Gaza is even more the fault of Hamas than it is Israel
Holy fuck.  *That* is what you're leaning on here?  I *deleted my comment*? Hahahaha, unreal.
Hamas charter calls for genocide of Jews. The original Charter identified Hamas as the Muslim Brotherhood in Palestine and declares its members to be Muslims who "fear God and raise the banner of Jihad in the face of the oppressors." The charter states that "our struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious" and calls for the eventual creation of an Islamic state in Palestine, in place of Israel and the Palestinian Territories,[3] and the obliteration or dissolution of Israel.[4][5] It emphasizes the importance of jihad, stating in article 13, "There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors."
Could someone for the love of god explain what the fuck is happening in the Middle East!? Im hearing Israel‚Äôs good israels bad Palestine this hamas that.
Depending on the initiator, the lead vehicle likely set it off with whatever c-ied jammer it's running.
Why was the person recording this on camera phone?
Some sources said almost half a million people protested. 9 were arrested. That's what you focused on. I was going to respond with something to engage in a discussion about why these protests are even needed but saw your post history and realized it is a moot point.

The government of Gaza has declared war on Israel and invaded, slaughtering indiscriminately. Israel is invading Gaza in response. It‚Äôs likely that by the time Israel is done Hamas as an entity will not exist in Gaza any longer
Send them back to Gaza to defend it.

Hamas charter calls for eliminating Israel. From the river to the sea- sound familiar?  That ISA a call for genocide against Israel and Jews.  The dirty Palestinians are using the US Democratic party tactics of accusing your enemy of what you are actually doing.
It's still going to be an absolute bloodbath for everyone involved, clearing those tunnels is not going to be easy no matter how advanced the tools. I do fully expect horrifying images robot killers walking over fresh corpses in cramped dark concrete tunnels probably before Christmas.
Hamas leaders can make more money when their people are killed. That‚Äôs why. https://en.globes.co.il/en/article-the-phenomenal-wealth-of-hamas-leaders-1000957953
The Palestinians who protest the war in Gaza don't exist because they know they'll be immediately murdered if they try.
And the extremists in Gaza are supported by the UN, who continually screech at Israel to cease defending itself while blithely handing over endless supplies to Hamas. And they won't even allow their people to say anything about it, just recently Hamas rolled up and took a bunch of supplies from UNRWA intended for Palestinian civilians, and when they tweeted about it in alarm someone higher up the chain clearly took notice and made them delete the tweet. They now claim it didn't happen, presumably because they know a solid chunk of their aid is going straight to Hamas and either don't care or don't want to admit it.
Good point, I guess the extremists' behavior on the Palestinian side is excused, my bad.
Yeah, but when you do that people will just say you should be protesting for something else or advocating for better wages in a different way.
Jesus, as if this thread wasn't already such a fucking mess
Ohh is that like the 20th or something
&gt; which **less** me to believe&gt; your numerous misspellings, and grammatical/punctuation errorsThe irony isn't lost.
I totally agree objectively - if Israel had wanted Hamas out they would‚Äôve held off invading bombing etc and they would‚Äôve allowed the people of Palestine to determine their fate. Instead they started to bomb a regime that would amount to 5 years old voting in 2007 for them to be in power and Israel backed them. They never wanted a peaceful solution. Simply genocide.
And from that source, 45% are from North African or Asian background (where their parents come from)So I belive point still very much stands. To try blame this on Europeans is ignorant.
Break me off a piece of that Palestine
The fuck are you talking about?
What the fuck does this sentence even mean?
What a weird and non-fitting analogy.
They are in the wrong location
Traveling to Japan while Obama was president, I was amazed at how negatively the Japanese people viewed the US action in Iraq/Afghanistan.I don't think they were pro Taliban, but they were definitely more empathetic to the civilian plight in those regions than the US view of 'the end justifies the means, to the ends of the earth'. It was a good reminder that the US consensus viewpoint is not necessarily the world consensus viewpoint. Twenty years later many Americans view the US action in the middle east as misguided. Terrorism is horrific and must be condemned and acted against with conviction. It isn't clear what the extent or impact of Israel's actions will be, but there is a point where those actions will become too costly in collateral damage and consequences and will be regretted.
That doesn‚Äôt make sense. And furthermore why are trying to justify killing by either side?
Invasion of Germany was genocide!!!  Those poor German people!  They hadn‚Äôt elected nazi‚Äôs in over 10 years, they were blameless!!!
Hamas needs to go away, therefore commit genocide on a population of civilians who are not Hamas with indiscriminate attacks?Think about what you said a little closer to home. Do you think the average Americans should be genocided because some other Americans have fucked up values and twisted ideas?
Love to see it in Britain

Ummm, to put it in perspective where else are they going to operate? It is literally a prison population. Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right and even if isreal kills every last child is Gaza they will have only sealed their fate in history. And have succeeded in uniting all the enemies of American and our ideals. This whole blind support of something so catastrophic is beyond imagination. 6 billion dollars to 8 million people for 2023 and for what? Israel‚Äôs own population doesn‚Äôt support its government‚Äôs actions as much as people in the United States do.

Have you ever wondered why israel even has the ability to control a country‚Äôs food electricity and water?

Yes
It excercises restraint while displacing planestinians from their homes without legal right? How is that right in any sense? There are extremists groups in all nations, but it doesn't mean society as a while needs to carry the burden of the actions of those groups and suffer the consequences of their actions. Land and property have been overtaken from Palestinians from Israeli settlers. It's been going on for decades. If the military came into your house and forced you out, you would be angered, too. Hate begets hate. It's a continuous cycle. This needs to stop

You made my point. It has never existed as an independent country. The closest it's ever been is after ww2 when their territory was carved out. Since then they've squandered what they have with constant attempts to kill christians and jews and every time they try they lose more and more territory. This latest uprising being no different.
Hamas isn‚Äôt a military. They hide among civilians. Look at Ukraine. Their army doesn‚Äôt hide amongst their civilians. That is a big difference. If the Hamas criminals involved in the slaughter cared about their families they wouldn‚Äôt hide amongst them. They would still be in Israel fighting.
Welcome to war, people die no matter what civilians will always be caught within the crossfire
It's also asinine to say that Israel is allowed to occupy Gaza but has no responsibility to keep the Gazans aliveAnd before some idiot tells me that ackshually they aren't "physically" in Gaza: imagine I call the cops on you and they surround your house and point guns at every entrance, exit, window, and chimney you own. But instead of demanding you exit with your hands above your head, they tell you to stay inside or be killed. Under no circumstance will you be allowed to leave. At some point you get desperate and dig a tunnel to freedom, but instead of the sun shining on you at the other side you see a cop with a gun drawn. **You are occupied.** The least they can do is not turn off your water.

60% of the Israel' as population is Arab/North African. It might not hurt to get off of reddit with your larp activism and read a fucking book.
"Allowed humanitarian support" You mean like 10 trucks a day? When most NGOs are stating that number needs to be tenfold to even come close to what Gaza needs daily.
So instead of targeting the guy who shot at you, you just bomb the whole fucking place? That's terrorism bitch
Nah. They wouldn't do shit if not for big brother over here.

I thought Hamas was the problem. But it's on Palestinians and even Lebanon now. Pretty much like "we can't find em  so we'll just bomb the fuck outta everything we don't like. Why not attack Iran? They're the supposed financing behind Hamas?
Welcome to censorship
According to this guy, yes.
I remember the first 24 hours after October 7th. Reddit was so bloodthirsty. I saw some awful takes wanting Palestinians erased from the planet. It's weird seeing so much support all of a sudden.
Indians were here way before any of us. You point is moot.
Israel is over 3000 years old. Jesus walked the streets I‚Äôd isreal. Then napoleon kicked them out of them land when he raided it, then the Roman‚Äôs did it and they finally got their land back after they were killed off in an actual genocide in ww2. Palestine is about 2000 years old. Simple math. Do some research before you sound stupid like this

Someone here with a brain. Thank god. No one was crying when hamas mowed down a whole music festival full of innocent people but Israel reacts in defense and now they are the bad people. People are a joke these days
So is every instance of war necessarily genocide?Was the allied bombing of germany during the second world war genocide?

It‚Äôs definitely fair to demand people in Western countries holding signs that say ‚Äúresistance isn‚Äôt terrorism‚Äù to condemn Hamas. What‚Äôs not fair is demanding any random Palestinian/Arab/Muslim person to condemn Hamas just because they are Palestinian/Muslim/Arab. That‚Äôs the distinction.

Merriam-Webster: the deliberate and systematic destruction of a racial, political, or cultural group.In Israel/Palestine, Hamas and Israel both are actively doing this. However only one side is actually having success.
That‚Äôs what I thought. Why waste a $120k AIM-120, when a $70K Shafir / Python will do.
Uhhh‚Ä¶. That‚Äôs hawt‚Ä¶.
THE OPRESSED BECOME THE OPRESSORS RIGHT BEFORE OUR EYES.
I never said that those numbers were accurate. I‚Äôm not pro hamas or pro IDF. All you have to to do is watch the uncensored videos on ync.com and Kaotic.com. I don‚Äôt listen to any propaganda from mainstream media.
üéâ
i feel like they should also protest hamas.
Yes, under international law it is their responsibility. Due to their blockade of gaza and their control of what flows in and out of it, Israel is considered an occupying force. They are responsible for the well being of the citizens under their occupation.
Do you condemn the Ethiopian government for their atrocities?
Oh.  Yeah I saw on a modern airliner just a sliding panel, didn't know there was a bunch of stuff inside solely dedicated to thrust reversal.  Was wondering how the vector worked out.  Panel is on engine side and you need the air to go forward.
No one is asking Israel to provide it, they're asking Israel to let it get through. Let the UN provide it. And collective punishment is illegal under international law. You can't punish a people for their government, especially when 1/2 population is under 18 and Hamas was elected in 2006 after which they ended all elections.
I‚Äôm interested in seeing what the end game is. These parents losing their kids in either Israel or Palestine will just add more soldiers, hatred, and war. To what end? Iran will just keep funneling weapons in for those that survive. I‚Äôm no expert but wondering how and where this ends.
How tf do people in London have any control over that whatsoever. Hamas is an authoritarian terror group whose leadership lives in Qatar. The entire Palestinian Diaspora could make that demand in Unison and have it make no difference whatsoever.
I‚Äôm glad they‚Äôre protesting in London against a war in a completely different country while remaining completely silent and making slightly angry tweets when our government actively skull fuck us day in day out
Ah so peaceful.
But don‚Äôt condemn Israel right?
Yes and at the expense of 2 million (half children) people right? When you say shit like this you‚Äôre simply telling on yourself that Palestinian life does not have equal value to Israeli life
Fuck around and find out works everywhere
Job security, baby!
I blame Nebuchadnezzar II.

You can‚Äôt veto if your entire govt was killed in a decaptation strike hehe(Please US do the funni)
Actually that is not the definition of genocide.... Also violence if people don't do something is more relevant now towards Hamas considering they stopped people from leaving the north to go south... Can't have their meat Shields running away
A democracy just like America apparently
Nice victim blaming. Chefs kiss.
Not sure what the missile is, but its most likely IR.  Most modern planes have the capability to track targets using radar in a sort of short range mode to then fire IR guided missiles at them or use guns even while maintaining a radar lock to track the target.

France played a role, but not as significant a role as the UK.
I think the hope is that the Western so-called "democracies" might actually listen to their own citizens for a change and stop supporting Israel's genocidal regime.
So you went into gaza and counted all the casualties yourself? You are just making shit up.
The source is me dumbass . With you sitting at home in your moms basement , I‚Äôm on the other side of the world and I know what‚Äôs going on.
Ah, yes! Lets drop bombs on all the women and children so Hamas can't harm them anymore (Israeli logic).
You‚Äôre actually lying when you say that. Ppl in this thread can‚Äôt be that dense.
So all the children murdered by Israel were Hamas too or what are you calling for except for continuing the genocide?
It's the weekend dummy.

Arabs and Jews have been trying to eradicate each other for thousands of years. Now it‚Äôs just on social media.
btw of this very serious and brilliant post, it was ultra cringy and deranged of UN, NATO and EU to keep veto after thousands of years of experience what happens when you have veto in your country's system (i.e 3 partitions of Poland) and modern examples of problematic asshats like Turkey in NATO, Hungary in EU and Russia in UN.

Improve your security if it's so easy for your enemy to take your people hostage.
Who said that? The USA? Cause that's a lie. Regan negotiated with Iran through Isreal to release the hostages.
The UN surveyed everyone who supports the "free Palestine" movement?
Jet fighter's don't have the equipment to redirect the flow of exhaust like airliners do. It's a different style of jet engine.On old turbojet airliner's (and some bizjets), you'd see a bucket like contraption that physically comes down the end of the engine to redirect the exhaust. Modern airliners have panels that slide open on the engines and internal systems that redirect the flow.Thrust reversal systems are also fairly large and complex and it just isn't worth the extra weight and complexity on jet fighters. If needed, they use drogue chutes and/or airbrakes (large flaps that extend during landing) though chutes are not seen a lot in modern jets AFAIK.\*There ARE some rare exceptions though. The Panavia Tornado DOES have reverse thrust braking in order to allow it to land on short runways. That's the only small military jet I can think of that does it. Happy to have anyone jump in with any other examples though.
Most immigrated as recently as their Jewish neighbors. Palestine was a backwater of the Ottoman Empire for a long time before a wave of (relatively) capital-rich Jews immigrated from Russia after a wave of pogroms. Arabs from surrounding regions moved in then began discriminating against the legal, productive immigrants that were responsible for the economic opportunities that led them there.Were those earliest Jews somehow at fault for legally immigrating and buying land to live on?
It does get tossed around a lot these days, but in this case it's pretty hard to argue that it isn't genocide. The UN genocide convention lists 5 acts, one of which is "imposing living conditions intended to destroy the group". Denying access to food, water, and medicine is most definitely genocide.
There are extremists on both sides
Like in 6th century BC you mean? It was called Judea back then, fyi.
Must have been hard for you to conduct such a detailed survey during such a time of chaos.
Why don't you set an example and rally people to protest for wages?

If you want to get back hostages alive, yes you do.
Super proud of London
Good.
We just need to have a figurehead to take the fall for Russia admitting defeat, accepting responsibility for the 2022 Invasion of Ukraine, and the Balkanization of the Russian Federation.  Afterwards, Kaliningrad can be left as a rump state to whatever end.That was a major error of the treaties that ended WW1.  The Kaiser's government was displaced without being made to accept responsibility for what it had done, instead the fragile democratic(ish...) Weimar government was left holding that bag and had many unnecessary problems as a result.
what the hell happened here
Those people already fucking lived there.
Go to Palestine and fight. Why are you slapping British police!? Such emotional fools. Just lashing at a person in uniform over a foreign war is ridiculous. When Ukraine was invaded no one attacked British police. If you feel strongly about the war go there and help!
Is that when Kaliningrad starts recognizing parts of Western Poland as being historically Kaliningrad?
Most reasonable people are not really arguing the last point. People seemingly are disagreeing with methodology and acceptable collateral murder/damage.
They were too busy celebrating
Fucking animals
Sorry but is it really israels responsibility to provide food, electricity and water to the group of people who are actively trying to kill every single jew in israel? The group who continues to launch rockets indiscriminately against israel? The group who just went in and slaughtered over 1000 innocent people in their homes? Hamas is the government, maybe they should actually give the food they have kept for themselves to the people of gaza. Same for fuel.

Day old accounts spreading rhetoric and propaganda shouldn't be missed
Why would 'israeli' be uncapitalized and in quotes?Rhetorical question.
But have you condemned Hamas today?
1) Invade Kaliningrad and establish a pro-West government.2) Recognize new Kaliningrad government as legitimate seat of Russian state.3) Profit.
I‚Äôm condemning my own mother

But, have you condemned Hamas today?
Well, here‚Äôs a scaled down, toned down version of the ‚Äúfree Palestine‚Äù you want so much. There‚Äôs a good reason why no Muslim country  wants them.

Are the mods removing pro Israel or pro Palestine comments?
Why are you assuming they are European? A massive proportion of the Jewish Israeli population came from Arab majority countries. Just sounds like you don't know what your talking about and pushing a pretty disgusting bias.
Just going to mention that the Israeli minister for National security Ben-Gvir is a right wing pro settler and has been convicted of incitement to racism, destroying property, possessing a terror organization's propaganda material and supporting a terror organization.  He was **convicted** in **Israel** for these crimes and is now in charge of this "war".
That gets you screwed all around the world.

Saying it‚Äôs obvious and by looking at destruction you say it‚Äôs conclusive, Is wrong, you are wrong. It‚Äôs not obvious and the destruction doesn‚Äôt mean those numbers are accurate. You obviously haven‚Äôt been paying attention to what‚Äôs been going on besides reading crap.  It doesn‚Äôt take a rocket surgeon to do some impartial homework. Let me guess you‚Äôre a free Palestine down with Israel person aren‚Äôt you ?    Trust me when I say this and I can‚Äôt say why I know or how (don‚Äôt really care if you trust me or not) but those numbers are not accurate at all. Not even close especially the children number.
1.3 million Muslims in London 100,000 seems light
Also ¬´genocide¬†¬ª ?
It was more the chaos and ethnic rivalries and ambitions in the region after the fall of the ottoman empire, but it simplifies it and is convieniant to just say "derp the British did it" because then that takes the agency and guilt away from actual people doing the killing.
I've seen videos that say otherwise. Israel is using bunker busters that are effective against Hamas tunnels.
Yeah and the WHO because they would never inflate numbers about stuff. üôÑ Fairy world lol how about you get out of it.   I can tell you for a fact, those numbers are not accurate . I can‚Äôt tell you how or why I know but trust me when I say this (or don‚Äôt I could give two shits) those are fact numbers.
1. This is not a genocide by even the most generous use of the term.2. Is that REALLY what they are ALL demanding? Is that Israel stop firing on Gaza. There's no other extra motives in there? Are we suuuuuuuure about that?
I‚Äôm confused are you on his side? I really need to sleep
Did he survive or did the bridge squash him? Looks like a bad crack to fall in!
The Israeli army ordered more than 1 million people(half the pop)to leave northern Gaza within 24 hours, in advance of an imminent military ground operation. This amounts to forcible transfer and is illegal under international law ‚Äì and impossible to implement safely.The number of people who have fled their homes in Gaza is estimated at about one million. This includes over 580,000 people staying in UN-run emergency shelters in increasingly dire conditions.Despite telling Palestinians they would be safer in the south, Israel has continued to attack areas with a high civilian presence like Khan Younis and Rafah.The Rafah crossing has opened to allow some aid in, but the number of trucks is nowhere near what is needed. Gaza needs at least 100 aid trucks every day. Fuel has also been excluded from the list of items entering Gaza.Yeah, it‚Äôs obviously just on Palestinians now/s
100k people blocking the traffic and preventing ambulances from coming through...
I heard IDF/Gaza saw this and instantly decided they're going to stop all military actions towards each other /s
So sad to see an American embassy attacked like this
The optics around the World, are telling a different story, unfortunately. It seems like the more Israel bombs Gaza and pictures and videos appear of the destructions and lives taken , the more we ( U.S.) look like war criminals for allowing this to continue.
I did, I countered it, how does Hamas killing kids make it okay for Israel to do the same thing? The basic logic you have flattens out
Multiple comments have proclaimed that Hamas has built their headquarters under the main hospital and they are operating inside mosques and schools. Yet no one cared to fact-check or provide evidence to backup their claims.. PLEASE SHOW ME YOUR EVIDENCE! All I see every single day is Palestinian children and babies severely injured and murdered! How can you support Israel knowing that?!
You have neither answered my question how u justify Hamas killing kids as a primary targetNor have u made any attempt to differentiate that kids in Gaza die because Hamas is hiding in their houses - Israel isn't killing kids "in return", they kill Hamas fighters and kids happen to be all around them.Nor have u answered what in ur opinion the best solution would be.So champ why don't u answer some questions instead if copy and paste
To avoid this becoming a \[Removed\] comment I'll say that someone sure is winning social media war.
Alternative plan: Quietly remove their chair from the meeting room, act surprised when they show up. Pretend they never had veto rights.
I dont get these fucks. Most of them will use the argument ‚Äúbut we got Arabs in Israel‚Äù in arguments but then say shit like this lol.
Letting children live is not letting the terrorists live. Non combatants should not be targed plain and simple
So because a terrorist organization killed kids it makes it okay to kill kids in return? Yeah make that make sense champ
How does Hamas justify Killing the kids point blank? - that's the more pressing question u are not asking because for Hamas children were a primary target.Fir Israel children are nit the primary target, they are as sad as it is collateral damage because Hamas hides in houses and there is not much besides roof knocking, mass phone calls what Israel can do about it.What is the alternative in ur opinion? Let terrorist win?
No they just want all the jews dead as per usual..

&gt;Also don‚Äôt seem the condemnation of Hamas for war crimes of hiding weapons a rockets in civilian sites, but god forbid anyone mentions that.This is bad faith arguing. I don't see Israel saying their priority is saving the hostages. Instead they bombed them with no real regard to their safety.
It‚Äôs a Saturday.. ?
Israel allowed humaitarian support through southern Gaza. Hamas shoots and kill people that try to reach to the south to get more propaganda and have more legitimacy. Everything is in the south, Hamas just denies access. Its the Palestinians problem now, not ours.
TIL 100,000 people in London don't know what "genocide " is
But do you condemn Israel for the atrocities they‚Äôve been committing?
He's dead aint he
Dont forget the space lasers /s
Imagine getting downvoted for literally just copy/pasting a news article. Israel shills are really coping hard this time around. Keep it up.
But do condemn Israel???
My autistic brain read UNSC as the other cooler one with MAC guns at first
Alternate plan: Recognize Ukraine as the successor to USSR. They are the successor to Kievan Rus, so they get Muscovy's seat.
Israel‚Äôs forced displacement of Gazans from North to South Gaza in the midst of a siege that leaves them without food, water, electricity or shelter is in fact deliberate infliction on the group conditions calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole or in part. So
Green Bay... probably on his way back from the bar, stuffed with cheese curds.
World News is clearly heavily brigaded with Israeli propaganda and this is brigaded by Qatarian money and faux-leftists. It sucks.
Agreed.  I have been to every invasion beach and this is definitely Utah.

Okay, if you're going to be that breathtakingly stupid and accuse everyone you disagree with it being part of a bot farm, why wouldn't  that logic apply to the flood of posts like this one that clearly violated the rules and flagrantly get away with it?
The 1st ammendment doesn't allow you to slap police.
so sad yet so true. As a Jew I'm disgusted by what's happening worldwide right now
Yup. But then again we are on a subreddit where people can sit back and watch countless videos of human beings being obliterated from the face of the earth in numerous conflicts as a form of entertainment, whilst probably never having to endure anything similar in their own lives. It's very dystopian.
How does that justify the deaths of babies?
Good old **Dark Angel**, I miss that series. Now, life imitating art.
Regardless of what you‚Äôre protesting or what country you‚Äôre doing it in, getting violent with police typically doesn‚Äôt end well.
It's a result of starting a war and then being in the receiving end.Ask Hamas what justifies going over the border, killing 1400 civilians and starting a war without the propper preparations for their own civiliansYes, Hamas also has responsibilities, food water gasoline bunkers, evacuation routes etc ....  - that's their job before they drag their ppl into that shit!What does/did Hamas do protect "it's own civilians" before and after starting the war? - and don't tell me they didn't know what would happen, please they are professional terrorist who attack Israel for decades, they knew what would happen.I tell u what they did:NOTHINGWhy? - because they don't care! The more dead children the better it is for them on TikTok etc, best PR they can get!Km not saying everything Israel does is good, but u ppl never ask what is the responsibility of Hamas or the Palestinians - they did get billions and billions and they spend it on is rocket and weapons instead of education and useful stuff - but yeah it's always Israel fault, always and forever and Hamas/Palestine/Arabs have zero responsibility
you could also just chant ‚Äúlife to america‚Äù
Are they demanding the immediate release of hostages and an end to the rockets being fired out of Gaza?
Wait.. When did Palestine exist?
Because they only consume censored media. No one is watching ‚Äúal jazeera‚Äù which is actively showing what is happening minute by minute. Anyone else feel free to add
Hahaha! Damn Baristas always supporting terror.       I‚Äôm dying right now. Thank you.
Condemn Hamas condemn Hamas condemn Hamas condemn hamas
And then also bomb the area which they told you to flee to :/
That may indeed be fact, but the chances of the recording being legit is doubtful. .what a horrible mess of a situation it all is. . Two of the most vile groups stoking the fires of hate,on one side you have Muslim extremists who are stone cold savages and on the other side you have ultra othodox jews who show so much passion in hate and very much work off a mob mentality . .  caught in the middle are the innocents.

Well, have you forgotten the Versailles treaty? Occupying France was basically just revenge.
I ordered Starbucks today but the barista didn't condemn Hamas so I left
Uhhhh, apparently, you hate all amendments? Do you hate the 14th one also?Edit: your from UK, so let me ask, can you openly protest the monarchy? Apparently not, we can in US.https://www.cnn.com/2023/05/06/uk/king-charles-anti-monarchy-protest-arrests-ckc-gbr-intl/index.html
THE PANAVIA TORNADO BOIS ARRIVED ASWELL
Or demanding the hostages are released.
Yes, entrance‚Äôs and weapons/ammo storage. With all reason this is their main target when striking the buildings as they are calling for evacuation before hand. So killing people can‚Äôt be their main target with the attacks. These air strikes have been preparing the battlefield. There cutting off know entrances and depots. The tunnels are Hamas‚Äôs strongest asset to withstand the Israeli forces. There going to want to limit their access to this tunnels. This has always been a nightmare scenario for a large uniformed force fighting smaller insurgent style forces. Just look at Vietnam.
This, honestly, seems fine. But I‚Äôm an American.
And that massive terror attack was inspired by decades of occupation. Israel created Hamas.
Were they blowing up a harkonen spice crawler there?
When didn't Israel have command and control of its own military, and how do you explain why they haven't wiped out any Arab state since their founding?  Israel exercises restraint and you ignore it, while Arab states can openly call for their destruction?
This guy doesn‚Äôt Cop
Someone did this near me and died
Chill bro. He said 1st amendment.
&gt;Shouting slogans advocating the destruction of the Israeli state and deaths of Jewish people. Not so much.A distinction many refuse to even hear about.
‚Äúgenocide‚Äù lmao
Or any records of a 1 year old killing a Jew? I can‚Äôt seem to find any
Baby terrorists? Do you have any pictures of babies marching into Israel with machine guns? That‚Äôs a new one
Explain it to me
How does any of that justify the deaths of 5,000 innocent women and children?
Ya can't cease fire with terrorists they will keep shooting rockets at isreal. hamas don't have any peace, only killing jews
1 - Hamas/Gaza had the number of dead civilians inflated by 3-10 fold in previous conflicts - so any number from Gaza right now is "doubtful" at best2If Israel wanted to kill everyone off they would be done in less than a week, maybe even less than 3 days - so if that's what Israel wanted they are doing a really poor job.What Is Hamas doing for it's civilians?Let them evacuate - noBomb shelters in quantity for everyone - noLet civilians hide inside the tunnels - noMoving there base if operations outside of houses - noWhat responsibility has Hamas??? Has it any in your thoughts?Your playing the old song of "the one with the greater loss of live is the poor guy and is always in the right" - RIGHT AND WRONG IS NOT DETERMINED BY THE NUMBER IF DEATHS IR THE MOST SUFFERING - by that logic Hitler was the good guy as more Germans died than allied soldiers, and we all know Hitler started WW2 and he was the bad guyLook at the history, Jews, christians and Muslims have lived there everyone has "a right for peace and a state" - the Jews agreed to multiple 2 state solutions and we're always attacked by the Arab, the latter already got the most land (Syrai, Jordan), there are plenty of Arab states to pick which were once part of "Palestine, formerly known as Judea" and yet, besides all that land which went to the Arabs AND Israel agreeing to multiple 2 states solution they still want to annihilate Israel FROM DAY ONE - why?So tell me, who can't get there mouth full enough?palestine/gaza has gotten billions and billions of money, they could have built houses for everyone, education, solar, industry, tourism - and what did they do with that billions? - rockets, guns and suicide bombingsCongratulations üëè!!Why does everyone always criticise ONLY Israel without looking what the ppl of Gaza/Palestine actually did for themselves and with the money they did get from us?Moral question:Why don't support Hamas even though their sharia state represents NOTHING of the values you have and benefit in every day life?
Seriously don‚Äôt know why people keep cotingn the UN. It‚Äôs a f**king joke at this point. They can‚Äôt even get a declaration passed condemning the attack from Hamas.
Lmfao source? I just googled this and the only thing people are saying is it was confirmed by the Gaza health ministry. Which is ran by terrorist. Your right some people like you really are in fairyland.
Was this a Darwin Award winner?
That yes-yes is very sus. You don‚Äôt happen to have any warpstone, do you?
I going to say atleast 5 people are there
Yup, people are degrading the defenitions of words now. Anything that doesn't align with one's worlds perception is fascism, when civilians die because this is what happens in every war its genocide and so on....
It‚Äôs been quite boring for a while. Stupid cese fire this and that. The world is about to get way more interesting.
Reddit* we will both be B worded soon I'm sure.
Me to, I‚Äôve been studying this conflict for quite so time. I‚Äôm so happy things are kicking off.
We don‚Äôt know the exact numbers, but it is obvious that  there is a lot. Just look at the utter devastation. It doesn‚Äôt take a rocket scientist to conclude the numbers of innocents killed is staggering just based on the images and videos.
It‚Äôs not only hamas. Multiple organizations have given death count estimates. Hamas is saying way more has been killed. In Iran there is propaganda that the hospital killed 1500.
Watched since day one
**[REMOVED]**
It's hamas numbers, not a valid source, un ain't no better
Yes it‚Äôs probably even more. Have you seen the footage?
never. they gonna hire bots to fight for them we can fight back on our own.
So they say
Compare them. Israel lost 1400 5,000 Palestinians have been killed
Not stupid. You're the one who looks stupid right now
Lean back right hand on the pinewood
Israel cant hear them with all the sound of the bombs in both directions.
The start of the landings were indeed planned for high tide so most of the beach obstacles would be underwater and out of the way, and there'd be a shorter section of beach to traverse. As the morning went on naturally the tide went out.
Joke's on them I won't stop and neither should you.
We‚Äôre the saviours! Death to Jews! We want peace! Death to Jews! Save Palestine! Up Hamas! I‚Äôve heard both shit from the same sides. I‚Äôve seen Hamas flags at Save Palestine rallies. Your comment is nonsense and pushing a dangerous rhetoric that because certain extremists of a group support something, the rest of the group must also. Many Jewish people love Muslims and the people in Gaza. Just like many Muslim people love Jewish people. The blatant hatred for Jewish people without considering the same action being taken by extremists from the ‚Äòother side‚Äô gets old fast.
Karens when they realize 90% of those in the military are like 18-28 year old enlisted who have ample fucking around time: üò±
Really? So all the videos of innocent unarmed people getting shot In The street are fake? They wore GoPros while doing many worse things as well. Idc where you live. I‚Äôm glad you posted on Reddit that you‚Äôve been helping fund terrorist that makes you a terrorist by extension. And I hope what ever governing body you live under or mussad/CIA track your ass down. And punish you like the terrorist you are. You all deserve to be put down fast and hard.

Nobody? Have you seen the protests lately in Europe? They literally have ISIS flags and openly support hamas and want to exterminate Israel.
I‚Äôd compare the numbers of dead babies and then maybe see how stupid you sound
5,000 civilians have died in 2 weeks. And you‚Äôre saying Israel is doing everything know it‚Äôs power? Conservatives like you will defend Israel no matter what. Pathetic
Yeah this is the real problem with terror organizations, this is exactly what America dealt with in its war on terror. Eliminating Hamas entirely will be impossible since its ideals.  The best we can hope. Is they hinder any ability they have to carry out attacks on such a large scale.
It‚Äôs the only thing people can do. The Governments threw their unconditional support to Israel the day it started again, and they all knew Israel would respond like this. Didn‚Äôt care.

I mean it‚Äôs her document that babies were found without heads. That is the definition of beheading. Wether they took a kite and did it or blew it off I‚Äôm with an ak are we really splitting hairs about this?
Propaganda and bloodlust don‚Äôt spread themselves.
no not at all. it‚Äôs auto mod removing comments. BOT comments by zionists.
Yes because Hamas will never accept a solution to Palestinian freedom that doesn't include the total removal of the Israeli people and state.
How can he slap?
Where is the right place?
Hmm, I wonder if any of those thousands of people protested when hamas attacked and took hostages?
What is? Those look like real people.
But do you condemn Hamas?
Fully agree man i couldn‚Äôt do it, they‚Äôre always gonna be 10x the man I‚Äôd ever be in my entire life. Unfortunately not everyone made it off the beaches on that day but their impact on history and the world we live in today is forever gonna be remembered. Always remember the men of D-Day.
If it‚Äôs released by the IDF it‚Äôs fake though.\s Lol
Won‚Äôt matter. The West has given Israel the green light to do whatever they want.
Since when are wages more important than stopping kids being killed?Regardless, you can form that protest if you want.

Like this issue, the Israeli-Hamas issue, isn't complex at all...   Like who thinks Israel will listen to these protesting people, lol.
But Palestinian children are taught that Israel has no right to exist, and all Jews are legitimate targets.I don't hate Palestinians. I despise religious fundamentalists who engage in brutal, violent terror. Hamas will never bring peace and prosperity to Palestine.

Headquarters is under a hospitalThe stack rocket in tunnels below houses where people live, or in the basementThey don't let the civilians evacuateThey don't offer shelter for civilians in their tunnelsThey fire their rockets in dense populated ares, on roof of schools kindergarten and playgrounds - knowingly that Israel might retaliate at that exact spotFir Hamas OR Team dead civilians sell extremely good in the world= "look how evil Israel is"On the contrary Israel does the following to avoid civilians casualties as much as possible:Mass calling per phoneRoof knockingAnd flyers from planesHamas cares shut about their ppl as u can see

Someone dump saying it is a proofI have a proof on the other handYou can find the reporter, the kids name and all in UNRWA Gaza organization So shut the f*** up
Yeah with a camera to specifically target hamas people
Dude, this has been verified for a long time, they were blocking the roads as soon as Israel made their announcement about evacuations. Hamas themselves have publicly made statements about blocking the roads.Israel knew this was going to happen and they don't give a shit, they'll bomb everybody and then call everyone Hamas afterwards.
This is Walt Disney fantaisies. a certain country told the rest of the world they were weapons of mass destruction in Irak. This certain country funded hamas with another one, a blue one, and this happens. Only kids and low iq don‚Äôt get this. Anyway apparently it‚Äôs time to finish the job and put some dirt on some hands.
Just another day of Hebrew-speaking Europeans on Arab land doing what they do
Why /S?  Airliners use this...
That‚Äôs where the hostages are most likely being held. This was corroborated by the hostages released by Hamas recently. Though, considering the political history between the Kibbutzim and Likud, I‚Äôm not sure the Israeli government really gives a fuck if they massacre their own citizens with Sarin.
And the children of today will be the terrorists of tomorrow . Wonder why.
Yeah all over the place people are saying that US SFOD-D were on the ground and involved in the incursion, stating that *over 30+ soldiers were killed." While sharing videos from other conflicts as their "proof."

[removed] Lol this is fun
maybe start by doing a ground offensive door to door like the US did in israel, and not flatten an entire city and dispossess millions. ‚Ä¶ but more seriously, start by being willing to talk. israel has always had asymmetrical power in these interactions, and therefore ‚Äúnegotiates‚Äù like a bully. you‚Äôve got to get both sides to operate and negotiate in good faith
So how do you get it to stop? Hamas just started an atrocious act against Israel which will now make younger Israelis hate the Palestinians and since Israel retaliated (rightfully so) now Palestinian children will continue the hate on their side. How do you get it to stop? You can‚Äôt in my opinion. What options do they have? The only one I see is to take out the aggressor and anyone that sides with them.
F-16s are so dope. The scoop is the sexiest intake of all airplanes.

Weird how the call for genocide and a religious extremism can be violent. Such a shocker
Pretty poor description of Nazi strategy for deterring resistance. It was official policy to murder whole towns and large portions of cities anytime resistance popped up in Eastern Europe, including Poland.There wasn‚Äôt really any claim that it was necessary. It was just viewed as an effective way to keep control over the areas and the Nazis viewed these people as subhuman.They did not have the same policy in France and the rest of Western Europe.
Willy became very questionable to me when he had a "wagner" source on his podcast who was talking about the goings on in Bakhmut before Russia took it. This guest claimed Wagner had Chinese people from DJI on the ground with them working on the drones. Hiiiiiighly sus.By all means listen, just listen with a very critical ear.
please. open your eyes. when israelis are posting videos like this, it‚Äôs clear that neither side isn‚Äôt full of bullshit. https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnewsvideo/s/c5qdOASO2qpalestine continues to birth generations of terrorists who hate israelis for terrorising, bombing and killing their families. the settlements. the violence. the inhumane treatment and policing of those in the west bank where you can be shot just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.similarly israelis have been bainwashed to think of palestinians as sub human, to be treated as scum. they speak of and treat palestinians the way germany treated the jews. it‚Äôs batshit insane how much they‚Äôve become what they despise. both sides of the same coin. both locked in violence until someone can start a real discussion.
That issue is too complex. Watch your [Entertainment Streaming Service] and enjoy your [Water-laced Sugar Beverage] and pray these issues won‚Äôt interrupt your status quo. Because if they eat away at it slowly you won‚Äôt even notice.
Hamas is a lot more evil than ISIS ever was.

I think that was Israel,  not the City of Westminster. Anyhoo, don't give the Home Secretary more barmy ideas please.
To be fair, overclaiming has been an issue for militaries for the last hundred or so years at least. It‚Äôs why during the Second World War, nobody‚Äôs airmen claimed numbers of destroyed aircraft or ship were right and why the orders to count bodies were issued in the Vietnam War.
Definitely a Public Freakout, also misguided rage at a target that is Arabic owned  and does not support Israel.

why do i see so much black hot instead of white hot?
The headquarters are under the main hospital. They are blocking civilians from escaping war zone. They put their equipment in mosques and schools. They are pretty much dirt bags. ... I hope they are destroyed...they are evil!
You have to reach the tunnel first for that, and they don't penetrate the ground super deep, at least not with those standard bombs with a JDAM kit, it would probably need bunker busters.As far as I know it penetrates like 80cm of concrete? Not sure, but under those circumstances it's definitely not difficult to build a bunker that can withstand it. 2 meters of concrete or just digging really deep would do the trick.But I doubt many civilians are allowed there, so they get killed while hamas is fine with their tunnels, bunkers and their giant pile of supplies and ammunition.I seriously don't know how Israel is supposed to eliminate Hamas, the whole thing is a giant cluster fuck and Hamas had the advantage because they had time to plan.
That looked like a pretty solid punch, not a "slap".
Is this a small scale raid or has the full on invasion started?
You're a joke
Are they even hitting the caves? Are there any reliable facts on this topic?The tunnels are build to withstand bombings, if the IDF is only hitting the civilian houses on top while hamas chills deep in the ground, completely unharmed, then that's basically genocide in the making. You can't drop thousands of bombs, kill thousands of innocent women and children while they aren't even killing many fighters. And when people in Israel shout death to all Arabs while watching them get bombed then this all sounds a lot like genocide and war crimes.
Those numbers are verified by the WHO lmao some people are so deep in their fairy world

Most of the world is against what Israel is doing, this place is just an echo chamber that reinforces their own beliefs. You can try and believe it's just factual all you want but that doesn't change reality.  Also hilariously my simple point about how this is an echo chamber that downvotes opinions the hivemind doesn't agree with...got downvoted.

thats silly too, cause if they lost to the US...they still lost.
Yuck ü§Æ get a job
Yup. It has nothing to do with religion.There are Palestinian Christians, Catholics, Hindus, and probably Palestinian Jews. But it's just easier for western countries to believe that all Palestinians are Muslim, all Muslims are bad, and they should all be exterminated. Its easier to see them as a monolith because nobody wants to admit or do research as to what is actually happening. Racism is just easier. It's never been about religion. It's about ethnic cleansing, colonization, imperialism, AND MOST IMPORTANTLY: Money $$$$
Apparently Mcdonald's in Turkey got bought out by an Austrian-based, Qatari-owned company called Boheme Investment last year. Mcdonald's in Israel is owned by an Israeli Businessman. The anger is because it gave out tens of thousands of free meals to soldiers, hospitals, rescue forces, police, and even normal citizens after Oct 7. A lot have viewed this as Mcdonald's as a whole supporting the IDF.
Tell that to all the victims of ISIS, so what? They're not the same, they are not even similar enough to make those comparisons.Two things can be bad with one being a lot worse, what's so hard to understand about that? There's a reason why only one country fights Hamas, while ISIS was basically fought by half the fucking world.
lmaoo, the bots are increasing and the money going out to pay people to argue against palestine is also increasing.
can you provide a source for that?
Problem with sealing them off is the hostages are probably down there too !
The drone footage was what did it for me, it's not new tech but just seeing literal modern warfare was so crazy I laughed I felt bad sitting in my suburb in the Midwest.
If that upsets you, you should learn about all of the innocent Palestinians who were slaughtered over a time frame of *75 fucking years* You're looking at one event. You're not even considering what has happened throughout history that could have led to this moment, and how the western nations are all guilty of enabling the extermination of the Palestinian people.I'm not going to sit here and justify terrorism, but if you think bombing innocent Palestinians is the answer to ending terrorism... **whispers** it's actually going to make terrorism even worse...
Except in this case they're not the same. Naming some gangs in the US is neither relevant nor a good comparison.
The irony of Israelis gassing their enemies will be milked to the end of humanity.
No, not really. Nobody ever defended ISIS dude, it's obviously and objectively different.
So then I guess hamas should stop using those institutions as bases for their training and bunkers for their government?
no what started the conflict was england thinking they had the right to put an entire ethnic/religious group in an area that wasn‚Äôt theirs while also murdering the people who lived there originally.
Hamas places rockets and munitions in places like mosques, by hospitals. They also told civilians to stay in northern Gaza trying to make them martyrs
Liquid nitrogen on the other hand‚Ä¶
 Should countless lives be sacrificed &amp;#x200B;isn't that "sacrifice" already being conducted with numerous civilan casulties on palestinian side ?
It's probably the first shot after being cleaned,  in the US the breech for those is usually cleaned in diesel, and diesel works amazing for removing carbon.

It still doesn't answer my question.

thank u aaaaaaaaa &lt;3i came up with him cause i had the capital-Z in my username since i made the account and i couldn't drop it :c so i decided "fuck it ima draw a cute tank fren to feel better"
playing palestinian national anthem on Isreali TV is funny
Which should be obvious, the more people see Israelis killing Palestinians the less supportive they will be of the whole operation.In Ukraine it's the opposite, the more people see the more support they get, that's why they can just upload so much.So far people are/were still shocked by 7/10 so they support Israel, but it got noticeably less every week this goes on. The first couple of non Arab countries are starting to critize Israel's actions, you see people protesting and shit, when it happened it was completely different.So yeah, Israel knows the more footage gets out the more people start to critize it and will ask for peace (which Israel really doesn't want, they need people to be angry), so they don't let people release their footage.Also you see so little ground footage, most is filmed from far away which is why you don't see the suffering in the affected area.
The tunnels are made out of concrete themselves and are resistant to groundwater. Hamas learned from North-Korea. In fact, North-Korean engineers have, supposedly, engineered and partly build the Hamas tunnels.
Why is a non-freakout video even up?
Not a freakout.
They will all be ignored.  The govt knows that eventually, everyone gets tired and hungry and goes home.
Rolling barage, well trained NCO, and counter machinegun artillery fire time?
I'm guessing that Hamas may have brainstormed these possibilities when they built them, although, maybe not, and they could easily be smoked out.
They hide with them using them. Their main base is under the hospital, so they know isreal won't bomb it, and before isreal dropped a bomb, they said Palestinian hamas would show dead baby's to gain sympathy from the public but it's ok if Jewish baby's die just not Palestinians makes me sick.
&gt;"Fuck this stone wall in particular!"
Those Hamas thugs are a tad slow. If they *really* wanted to rescue/spare the stone thrower, they should've clambered up to bring him down a minute or two earlier. But, of course, getting him shot was the whole point, wasn't it? Cameras *conveniently* there to capture it all.Edit: typo
What does genocide mean these days ?
I'm honestly surprised deep tunnels aren't already flooded given they are so close to the sea.  What kind of bedrock is under Palestine?
What's up with all the comments getting deleted?
He just started the Go Pro, Go Fund me campaign. Currently, he's on the front lines drawing pictures of the action, like those court artists when cameras are not allowed.
You mean the lady in the glasses clapping and handing out candy in the street?  She can find sympathy between shit and syphilis as far as I'm concerned.
According to the experts... which you can listen to here: [What can IDF do about Hamas tunnels](https://open.spotify.com/episode/3B8Z6f5fU9j0JYF0sv4bsF?si=yONzHU_-R9qE7MRPo8CxbQ). Is that indeed pump seawater into the entrances of the tunnels, or likewise poor concrete into entrances.Both have its up and down sides:Concrete: expensive and nearly impossible if entrances are deep into Gaza territory. Also only blocks the entrances itself since they cannot transfer a lot of concrete due to its weight and logistic issues of concrete trucks. But concrete ensures a full closed entrance. Seawater: logistically possible and not expensive. But doesn't create permanent damage. Advantage is that the tunnels may be connected to a very large degree and without drains. Thus flushing them out may be a possibility. But who knows how much water is required.
Drunk probably.
Two things can be very bad, with one being significantly worse still
&gt;The Muslim world will do right?well, who knows?
**REMOVED**
Normal militarys build base away from civilians to minimize casualties. Hamas is using the population as a means of deterance. That is the reason on a shield. To deter damages.
Well they weren't kind enough to let me know that if they did lol
Think about it. Human shield. Shields block things. No shield can block a JDAM, so instead HAMAS stations their forces inside civilians areas, knowing that the IDF will limit strikes on innocent people.They‚Äôre using people as live shields.
Cause they build main base under hospitals an schools. In tunnels. That's the literal definition of human sheild. It doesn't mean they are strapping civs to there chest.
It‚Äôs almost like the destruction of Israel and death of Jewish people is what started the conflict in the first place
Since gas like propane is heavy, you could literally pour it in and just wait could you not?  Then just throw a match in?Just pour gallons and gallons of it in. My imagination is running wild lol
Aren‚Äôt those fire extinguishers pretty dangerous too?  Toxic?  Can‚Äôt remember what‚Äôs in them, but I do remember from back in the day that you really didn‚Äôt want to be too close to them when they‚Äôre activated.
Seems like, the ocean is right there. Couldn‚Äôt be too hard to dig a trench over to an entrance and wait, right?
Oh I didn't realize Netanyahu prepared a Marshall plan for Gaza with open borders and billions of aid so they can build an economy.It's odd if you think about it, those were the literal Nazi's and we converted them by being kind and generous after their defeat. Yeah I'm sure Israel will have the same foresight and wisdom, lol.
Thermobaric explosives will fix those tunnels up real nice.  The pressure in a confined space turns everyone into ketchup.
[removed]When you tear out a man's tongue, you are not proving him a liar, you're only telling the world that you fear what he might say.‚Äù ‚Äï George R.R. Martin
THey should reach out to the Hamas guys who they tend to cheer on. See if they will lend a hand to evacuate them out of those areas. Oh wait, Hamas setup blockades on roads to make sure civilians don‚Äôt leave
 20 days ago you were cheering the suspension of electricity, fuel, and goods to Gaza. Oh well. Reddit points.
[removed]Does not fit the pre existing agenda.  You will all comply, you have no choice.
Propane or natural gas would be quick; run a line and release it into the tunnel being cleared. Using a remote ignition system it would, without discrimination, kill any unfortunate people in the area of the explosion, that and possibly destroy the tunnel.
 The restaurant is probably owned by a turkish franchiser. The building and glass windows might be owned by a rental company. Then there's the whole insurance company aspect. In any event, this probably won't cost McDonalds (the corporation) a single penny. If anything, it's free pity points.
Russian is not under attack, and is so big it doesn't care to be put under sanctions, something Israel can't afford and Israel is tiny. If Israel had Russia's land, by now it would have been the most powerful and advanced country in the world.
‚ÄúI know what‚Äôs best for the world‚Äù said the egotist. Man‚Äôs unyielding need to fix the world is usually his veil for wanting to control it.

that was a very enjoyable video.
No internet. No way of knowing what's going on. Seems ripe for the IDF to just kill anyone and anything now. God help Gazan civilians. Nobody on earth is going to come to their rescue.
Everyone else: being pro Palestinian and supporting Hamas are two entirely separate things.Some random Malaysian MFERS:
Poring concrete or flooding them out with water is the only solution according to some experts I listed to on a podcast.
Why are you trying to make this an antisemitic thing?

You are correct
Considering the current escalation is a direct result of one of the most massive terror attacks in our lifetime I would say acknowledging that is kind of necessary for any sort of sane conversation

yea, because those were not combat footage, those were terror footage. killing civilians has nothing to do with combat footage, only with murder.
All these protests to support Palestine, but no one rushing to join Hamas. Just protesting the latest thing

[This is the Hamas version.](https://www.israelnationalnews.com/news/379151)
That‚Äôs wild dude
All of those Israeli talking points are moronic.  "Like, didn't 99% of Russians vote for Putin? So fuck all Russians?? OMG!!"  More frowns for humanity.
Israel does not allow soldiers to independently release any kind of footage shot during military operations. OPSEC is important.
People need to march like this for better wages and end to corporate corruption/greed.
For the sake of conversation, I don't think throwing ordinance around is going to solve the tunnel issue. I mean, aside from straight up chemical warfare or just leveling the city to block entry and exit. Tunnels have been the bane of conventional armies for centuries. I'm not going to pretend like I know the best solution or even have any weight in this fight at all. But as an empathetic bleeding heart, I can't help but feel saddened by the level of destruction. That being said, religious ideologies have been fighting for this same strip of land for thousands of years. And it hardly came as any surprise. I was more surprised that Israel seemed to be caught so off guard.
That is insane if true. To survive that for one, and to move on a second chance of life to this. Totally wild.
Ikr? Where are the cops? I swear if I threw a gum wrapper out the window they'd come out of no where and fine me.
You mean close quarter execution of civilians, dogs, children? Yeah that stuff is banned here. Falls under promoting terrorism. WHICH IS A BAD THING.

A lot of the explosions are secondary explosions in this video. The bombs Israel drops don't explode upward that way either on their own.

as a result of the genocide population estimates within gaza have reduced from 2.2 million to 2.8 million.
According to internet edge lords the IDF forces were easily eliminated by Hamas militants just right after the IDF troops finished committing a genocide.
He was actually a real soldier before brain cancer forced him to quit.
Lmao. It hasn‚Äôt been and where did you get those ridiculous numbers ?! 3000 children killed ? Over 7000 is wrong too.
No
Hamas is a known terrorist organization. You don't need to hear people condemn Al-Qaeda or ISIS every time they do something bad. It's a given.
Lmao, care to explain then or are you just evading and coping at this point. Did you like the link I‚Äôve provided bro?
Idk man, the whole denazification thing worked out well in Germany after they were bombed to shit, invaded, and installed with new governments. Gaza is much smaller too so it won't be as difficult to achieve
No that‚Äôs not what it means actually

And we see the same in Israel goes both ways, not just the Palestinians are suffering, so stop being one-sided

To all the armchair warriors calling to stop the "genocide", how do you propose the hamas tunnels are eliminated? Should countless lives be sacrificed trying to clear the 5+ miles of them? If you think that is a feasible option you are simply ignorant
 Damn, I can't imagine him living
What are you even talking about?? That‚Äôs a literal definition of genocide, I can grab the google link if you need? Israel is committing a genocide
Where‚Äôs any proof of any of that? Regardless, if that really validates murdering children and hospital patients, I have no more words to say to you. Do you know who else killed children in civilians off of the basis they might be hiding counterinsurgents? :/ history repeats itself
If you kill them all there will be no one left to hold a grudge sounds like a solution to me!
Anyone know why the cannon of the m109 caught fire for a second?
I do not condone bombing. But when you hit someone randomly. Do not be shock if they knock you out so they can assess the situation, an take proper course of action after. Do not strike people.
Yeah that already happened they are all terrorists didn't you see the way they cheered as babies were being beheaded the IDAF ended their cheering with JDAMS but they were pretty happy till they started getting bombed back
Let's be realistic. People who participate in street protests, whatever the cause, are not there for balanced POVs. They have their slogans and their bias (particularly on this conflict). That is to be expected.
According to the Zionist Isreali Terrorist Army... IDF..every Palestinian IA a Terrorist...that's why... and their Torah allows them to commit Genocide of the Palestinians because they are Animals
NCD probably has Mossad operatives, ◊©÷∏◊Å◊ú◊ï÷π◊ù guys and gals!!!  Stay safe and fight hard, lots of the world still believes in you!
THEY DO thats why i keep saying there are no civilians in gaza because most of them are hamas supporters that cooperate with hamas
Wartime material. Your a civilian. There is evidence. There main caches of ammo and storage is under civilian infrastructure. Ie. Schools hospitals as well as residential buildings. I mean. Most militarys build there bases away from civilians. Just saying.

Who‚Äôs we?
Wrong. Whoever is left in northern gaza has made his choice. Israel has to purge every last supporter of hamas. And western countries should look what they can do to help in that undertaking.
Nice lies OP
Yeah, they deleted the video where hamas threw grenades into a bomb shelter
There was never a Palestine to begin with. In all actuality they never had a ‚Äúhome‚Äù to begin with. Both groups were promised lands in that region in which ultimately both groups had received. It was the Palestinians who believed they got the raw end of the deal which angered them even tho they had no agreement with Israel or the Jews. Israel has attempted to be diplomatic with them, for example Palestinians live amongst regions of Israel and are a vital part of their country. They have even become elected officials within the Israel government. Israel has done more than I would‚Äôve to make the shitty situation work. Israel had pulled out their military in these territories to allow them to govern themselves which did nothing more than allow a vacuum of terrorists to occupy these territories that were allocated to them. Can you name a time Israel had fired missiles into Gaza or the Westbank without being provoked? Can you name a time when Israel went into their territories and started massacring every Palestinian they came across? Hamas literally builds their launch sites at schools and hospitals which makes Israel contemplate whether to retaliate against them for their aggressive actions. They are scum and have no business being in a world for the most part that is civilized.
They must have the Russians working for them.  According to the Russians, they knocked out 25 Abrams tanks and 8 F16s in Ukraine.  Just in the last 24 hours.
Now birds (Government vigilance drones) are attack drones.
This pretty much explains why Arabs always get so sensitive whenever you point out their losses in 1948, 1967 and 1973, and keep blaming their losses on the US for helping out Israel.Everything they are told are lies. "We destroyed multiple tanks! We killed multiple people! We shot down their airforce!"Only to have Israeli tanks, planes and troops roll in days or weeks later.Were their leaders lying to them? No way. They must have been cheated once more of another victory by the American imperialist pigs.
Surely that‚Äôs a hellava lot more than 100k? Even just in that shot.
There won't be a building left in Gaza.
And the salutes of the groundcrews in these videos are always razorsharp.
When hamas uses human shields and controls the health ministry of gaza we get shit like "israel leveled a hospital killing 500" while the truth is different
 Wtf is this supposed to do? Are they just gonna be like "uh, some people in USA is saying they want us to stop shooting, we better listen then"?! ffs
Are there still houses left standing in Gaza?
‚ò†Ô∏è
Very cool. Wish we could have taken the ferry over! There is always more to do!
Yeah it‚Äôs going to do so much for the people dying. So so much.
They didn't bomb the hospital for one and all the other places, and hamas used these buildings to hide behind civilians. That's why they get hit
Your recollection, I‚Äôm sorry to say, is severely impaired. Literally everything you‚Äôve just described with the exception of suicide bombers has been done by Israelis and the Israeli government. And of course you left out the original sin of ethnically cleansing Palestinians out of their homes in ‚Äò48 and the half century long illegal occupation they‚Äôve been running. Those are some big things to slip your mind.
Which is why, if you want a real solution to this, you need the US and other western nations to step up and act as a peace mediator in good faith instead of Israel's lawyer.
First off the numbers you are citing are numbers that Hamas puts out and has an interest in inflating as part of their propaganda campaign. The number definitely isn‚Äôt 0, but those casualty numbers are to be taken with a grain of salt. Israel obviously isn‚Äôt going to openly share the precise intelligence that they have about Hamas whereabouts when they make strikes either for opsec reasons. The most clear answer I can give you though is that Hamas is firing rockets to this day at Israeli cities and civilians, and when they do Israel can use counter battery radar and strike back at the origin point of those Hamas rockets. If you know where your enemy is firing munitions at your cities from and you can respond in real time then of course they have every right to do that.
Once a civilian infrastracture is used in a military manner (weapons storage etc) it becomes a legitimate target according to the international law. Quit crying about Israel defending itself, and start reading on how Hamas uses civilian (and UN) buildings as human shields. IDF instagram is the most accesible platform. Good luck.

Yea middle east subs are the epitome of echo chambers on reddit. They are unapologetically gullible people, and judging by the region, not surprising.
Far less than Ukraine-Russia. Comms locked down in Gaza and Israel can be very tight lipped with info/footage when the situation calls for it, which it currently does.
step 1: be that guystep 2: ?step 3: die
&gt;The Israelis are so sure about the **location of the Hamas bunker**, however, not because they are trying to score propaganda points, or because it has been repeatedly mentioned in passing by Western reporters‚Äîbut **because they built it.** Back in 1983, when Israel still ruled Gaza, they built a secure underground operating room and tunnel network beneath Shifa hospital‚Äîwhich is one among several reasons why Israeli security sources are so sure that there is a main Hamas command bunker in or around the large cement basement beneath the area of Building 2 of the Hospital, which reporters are obviously prohibited from entering.lmao incredible. great source, thanks for sharing.
There is something profoundly sad about combatfootage becoming the channel of choice to glorify Israeli genocide. It‚Äôs literally just video after video of bombs falling on civilians, and no one blinks an eye, in fact encourages it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I‚Äôm fine with Israel going after Hamas for the horrors they inflicted, but let‚Äôs get real that‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre seeing is it?
you'll always be seeing half of the videos, this sub doesnt allow footage from hamas/hezbollah perspective.real shame, some truly CRAZY videos of close quarter combat and merkavas getting hit, out there, and im sure there's more to come

Man go f***ing see the videos of peopleU will see the wounds and u will see everything Hope you get the same makeup one daySo u stop bullshitting all the way
Israel should definitely do everything they can to avoid civilian casualties but Hamas needs to be wiped out. No more hanging out killing each other back and forth after this. They need to be eradicated completely. Palestine can never be free as long as they exist. Also, Israel doesn't care about this protest.
Don't cheer on death. This is incredibly sad no matter which side you're on. There are literal children down there that don't know any better.
I'd imagine a lot will become lost due to communication lockdown and Hamas losses. I doubt much from Israel or anyone connected.
You actually find this far fetched?
You mean strikes against children to get at underground tunnels?
&gt;what else can Israel itself do?As I said before, start treating Palestinians like human beings. But it may be too late now and it's obvious Israel is not going to change course under the "leadership" of that petty little gangster Netanyahu who, judging from his latest "we are the children of the light" speech seems to have gone legitimately insane.
You don't see the irony of the fact that you were fighting in the mountains of Afghanistan thousands of miles from the continental USA and you are talking shit about the people in logistics chain that facilitate that, Because they aren't professional enough?
That might be so. However, Israel is a proponent of the two state solutions while Hamas e.g. Palestine is not. If they are against it and demand the annihilation of the Israeli state, what else can Israel itself do?
Doing the lords work
Are the wings big? Do it fly good?
They enjoy seeing children die cause boom boom war is cool.
We had other places to go, unfortunately otherwise we would have done all 5. We did the museums in Caen  and st maire eglise. Then we drove east to Dunkirk and took the ferry over to Dover so we had to prioritize the american effort at the beaches.
Correct, the colonizers are indeed acting like the imperialist fascists that they are.
Ground operation, Meaning Invasion.
Tunnels have entrances, I wonder they are located?
Whatever the history, the fact remains that Israel has maneuvered itself into a pretty hopeless position, and time is running out for them to try something different for a change.
yeah, but the resulting aluminium mold would be pretty cool to look at and considered an artpiece.&amp;#x200B;so you can just sell that off to make good on the cost of the project.
Don't worry, they will make more...
Nazis? Lol üòÜ
We didn‚Äôt have artillery we had a 120mm mortar up in the mountains. We had air support. The pilots are great and they killed a lot of people.
So you guys never called in air or artillery support?
I can't imagine... 20km is close enough (too close)  for me.  You must have something like 10 seconds to get to shelter. The whole situation is incredibly sad.. were mourning and they are too but this was brought on us and we're going to have to make sure this never happens again whatever the cost. No more just accepting docket and mortar fire on our towns.
It seems like they are targeting buildings as usual.
I did all 5 last month. Spent 2 weeks there. Well worth it.
Wonder what kinda videos we‚Äôll get from this conflict. It‚Äôs already insane
Love this dude. Been following him for a while. He's been in Ukraine as well as in Turkey after the disastrous earthquake and conducted interviews with regular people as well as the military.  Hope he continues doing this and stays safe.

True, it's definitely possible to still injure or kill someone with it even if they are wearing a helmet.
Anybody who tears down posters from either side is UN- AMERICAN. Period. I am so tired and sick of all these crazy people in the USA trying to silence and censor anything they don‚Äôt like or agree with.
My ancestors shot at each other in WW2. Now we are a family. Shows me again that for the most part people just want to get along with each other and live a peaceful life with a house, car and kids. It‚Äôs always someone at the top telling them to hate each other.
Innocent people have nothing to do with any of that. It shouldn't be hard to condemn both Israel and hamas, yet some people refuse to do that, meaning they view the murder of innocent civilians as justified and that's a disgusting way to think. That's the kind if mindset that leads to atrocities
Perhaps Palestine shouldn't have unilaterally rejected the many proposals that would've solved this a long time ago. Instead they opted for violence because they demanded the entirety of Israel.
Damn I hope u keep ur head up and keep going with ur business. It's a shame we have to see and feel all this. There should be some light coming through this dark ass tunnel haha
IDF is now the IOF
Found the blue falkon
Overthrow HAMAS, return to the 1940's border established by the UN, get both Israel and a democratically elected Palestine to agree to the borders.  &amp;#x200B;...Profit?
You suffer from cognitive dissonance: first it was never about Hamas and the next sentence said it‚Äôs always been about Hamas.  And I‚Äôm guessing you have counted the bodies yourself and you‚Äôre expert in differentiating between the civilians and the Hamas fucktards.
You can't rule out the possiblity that it was a Hamas crow accidentally misfiring

Your equivalence is leaning incredibly hard on the "if" qualifiers in your statements. There are clear, significant, differences in ideology, scope of ambitions, brutality, etc. And they're enemies. The conflation of the two is based more on Israeli propaganda goals than reality; that it's just now being pushed as a narrative is not a coincidence.&gt; Saying there‚Äôs no distinction between Hamas and the Islamic State is ‚Äúan effective tactic to paint it ‚Äî and all Gazans, given many Israeli leaders‚Äô generalizing language ‚Äî as inhuman, irredeemably evil and therefore legitimate targets for savagery in reprisal,‚Äù...&gt;&gt; You can‚Äôt just say, ‚ÄòISIS slaughtered people and so did Hamas, so they‚Äôre the same.‚Äô That‚Äôs very superficial.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2023/10/25/hamas-isis-islamic-state-israel-terrorism-analogy/
Yea it's rough. I started a profitable business but am still technichally homeless lol. Truth is a lot of these countries like Russia, Iran abd China are working very hard to make our prices much harder. They want us to feel the financial struggle. If we did not have the global influence with our millitary they would economically trample us. We made a mistake when our millitary industrial complex become our main source of production. But it is here now. Cant throw it away. Gotta make the best of it. Wish you the best my man. Remember we are all on the same team. Be kind to your neighbors and we'll be ok over here anyway lol
Alright sure -We live in a system that is ever perfecting its efficiency of systemic enslavement of the common man for a select few of rich and powerful. Currently the profits of our labour are on full display for the world to ignore whilst it‚Äôs blown or burned away.
Yeah you gotta wonder why Israel can't seem to understand that treating the Palestinians a bit more humanely would, in the long run, save them a lot of effort and money. This has been going on for 70 years now and they're back on square one. 25 years of Netanyahu has been an absolute disaster for Israel.
Lol its fun join the club!
A Netflix serial where you can almost watch the little children die.
God speed IDF
Right? How dare you use lead?! Don't you know that lead is radioactive and has a half life of 1.73x10\^7 years!?! Nuclear attack!
Hamas is alive and strong in the WB. They are leading the violence against Israelis, rallies, de-facto controlling cities in the north of the region where the PA is afraid of going in, controlling students unions and most of all they control and manipulate the opinions of the people on the streets with the help of Iran regime. Abu Mazen (Fatah) is probably losing next election as they lost in Gaza, that's why there was no election for PLO for years and why he is arresting any Hamas leader in the WB he can put his hands on.
I remember the Occupy protests that happened a year after I graduated high school. Hundreds of thousands of younger people gathered in large cities to protest corruption by big banks and their collaboration with the government after the 08 crisis. After the occupy protests concluded, major banks were disbanded and large corporations were forced to split up like the monopolies of the early 1900s. The economy rebounded and everyone lived happily ever after.Protests work guys. I think the Israeli government will stop doing what they're doing and everyone in the middle east will come together and hold hands and sing a song of peace. I'm sure that America will disband its alliance with Israel because so many people on Tiktok and Reddit put a Palestinian flag behind their profile picture. /s
Protesting the deaths of innocent civilians in Gaza. Completely fair, civilized and normal. Shouting slogans advocating the destruction of the Israeli state and deaths of Jewish people. Not so much.Also don‚Äôt seem the condemnation of Hamas for war crimes of hiding weapons a rockets in civilian sites, but god forbid anyone mentions that.
Decent guy from my hometown. Poor fella had cancer young - he definitely took the 2nd chance with full send mode on.
Because you're talking like a bootcamp rambo.
Ya well we r supporting ukraine already fuck all these people for real I'm tired of seeing young people struggle and not having a life all my guys in my crew r losing their places cause of war.... inflation.... they r so unhappy. As a manager it's fucked to see these guys struggling I fight tooth and nail to get them more but there's nothing to gain. Bro I was making 15 bucks at 22, 23 with a roommate living good in a 3 bedroom house with my roommate making 16... thats unheard of now it's fucked. No wonder they r giving up.... war is fucking everything up lol whatever tho... go america weeeeee hopefully we don't have to blow things up I guess
Holy shit you guys are getting downvote bombed. Do you think it‚Äôs bots or ignorance?
The goal is to bomb the shit out of the north 1/3 of Gaza and move everyone out of there. That's clearly the goal... regardless of if you agree with that goal or not, that is what is being attempted. It's not going to be pretty and it's not going to be easy. I wish they wouldn't try it, but it seems like that's the plan.
Weird, polling, as of this summer, says a majority of the people in Gaza supported maintaining the ceasefire, would rather replace Hamas with PA including disarming Hamas, and half agreed with ‚ÄúHamas should stop calling for Israel‚Äôs destruction, and instead accept a permanent two-state solution based on the 1967 borders‚Äùhttps://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/polls-show-majority-gazans-were-against-breaking-ceasefire-hamas-and-hezbollahAlso that ‚Äòelection‚Äô you‚Äôre using to sentence these civilians to death was almost 20 years ago. Half their population wasn‚Äôt even alive. But don‚Äôt let the facts stand in the way of you explaining why it‚Äôs fine to kill these civilians. Which one of the WW2 antagonists had spent close to a century before the war under occupation as a stateless, rightless people?
Hamas is literally ISIS, if ISIS had its wings clipped by a blockade. Both are Sunni militant groups that want to set up an Islamic caliphate. Both derive their basis from the same philosophical figureheads. In Hamas case, they want the destruction of Israel, the eradication of all Jews, and to enact an Islamic caliphate where Israel currently resides. The rest of the world just ignored them because they primarily functioned around Israel since it is still their #1 enemy. If Israel was no longer there, they would consolidate their power and then branch out trying to take over their neighboring countries. Anyone who thinks otherwise are extremely naive. The only reason ISIS and Hamas went against one another before is because of power. Hamas wasn't going to give up their spot to ISIS. ISIS declared them apostates solely because they were aligned with Iran.
What would the Israeli version of Homelander look like? The cape would be a tallit for sure. Black suit or are we looking at a Zohan with real super powers?

I was thinking the same thing. It feels surreal tbh.
I don't think u get it. Lol it's OK
yis
Go live in Gaza then. Lmao
Now I know that the pilot flying the plane that we're in didn't do anything wrong. My only question is did he live? I think this man sacrificed his existence so the jumpers could live. And usually the pilots are either new to piloting and that they're just trying to get hours or they're retired person flying this for the love of flying. And I say this as somebody who part-time flies over gas lines so that I can see if they are leaking or if there's any visible damage to the pipeline. Which there's no other flying like it because you are so low you actually feel a sense of speed and fun they don't get from flying traditionally.
They expected to get shot they have an ambulance and medical people there
Money foo
Theyve also has some strikes against the west bank of palestine where hamas doesnt even exist (per the idf anyways) It smells
Yup, there is no "good guys" And if everybodies wrong than nobodies right. So i'll take being grateful for not actually having to live in that part of the world and deal with that. That being said, i support the people who would supporr me. That's the most I can do as a dude in the U.S.
Freedom is evil? Human rights is evil? Freedom of speech is evil? Mate you got that backwards.
Seeing as we have had zero video of IDF soldiers being engaged by Hamas militia since the attack in early october ive been of the assumption it was much like a tet offensive sort of situation where the majority and in some cases the entire cell of fighters were killedI watched a video from the israeli prime minister yesterday, a CG video of a "fortress" underneath a large hospital, it reminded me so much of the propoganda we were fed in 2001 about the mountain fortresses that never existed that this entire thing has turned sour.There is no doubt in my mind this is a real estate deal and nothing more. The hamas operatives cannot even be "confirmed" kia as they are being bombed with 2000 pound jdams, there is nothing to "confirm", so i see these daily idf reports, they killed so and so, such and such, i just sit here and go "there is no realistic way the idf could even gather that information"
That's why it's the root of all evil
It has been nearly 20 years for me.  I still think about it frequently.
"after the Nazis invaded the rest of Europe". Said literally no one.
Freedom comes at a price. No amount of money buys freedom. It's priceless.
Yes
Alot of pro-isreal indian bots here yikes.. Anyone with a brain could just open youtube and see unedited footage of the casualties in Gaza.. do you ever see isrealian casualties except military bases ?
Seems like both sides had the ingredients for a shit show they just keep putting it in the same pot.
One more thing to push forward is I would urge you to look at the infrastructure and population density of the Gaza strip.... When you say residential areas in such a highly densely populated compressed area, what do you mean? Pretty much the entire strip could be justified as a residential area as they don't have a lot of industry or commercial infrastructure just a lot of people.
They‚Äôre gonna have to hit Shifa Hospital. Can they get to the deepest tunnels with these bombs??
Well not all of their infrastructure is underground, Hamas acts like a government for the Gaza strip so they have police stations and headquarters and training buildings and all sorts of stuff like that that is above ground... They have bunkers and tunnels for storing weapons and moving throughout the Gaza strip underground but they have a lot of weapons and ammo storage, fuel storage water storage food storage and support buildings on the surface of Gaza. Cadillac saying that during the second world war Nazi Germany had tons of bunkers including city size bunkers that would could hold 30 to 40,000 people at a time so these bunkers are unaffected by bombing for the most part... So then why bomb Germany?In terms of the hospitals, it's been proven that that was a Hamas misfire that hit the hospital parking lot and not the hospital. In terms of bombing churches I don't know of many Christian churches that are in the Gaza strip I do believe it is mainly mosques. but all that being said the civilian infrastructure has been infiltrated by Hamas and their infrastructure which they purposely put in highly densely populated areas or religious structures or health Care facilities or education facilities in order to utilize the civilian population as a human shield.
I get so mad when I see this on other subs, and soe karen is like "have some respect for your position!"  No bitch, have some fun as long its safe and correct!
As you stated there‚Äôs ‚Äúcountless stories‚Äù. There‚Äôs also countless stories of the Lochness Monster, Bigfoot, and people being abducted by little green men and getting probed yet there‚Äôs no evidence of any of them. We‚Äôve seen just from this conflict the stories that Hamas has put out which have turned out to be a crock of bs. We now know it was Terrorists who bombed that hospital, we now know Hamas had orders to massacre everyone they came across, we now know the decapitated babies. From the history of their conflict we know Palestinians had freedom of travel from their territories into Israel (until Israel continues to be attacked by suicide bombers). We know that Israel has elected Palestinians for their government to give them a voice, we know Israel has never sent rockets to their territories even after retaliation from having it done to them. I don‚Äôt have any skin is this game, I just know right from wrong, and can take facts/proof to make an educated opinion of who‚Äôs been the aggressors and who‚Äôs been passive but have finally had enough.
Zionist bots are going hard today huh
Hamas is literally pro war though. Like pro holy war bro? War is horrible.. Your opinion is still valid and downvotes are undeserved.
ü§°ü§°ü§°
I'm sorry, think about what your saying. Why would someone who was actually tried to be made extinct, go the road of genocide? You have been lied to and misled. The have made you look silly. For what? Only you know.
They don't seem to be releasing any footage from that. There were updates to the list of fallen IDF troops. But nothing past video of them rolling into the city..Telegram chatter from the other side is talking about five or six Israeli tanks lost. So you can assume one or two in reality lol
CO2 is legit one of the best ways to die.
Weren‚Äôt most of them safer in Europe, Russia, or the USA where they immigrated from?Weren‚Äôt the Palestinians safer without the state of Israel?

Depends. If your elected government which has support of the population openly declares genocidal ambitions towards a neighbor and then carries out attacks towards this goal, your population is going to suffer. No one felt bad for the Germans or the Japanese getting their cities destroyed and their civilians dying by the millions towards the end of WW2. That is just how war is. If you start shit, expect your population to get decimated if it doesn't go well. Hamas isn't some radical fringe group in Gaza, they are in all intent and purposes the elected government with widespread support. Thus, the civilians are paying a cost of that support with their lives. Just like every other war that has ever happened when governments get them into shit. Stop trying to ask Israel to treat this like some radical hillbilly militia in Oregon, because it isn't the same.
Because they‚Äôre ‚Äúprovoking‚Äù hamas by doing so.They have no clue where they actually are The ‚Äúhamas is hiding under the hospital‚Äù argument is just a dumb argument to continue the genocide in hope of Hamas showing up
This dude you‚Äôre mocking arguably gives the best up front footage and info on ground there now. This war correspondent is fearless lol
How can anyone be this stupid?
Lol if only people picked up a book and had their own opinion. To many followers. Not enough leaders. Fuck it I hope I get a lot more down votes. Lol
I don't think that flair is the most fitting right now
Are you missing your brains?
Dude, living 7km from Gaza, it's like constant thunder here, it's wild.
this sub is pro-israel exclusively homie, of course you're getting downvoted even if you're right.
Opinion polls do though.
Cuz I'm a piloooot!
Hamas main base is under a hospital.
This guy watched way too many cartoons as a kid.
The issue is whats considered occupied territory though. Which is why this conflict has gone on for generations. While I don't like the framing of "civilians don't deserve safety" , as that's not far from the people that summarize the Oct 7th massacres as "settlers aren't civilians and that child and grandma are settlers" , I do agree that the settlers in the west bank are incredibly inflammatory, counterproductive and illegal. But the issue obviously isn't just the west bank settlement expansions, many Palestinians and their leaders still reject the idea of Israel as a country in general and see the whole region as theirs and theirs only, and the UN partition plan in the late 40s would have finally given them a proper legal nation state with defined borders and self governance. Instead they declared and lost one of many wars If you don't see all of Israel outside of the west bank as occupied territory, then the Oct 7th massacre that triggered this round of war wasn't a case of safety in occupied territory. There was also a ceasefire until that day.. didn't exactly work out well. It's all fucked. Both groups deserve a safe nation state to call home with access to their religious sites without fear of persecution or attacks from their neighbours. I'm just not sure how to get there
This needs to stop, ceasefire now. War sucks.
Do not bring a rock to a gunfight.

Nosewheel steering, mainly. Asymmetric braking can help, but it's a no-go above a certain ground speed, too much heat and therefore wear on your brakes. It's also part of why the USAF likes to aerobrake and use long runways when landing - less brake wear means you can use smaller brakes, saving size and thus weight on non-combat components of fighters

And if you yell "Israel has the right to defend itself" from the rooftops despite 6,400+ Palestinians being directly killed by Israeli forces before the events of the 7th,  you're vying for dead Palestinians.
Holy sh\*t bro , what are you doing . :D Don't risk your life for likes :D Get your most important things , leave the house and wait for help :D

Rudimentary? How else would you steer a plane until you get rudder authority?
Wait, so 97% of the Palestinian population is, per Israel, not Hamas terrorists? And you‚Äôre wondering why people have taken issue with the IDF having dropped more bombs on them in 2 weeks than the US dropped in a year in Afghanistan?
Easy!

Genuine question, whose air space is the red sea?
That‚Äôs your issue. This is not Germany that went off the rails for 10 years then rejoined Western society. Or Japan. This is not Northern Ireland either. The Middle East is ruled by dictators for a reason. If they let the people decide then they will choose radical Islamists. Why do you think the U.S. stopped support the Arab Spring. Israel gave Gaza autonomy and they elected Hamas. And here we are
They‚Äôre not fighting. My drill sergeant always said if you hear someone say they fought for their country ask them, who did you fight, what were they wearing.
I love how all my comments are getting downvoted haha. I wanted to fight, somebody‚Äôs got to.
If anyone needed a reason to finally leave the cesspit of misinformation and hysterical extremism that is Twitter, it's the absolute shite being posted wall-to-wall about this conflict.On the other hand, conflating Hamas with ISIS and referencing polls conducted in a territory with a totalitarian government that murders all dissenters is ridiculous. Gazans don't need "re-education", they need a viable future.
Looks like something you would see in a Call of Duty campaign mission.
Is it possible that you don't realize that Pakistan has nukes?That's the reason why we also didn't invade Pakistan and is also a big part of the reason we weren't able to almost entirely eradicate the Taliban like we were able to do with ISIS.We were able to set up a strong military presence in both countries that they operated in, which allowed the coalition to royally fuck them up.So, no, the reason we weren't fucking with Pakistan wasn't because they had *less* Taliban there.  At the time Pakistan was the center of operations for Al-Qaeda since the Taliban kicked them out of Afghanistan after shielding them for some time, trying to avoid a war with the west (which didn't work, because Bush was like "what? They're in Pakistan?!  They've got nukes....we can't attack them....but we have to do *something*...fuck it, the Taliban is pretty much Al-Qaeda anyway").We didn't fuck with Taliban because they have ICBMs and we're not trying to risk shit
Iran has been 6 months from joining the funni owners club since uhh... 2000.
They think that anyone who is pro Palestine (or just Palestinian!) has to start and end every comment with three sentences about condemning hamas or they support mass murder and rape. If you are talking to someone who you have reason to believe us even in the slightest bit rational that isn‚Äôt a question that is even worth asking. The answer is so insanely obvious. It‚Äôs just a way to redirect away from what is happening *right now* and make it seem that people who support Palestine are in any way okay with what happened on October 7th. Bc people get frustrated being asked that, as it equates the Palestinian cause with Hamas, which is an extremist response to the occupation. It is entirely separate from what people are protesting for.
They had weeks to evacuate.How much time did Hamas give to the ravers to evacuate?
Hamas fucked up big time on this one.  And the cheerful, celebratory attitude of the civilians didn't help their case at all.
Why not just RC cars propelled by compressed VX gas? You send a train that spreads one can at a time as it goes down tunnels, and splits off at junctions.
the 'proposed borders' have consistently required palestinians to accept israeli 'settlers' (read: invaders who have crossed previously-agreed borders and violently evicted palestinians). if you read any of these proposed peace agreements, you'd know they're pure bullshit designed to insult the palestinian people, forcing them to accept concessions that nobody could possibly brook. the best possible comparison point would be if russia said they'd offer peace to ukraine, provided ukraine cedes all the land that russia has taken so far, unilaterally disarms (without russia having to do the same) and refuses to prosecute any of the war crimes committed in the process. imagine if that happened, and then russia started saying it was ukraine's fault everything was all fucked up because they won't accept peace. it's obscene!

More swinging in the dark razing Gaza to the ground?  8000 innocent Palestinian lives have been lost.  This whole conflict has been stupid and lopsided for decades.  Of course Israel thinks their shit don't stink and Palestine has had no one to turn to but gangsters.  Frowns for humanity all around.

No unarmed Israeli is getting murdered or raped.. atleast not getting murdered intentionally.Abduction of innocents.. that's to achieve our political objectives and demands. If you were God's chosen people then god should be protecting you but instead you people are getting f'ed since centuries. You will get a rise for a while but that's okay and should happen so that Imam Mahdi and Jesus could come and do their job. That's why non-Arab Muslims and Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan also exist today.So f\*ck off now.

Are Palestinians treated equally by the law when they‚Äôre forced to traverse through checkpoints every day and have their front doors welded shut on the streets they are not allowed to go?
Not everyone is an Israeli, American or ISIS. Thank you.
&gt;People all over the WORLD are marching in the THOUSANDS in support of Palestine. From the UK to France to Ireland to Afghanistan to LA to New York. The UN called for a ceasfire. Thousands of people are donating to Palestinian aid and causes.Yup. Israel/US media can't cope that it's not 2004 anymore. Bush-era tactics don't work anymore. There's a reason why there are a lot more protests this time around, people realize the bullshit thanks to social media.
I made an 85 with a 126 GT score. I wanted to fight.

What a goddamn mess.  Good luck and Godspeed to Israel and Palestine.
It's cause the conflict did not come out of nowhere. You had the 2021 conflict begin with Israel aggresion storming the al-aqsa mosque, you had amnesty international declare apartheid on Israel before Oct 7, you had 75+ years of conflict behind it. People are waking up. If you go to the average person protesting, odds are, they will say killing innocent israelis is bad. But Israel is using this as an excuse to carpet bomb innocent palestinians in return, to the point where even some israelis don't care for the hostageshttps://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/1796q3h/father_of_israeli_hostage_is_attacked_in_tel_aviv/k548enf/

Bud, I've seen you all over reddit. You're just an ACT.IL shill mouthpiece for Apartheid Israel. All your arguments are disingenuous.Apartheid Israel needs to stop with the indiscriminate bombing and killing of civilians, apartheid policies, stealing land and ethnic cleansing. Now they're even attacking the freedom of their own citizens.Ethnic cleansing is genocide.

What if we just leveled Gaza (giving innocent civies new homes, ofc) and pave over the entire region in asphalt for the world's largest parking lot. Can't surface when there's a layer of heavy ass rock and tar!
And this is just the secondary weapon. My car got hit multiple times with the primary and I still haven't fully gotten the stain out.
I wasn‚Äôt aware of the 3000 fighters rumor, which is absurd.It‚Äôs also obvious and documented that they train and field teenagers under 18 and use younger kids as courriers.I think the ideal solution for after the war would be a transitory regime led by a coalition of Egypt, Saudi Arabia and some international elements rather than an Israeli occupation.
If you would tell me to imagine a New Yorker. It would be that guy.
If they continue this way, they will destroy all buidlings, no difference than carpet bombing.
get your hands off my schmeky!
Nope. You take out as many as possible before your ground invasion. Once you take over an area they will then fill in everything with concrete. Egypt actually pumped gas into the tunnels near their border on top of filling some in with concrete. They figured the gas was better than trying to clear the stupid things manually and possibly encountering resistance.
What kind of crimes were those that happened when hamas went into Isreal on Oct. 7?

I‚Äôve been in firefights with the taliban man. Which is why I think the dancing is cheesy lol. I have family members that are eagle drivers, it‚Äôs still cheesy.
Why the fuck is this a thing , seriously who believe that ??
Nah man, at the end of the day we are all just human. It's amazing of all the things we have accomplished despite our human condition. Have you seen the video where the Army was continuing to grill steaks in the middle of a Taliban fire fight?
I was watching the skyline Gaza streams during their night time hours. It was the most intense bombing and small arms fire I had heard since the war started. You could see illumination flares going up in the distance and hear what sounded like helicopter chainguns going off. It didn't sound as "beefy" as the AA guns that we heard a couple weeks ago from Hamas some nights. As of just a couple minutes ago during the daylight hours in Gaza, you can hear smaller arms going off. More so than in previous days.
And when you hear the people who support em say that the population should harbor and help hamas fighters xDCry some more terrorist scumbags
Uhm song name? U/savevideo
It just seems unprofessional. And further reinforces my belief that the Air Force is a corporation and not a branch of the military lol
Or flyers for Nickelback shows.
There was Taliban in Pakistan, but we didn't kill a bunch of Pakistani civilians. We focused primarily on the center of Taliban activity, Afghanistan, and had limited skirmishes in Pakistan. We sure as fuck didn't kick Pakistanis out of their homes, build our own homes, and then have our military protect Americans who killed Pakistani civilians from time to time.And hey, since we're on the topic of Pakistan, we found out that bin Laden was staying there and we managed to not bomb his entire city block. We put boots on the ground and they only killed people who were threats, not children and unarmed women.
üòû
Ok, but hear put my counterargument.It would be cool AF.
What are you talking about. Did you take half a second to read it and completely took it out of context. You know why, i did 2 tours in Afghanistan and every time you stepped out of the FOB everybody looked like your enemy so fuck you
"Consider yourself smote."

We need more love for the Doobies. No one stays flaccid when the dozer starts to fuck shit up, takes a direct hit, doesn‚Äôt care, and continues to fuck shit up.
You gotta have some fun even at work man.
And then didn't tell the medics what it was, meaning they didn't know that Narcan would have saved a ton of the hostages.
Hmmmm... Today I will throw a stone at a person with a rifle. I'm sure that action will have noooo consequences whatsoever...
I'm thrilled that this is it's own Wikipedia page
There governing body should have thought about that before they did what they did. You can stop your little feet all you want. Go grab a sign and protest or head to the land you love so much. Strap a bomb to your chest and do the work they so desperately want you to do. Your life means nothing to Hamas. You think anything else matters to them except causing as much pain to Jews as possible despite how many innocent Palestinians will die as a result?! You can‚Äôt even denounce mass murder, rape and kidnapping. You think that was justifiable? You are apart of the world‚Äôs problems then. Cry all you want. They asked for it now they are getting it. And I‚Äôm going to fill u in on a secret you already know. The rest of the East won‚Äôt help you cause they don‚Äôt want to have the same fate to fall on them. This is happening and it is not going to stop. This is WAR! People fucking die in war. This all could have been prevented. There are consequences to actions. And it just so happens they started a war knowing they can‚Äôt win. All in the name of hatred. Dumb fucks
I wish more videos and photos existed of the D-Day landings.  The opening scene of Saving Private Ryan is one of the most harrowing scenes ever filmed for a movie.
That's pretty much what it is: GO ported to Source 2 with some feature and frontend updates.Hence it straight-up replacing GO in people's libraries.
You know... I've been thinking a lot last two decades...  Ideas are real.  A collective has a soul of its own: Collective value system, collective emotion, collective "Facts they \[think\] they know".Hamas is it's own collective. People join Hamas and become Hamas and they die but Hamas is still there.Gaza is like 1 Million children. All they've ever known is bombings and assassinations. I cried during the terror attack on Israel but how could we ever expect them to be any different?The collective idea of Hamas is doing better than ever.(as for all a yall "but Israel is just destroying Hamas launchers", etc - don't solutionize me. I didn't allude to an anti-Israeli solution. I don't think there IS a solution at all. The world is not mature enough to deal with the stuff that needs to happen to solve this. Most people are still babies)
The greatest generation
Modern Western militaries will have junctional tourniquets that are applied around the hips kind of like a belt, with an inflatable bulb that compresses the femoral artery above the leg. You can make a makeshift one with something like a lacrosse ball, a sheet, and something like a pipe or piece of rebar to serve as a windlass. The ball goes over the femoral artery at the pelvis, and the sheet is tied  tightly around the waist, holding the ball in place. the windlass is inserted between the sheet and patients hips and twisted to cinch down the sheet which will apply pressure to the ball and hopefully occlude the femoral artery. I've never personally tried this and it wasn't "officially" taught to me as something to use in the field, kind of an off the book thing one of the Paramedics at my EMS agency brought up.As others have said, EMS can also pack this wound with (ideally hemostatic) gauze. This tends to work well if done correctly, but most people, even trained EMS responders, don't do it correctly by not keeping constant pressure with one hand while feeding the gauze. It's a skill that needs to be practiced.The issue is, all of these options are temporary, the second you remove a tourniquet or yank out the packed gauze, the bleeding will start again. He needs a trauma center, and it sounds like the Hospital situation in Gaza is...not ideal at the moment.
Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters have begun gathering in London for a protest urging an end to Israel's attacks in Gaza.Last weekend, 100,000 people took to the streets of the capital demanding an end to the bombing in Gaza, and police expect similar numbers again.Rallies are expected in many UK cities, including Manchester and Glasgow.The demos come as Israel expands its strikes, three weeks after Hamas launched an attack on its territory.On Saturday afternoon, crowds started to gather near the Golden Jubilee Bridge holding signs saying "Gaza, stop the massacre" and "Free Palestine, end Israeli occupation".A sound system led people to chant "Stop arming Israel. Stop bombing Gaza", "We are all Palestinian" along with a slogan saying "From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free."London demonstration Police warned people to expect large crowds in the Westminster area next to the River Thames Home Secretary Suella Braverman had previously urged police chiefs to consider interpreting the "river to the sea" chant as an "expression of a violent desire to see Israel erased from the world".Large crowds are expected to gather around the Embankment, Whitehall, Strand, Westminster and Waterloo Bridge, the Metropolitan Police said.The force said more than 1,000 officers have been deployed.Elsewhere in the UK, thousands attended a pro-Palestinian rally outside Manchester's Central Library at St Peter's Square.[Source](https://www.aol.com/gaza-protest-london-sees-thousands-111528606.html)

&gt;Can't we ALL agree that killing innocent civilians and kidnapping them regardless of religion or geological location is wrong?Wow that's so progressive, I think you've solved the issue.
If you can call what he is doing living to begin with...
I wish Reddit still had awards, because this comment deserves one.  "all disruption is good because it gets people talking about your cause!!!" is such a simpleminded take on the subject.  The ordinary people whose day you ruin may be talking about you but not in a positive way.
So you think that would work? You really think any IDF soldier isnt looking at everyone with the suspicion of them being a hamas supporter already?Did you think this through for more than half a second?
I cannot think of any.
Makes things simpler for the IDF xDImagine thinking the solutions is making everyone a target and thinking it will solve something
I love how everyone loves to scream about fucking out and finding out on the internet until literally right this second.
If you were there, you'd be dead is what you would be.
Seems like they did a nice make up session again. This looks like fake blood to me.Its really insulting that they do all this fake videos. I'm sure there are enough real casualties they could publish. But no, they decide to flood everything with their propaganda and videos full of actors painted with dust and fake blood. Do you realise that there are many videos, where you don't see any wound on anybody. But blood is always everywhere.
Slingshots are probably the oldest known projectile weapon to mankind. How deadly they can be would depend on how hard it‚Äôs thrown, the sling itself, and what the projectile is made of. For example, Ancient Romans would use lead for slingshot pelts and research showed that if used right it could do as much damage to a person as a handgun.
This shit is so cringe.
If they don't occupy it, someone else will occupy it.
Underground targets, which are civilian buildings.
They are cooperating with Hamas. I am glad you feel justified to support what Hamas did to innocent civilians. You will have to live with this regret, not I
or do it the egyptian way and use sewageits more expensive but it does send a message
The protesters ignore the truth because they want the extermination of the Jews. This has nothing to do with freedom of the Palestinians.The Palestinians are freely protesting in North Americian cities. They are freely breaking our laws and promoting hate speech.

Isreal wanted to declare anyone not leaving Gaza a terrorist. And everyone else started giving them the side eye.
Honestly, I dont get why muslin countries on the other side of the continent care so much about Israel and palestine.... Ir√°n? I get it, people in Irak? understandable...But what do people in malaysia have on this anyway? Last time I checked the prominent sect in malay and palestine mutually hated each other.
But still killing Pigs.

The Russians, Chinese and Iranians have no chance against this level of flair.
So you support the murder, rape and abduction of innocents and the genocide of Gods chosen people. Does that make you a terrorist too?  I think so.
We, in America, just *cannot* hold moral authority when we are saying X war crimes are not ok, but Y war crimes are cool. War crimes are war crimes. We cannot hold up international law and point at some people wagging our fingers while ignoring the same laws that and embracing our allies that might be committing the same crimes.There are some pundits I respect and like who have taken this approach that we must defend Israel at all costs. NO. We must defend humanity and what is right. That includes defending Israel's right to defend itself, but it also includes sticking up for ethnic populations that have war crimes committed against them.
That plus, Our parents, relatives and community won‚Äôt be proud of us if we got shot and injured or died there. From what I‚Äôve heard from friends who have relatives over there, this was probably the best outcome for him given the circumstances. He‚Äôll now get good treatment and once he‚Äôs fit to travel, he‚Äôll be on the fast track to be rehabilitated in the EU or US or Middle East with a job and sufficient funding for initial support. Once there he will be a local hero and encourage others to keep the movement alive and become part of local area protests etc.
It already is a terrorist state, 31-50% support attacks on Israel civilians - so ever second to third - if that doesn't qualify I don't know what would - just image where u live every third to second would say it's ok to rape some kid from kindergarten u are feeling u need a fuck
Put ur money where ur mouth is and buy a ticket and fight for your beloved sharia state as terrorist. But please keep us posted if u rape a young women or kill some children with ur gun to their head.

The only thing you can morally tear down are those "I buy houses for CASH" signs
Looks like a lot of Palestinians supporting Hamas fighters right there but on TV lots of tears yet we see the reality of the relationship.   Herding sheep in the day planting IED's and firing RPG's at night.

I have the solution... Back in the late 50s the US had an experimental program called Project Plowshare...
I'm sure if I started hurling rocks with a sling at my local armed police they would probably shoot me too, and I don't even live in a war zone.
The thing is nobody knows what could be inside the slingshot. It could be a rock, as well as any other explosive, so IDF should stay and do nothing?
A big water pump is cheap, kilotons of molten aluminium are expensive AF
You can control a lot of bleeding with wound packing and pressure. Wounds to the shoulder or hip area aren't a death sentence.
Imagine thinking it couldnt have happened, but building tunnels and smuggling weapons was simpler....
Things could be done secretly and through deception too üòí
Good
Ok, hear me out...Have you ever seen those videos on youtube about making ant colony aluminum moldings...
No, they literally built it when they occupied Gaza.  That‚Äôs why Israel knows the layout.https://www.tabletmag.com/sections/news/articles/top-secret-hamas-command-bunker-in-gaza-revealed
That's exactly what it is. They know what they are doing and don't even try hide that's why he's on top of a big container but I'm sure media headlines will be different.

You can try and compress the femoral artery in the groin. Works pretty well, but requires a person to keep that pressure up until you make it to surgery. Which is a challenge even on smooth Western European roads. But better than not trying...

Is there a way to annihilate their whole underground network in one go instead of having to play whack-a-mole with air strikes?
He was put in that position for propaganda purposes.
I love the ominous 40 foot long corridors with no rooms next to them. Like they just built rooms randomly underground and then connected them with tunnels
Hmm they had the press there filming and emergency services waiting...it's almost like they know people are fking stupid on this subject and will just see some poor little innocent guy being shot by the evil IDF. Guess what...fk around and find out.
Mmmm insertion hole
you didn‚Äôt make one point about what i said. all you did was whataboutism. yes the people who died on the 7th are travesties and their families are suffering very strongly..but that doesn‚Äôt stop the fact that israel is LITERALLY having concerts and parties at the moment while palestinians are dying. what do you have to say to the 7000 palestinians dead 3000 of them children? nothing. because you don‚Äôt care about them. my boy go on snapchat and press on israel and you will see all the disco music playing and people walking around the streets having fun. go onto gaza and you will only see ruins and bombs being dropped.
Not massive enough because the Hamas terrorists are still goin at it without any care for the Palestinians‚Ä¶
Big ole cavity to bleed into too. If that was the external bleeding he could well have similar internally.Homeboy is in trouble, medics or not.
Hamas has a huge stockpile of food, water, fuel, medicine, and medical supplies to sustain them for *months* of fighting:https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/27/world/middleeast/palestine-gazans-hamas-food.htmlBut guess who won't ever see any of those supplies, despite desperately needing them? The civilians of Gaza, of course! As always, Hamas couldn't care less about their own people and is happy to let them suffer.
Wow that's a lot of tunnels
This, he's using a shepherds sling and it could definitely kill someone
Yup, David with slingshot vs Goliath. I'll take David everytime. With lead shot, slingshots can do a grizzly amount of damage.
NCDers: "We dont advocate for genocide!"Also NCDers:
They won't don't worry the reddit medics are on it
Every country that borders Palestine cut off movement when Hamas took power.  Not just Israel.  Are you protesting Egypt as well?
In 2006. They haven't elected representatives or a president since then. Hardly say that proves support
Alot of blood on the hands of Hamas.
Genocide?Pick any ten-year period between 1948 and now.  Pick a couple.  You will find that the population of Palestinians in Gaza in the West Bank and the population of Israeli Arabs has grown consistently for all of them.On the other hand, if you look at the population of Jews, in Gaza, Jordan, Egypt, Syria, etc. you‚Äôll find that they have all been removed.I struggle to understand how people like you would call the first genocide, and not say anything to me about the second.  Only thing that makes sense to me as to why you call a growing population of arabs genocide, but didn‚Äôt say anything about Jews actually being ethnically cleansed countries blatant antisemitism.
3000 black crows of Netanyahu?
Its the same as saying someone with a knife stabbing a police officer isn't a valid target for gunshots.Those idiots don't care they just want to hate Israel and Jews
Approx 40,000 for Hamas, 15,000 for PIJEdit: people will really downvote anything lol
Of course it is. 21th century War is about information operations being a major component. Now if you are not even strong enough to be considered an insurgency, more like a powerful Street gang information ops will be the largest component of the conflict.
Putang Ina!
When did I even imply any of that? What is this ridiculous strawmanning? You said nobody was defending Hamas, I provided evidence of people flat out cheering them on. Nothing you just said is actually replying to me.
Yep. Not exactly staged but they knew exactly what would happen.
What in the living fuck is wrong with you people...
They knew it would happen. Conveniently placed cameras too. This is just people poking a bear and playing the victim when they get bit.
I guess we shouldn't call for a ceasefire because a twitch chat did something you didn't like. Sorry chat, this is your fault, you caused Hamas to attack and are responsible for Israel's ongoing ethic cleansing campaign.
IDF has already killed several of their own hostages. Of the 2000+ casualties so far, around only 15 or 18 have been confirmed as Hamas.
Yeah baby, that's what i've bee waiting for, that's what it's all about
Yeah people in America really think of themselves a lot. A good chunk of these dudes don‚Äôt care if they die. It‚Äôs all bout pushing the cause forward. Don‚Äôt know how u deal with thatü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The fuck is this comment lol. Are you proud of the fact that America firebombed the fuck out of Dresden? It‚Äôs one thing to complete a necessary, but horrible task, and it‚Äôs another to take pride in it
If I ever get my hands on a large estate I‚Äôm definitely digging underground tunnels and connecting them to the houses through secret doors that activate by pulling on the right book
I don't think that analogy is exactly an apt one. I don't know enough about the Israel Palestine conflict to know which came first; the chicken or the egg. However I do know that Israel has done their fair share of killing of innocent civilians. That doesn't excuse the heinous and vile acts committed by Hamas, but you can only throw rocks at a wasp nest for so long before it swarms (same metaphor could be applied to Israel from Hamas pov).  A more apt analogy would be the US in the middle east. Al Qaeda committed a massive terrorist attack (9/11), and in the process of hunting down and killing those terrorists millions of innocent people died that had nothing at all to do with 9/11.
How many enemies are estimated? 10,000?
There is a huge aquifer under Gaza.
So you want to have all the gaza civilians to become terrorists and then it's a terrorist state. Think things through man!
Oh my god, Israel has invented ornithopters.
This is far to credible to be credible around these parts.I recommend we strap PE4 to geese and set them loose in the tunnels for a honkin good time.
I understand how ridiculous the whole situation is very well, but thank you for the academic exercise.
They should at least try a great leap forward for once.
Oh hey I can see my grandpa from there!
What you gunna do? Shoot me while I'm doing 100 in a 50 zone üëÄ

toe brake. quick snap taps. get good bouncy boy action :D  sorry realized what sub i replied in. let me rephrase: they just slap their fat nuts on the brake pedals in between moving it around their insertion hole for constant flight penetration.
Gas pedal plus short taps on the brake? Translated to plane terms of course.
Naw, the pilot's tapping them toe brakes.  The  top of the rudder pedals are the landing gear breaks and can be used as a rudimentary way to control the jet during taxi if you apply them asymmetrically.
The biggest political streamer's chat was spamming "FROM RIVER TO SEA" and cheering on the attacks in real time as they were being reported on.
But they don't deserve safety in occupied territory tbh.That would be the line for me.Just like Nazis did not have the right to march through France or Poland or Russians not having the rights to march through Ukraine.
You can't use your *bite* attack and be kosher, though.
People forget those things were weapons of war for a very long time for many different groups of people. Yeah technology advanced but our heads didn't evolve in that time to be able to suddenly survive a rock at that speed. Unless as you say, helmets are involved.
Kinda curious how they did thatI'm guessing just the pilot jumping around in the cockpit isn't enough, right?
If you hit someone in the face with a slingshot that long, you kill them. Especially if you use lead ammunition.
Ok so its pretty much confirmed that Hamas is an Iran proxy. So remember last year when those big Iran protests were happening and we all hoped for a democratic revolution. Whatever happened to those? Surely the Mossad now has a justification to send covert help in the name of democracy, since two can play the proxy game.
It has been proven beyond any doubt that Hamas hides its tunnels and infrastructure under hospitals, civilian complexes and schools. [The Israeli Government has been warning that Hamas uses the al-Shifa hospital as a base since 2009.](https://t.co/MdMxk9QbdN) [There is even reports of Amnesty Int'l on Hamas using Al-Shifa to torture dissidents in 2014.](https://www.amnesty.org/es/documents/mde21/1643/2015/en/)Don‚Äôt be so fucking biased.
Pilots would find these moves hilarious *if* they were paying the slightest attention.
Nah, CoD now is never dipping its toe into offensive territory. When was the last time CoD had an actual swastika to show that its Germany?
I swear they just updated Global Offensive and called it CS2
It's like David vs Goliath except Goliath has a gun!
Nah, this is every day. When it's go time, the crew chiefs start breaking out the real moves. Some of them involve costumes.
Just rockets barrages from civilians areas, mostly near and from hospitals, nurseries, kindergartens etc. All of this from the center and south of the strip where IDF agreed for humanitarians safe zones.North side of the strip completely not functioning, they won't face the IDF infront, they will wait for ground troops to advance forward enough and then they will pop out from tunnels and attack as guerrilla, ambushes, hit and run, thousands of booby traps everywhere..I assume most of them are already assimilated inside civilians and the elites are underground waiting for an option to save their lives in some kind of an hostages deal.
One guy with a sling shot and 30 medics with a backboard already prepared. Was this guy trying to be shot for the camera? Cuz thats exactly what this looks like.Also this guy is dead, looks like a classic t box shot to the pelvis. They taught us to shoot here in the Marines to stop someone from advancing because it collapses their frame (useful for qrf responding to a suicide vest at the gate or something) but it also will make you bleed out fast as shit.
Pretty sure medical services are overwhelmed.  So that's why there are 10 medics there.
They don't get my sympathy just because they're losing. Actively fighting back makes you fair play for getting shot at. That's just how war works.
Fucking Maggots. Filmcrew and response team standing by, knowing exactly what will happen, he got what he deserved this is just staged for getting some isreal is bad foot.
israel is having parties and concerts right now lol. while palestinians are being bombarded, you are so dense.people downvote when they hear the truth. they have so much hate for palestinians and muslims that they‚Äôre okay with genocide. and they call US antisemitic for being anti zionism, while they support genocide.
Idf = evil
America: FAFO

If only there were some famous story in both their religions about a youth killing a fully armored soldier with a slingshot.
They were literally weapons of war alongside bows and crossbows.Anyone that claims that this type of slingshot is not a deadly weapon may as well be claiming that a knife isn't deadly.
Gaza is 25kmx9km wide‚Ä¶ The story that Israel did not have intelligence on what happened two weeks ago seems like it is something for little children.Hamas is the biggest gift for Israel and now to complete their ethic cleansing campaign that tbey dreamed about for a long time.All of a sudden they have thousands if targets‚Ä¶
Fuck Gaza . Fuck Hamas . And fuck your feelings .
Slings have been a weapon of war for thousands of years. Haven‚Äôt these people heard of David and Goliath?
[2000 Camp David Summit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2000_Camp_David_Summit)Israel had peace talks, gave generosity concessions (that most israelis thought were too big) including borders and Arafat and Palenstine rejected that and gifted Israel the [second Intifada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Intifada) and Hamas as a reward for trying to broker a peacefull resolution.&gt;Dennis Ross, the US Middle East envoy and a key negotiator at the summit, summarized his perspectives in his book The Missing Peace. During a lecture in Australia, Ross suggested that the reason for the failure was Arafat's unwillingness to sign a final deal with Israel that would close the door on any of the Palestinians' maximum demands, particularly the right of return. Ross claimed that what Arafat really wanted was "a one-state solution. Not independent, adjacent Israeli and Palestinian states, but a single Arab state encompassing all of Historic Palestine".[42] Ross also quoted Saudi Prince Bandar as saying while negotiations were taking place: "If Arafat does not accept what is available now, it won't be a tragedy; it will be a crime."[43]
&gt;Say ‚Äúgas‚Äù and people get twitchy.That's because they remember the last time they had Taco Bell
that was clearly a well placed round into his femoral artery. unless they completely stopped the bleeding in the first two minutes, which i doubt, hes likely dead.

I seriously will never understand how people can say, with a straight face, that there is no Hamas in the [west bank](https://www.dni.gov/nctc/ftos/hamas_fto.html).You guys act as if militant groups are constrained within borders.There were also no Taliban in Pakistan, because that wasn't Afghanistan /s
It‚Äôs NCD, we should just use those tunnels to dump nuclear waste, you know, two birds with one stone
cs_hospital
Yeah now I‚Äôm going to need to see the rest of the fleet doing it too
Who gives a fuck about 200 hostages? israeli terrorists have murdered 1000s of kids with their air strikes. They're not trying to free any hostages, nor trying to kill Hamas militants, they're targeting civilian buildings and they're murdering sleeping kids, women, men.

Israel built the fortress whilst they had forces in Gaza pre 2006, they would know

War only has the rules we decide it has and they exist as long as our will for civility in violence exists, by extent these rules and laws can be ignored / overturned at our own whims making them worth about as much as the paper they are written on.Might is the only indisputable rule of war, you can see a prime recent example reinforcing this notion in the Ukraine / Russia conflict.Israeli Citizens pay taxes to their government and in turn the government is meant to provide them services / protection, they should not consider wasting a single cent, or risk a single soldiers life with concerns for the wellbeing of those in another region.
I need me a f 16 lowriderEdit: i just noticed the pilot vibing
Can you explain where exactly hamas is fighting and launching counter attacks from? How are they even still functioning after all the bombs
Meanwhile people where I live: *Casually sip tea and hope that both sides shut up*
That F16 bounce was dope af
What kind of medics hold a stretcher over their heads like that? They aren't catching some kitten off a tree.
Because it‚Äôs staged for propaganda.
Ask yourself why they don't have the infrastructure to provide utilities for themselves. Because any aid that gets delivered gets funneled into weapon building. Hamas were happy to show the world them digging up the water pipes supplied from Israel and repurposing them as fuel containers for rockets. Same when the EU sent materials for water supply. Israel can't deny Gaza access to utilities. But that does not translate to having an obligation to supply them. No country is obligated to provide anything to another. You would hope they would if needed, but when a populace votes in and supports a government that literally have the destruction and genocide of the nation that is supplying it's utilities in its charter, it's a bit fucked up to expect them to facilitate your infrastructure. Let's not forget, the blockade is enforced by both Israel and Egypt and the president of Palestine has spoke out in favour of it.
Anyone play Fallout Shelter? It was a sweet game
The land belongs to whomever controls and the Palestinians are gonna find out who‚Äôs really in control.
If the dude throwing the stone has the foresight have 4 to 5 paramedics and an ambulance on site‚Ä¶ Why is he screaming that he got shot? Is he surprised at this point? Seems like he was prepared for this exact outcome. Good on him for thinking ahead!
He did, looks like he died on the way down tbh
This is actually a monthly bike ride that has been going on for 19 years in Madrid to call for less cars and more bike lanes.This time it was in honour of people being killed in Palestine, but, as you can see, there were no banners or flags, so the guy in the car had no idea that there was any connection to Palestine. He was just mad that, for once, bikes had priority in a small stretch of road and decided to try to murder some people to get back home faster.By the way, he was caught because the psychopath then went to the police to try to report the cyclists for attacking him.
Fairly certain they were going for a David vs. Goliath video to post on social media as propaganda. I'm sure they will edit out the part where he got shot....
Counter suggestion.Chlorine triflouride.
This pretty much sums up the conflict over the last decades.
No shit, and he let himself get pulled away too.  Smart dude.  None of this 'hold me back bro'
Wish fulfilled
You know, if I were in Israel doing Hamas stuff I don't think I'd hang around for 20 hours waiting for someone with a gun to ruin me day.
This looks staged.
Quickest ER I ever seen it's almost memeistic
Hamas...who they voted for and support.
I said it before and I'll say it again, just flood Gaza. Doesn't have to go too high because we just wanna give their sewer system a good flush
The title on this post plays right into this too. Throws a stone with a slingshot? Slingshots are weapons. You can kill someone with a slingshot. Granted, you probably aren't killing someone wearing a ballistic helmet, but this isn't an 11 year old tossing a stone.
That's why you're alive and he is not.
Angry Birds have come a long way since I last played it, to be honest
In all fairness, this is not true. There's countless stories of settlers literally taking peoples home when they go grocery shopping or to the Drs, with the army backing them. Any lets not count the countless deaths, bombings and incursions over the past decades.learning to live with one another, doesnt mean carrying around a big stick and beating anyone who looks at you, meanwhile taking their homes.
That's what I was wondering about. Thanks for your replies and stay safe!

Hamas isn't gonna do anything here - its Irael doing all the bombing/killing in this video. Its just objective fact.
Written and directed by Mel Brooks.
Can it be felt like natural thunder or is it just the sound?
Dude bedrock is at like Y -50 or something like that nowadays
If you were aiming to get shot, slingshotting rocks at armed soldiers during a time of war seems like an excellent way to achieve it.
When an invading army tells you to leave your entire livelihood, so they can bomb it so you won't come back... that's not a legitimate request.
You can have bretons ü§°But fr it's related to how in the game you can have kids (I think) and that's created memes about Tiber septim and an argonian and etc that're just funny in lore context
Lol. 2 ambulances alrdy there waiting and 10 paramedics on standby. That's a better response than I would get.Also it's some Darwin award shit right there.
Gaza is going to go full Mao, aren't they?
Was that a crow
Looked like a pelvis area hit, you got a lot of pipes running through that area. 556 into your pelvis is prolly going to frag a shit load of bone into those pipes.Good luck getting a tourniquet on that shit.
FYI Those are Israeli kidnapped babies
They obviously used [PUPS](https://youtu.be/nSA3EoWQdnk?si=Xo7Jl4UT_r22mray) drones.
Also I would like to connect with anyone here who can help me donate H\*mas. I used to be in contact with a H\*mas commander but I don't hear much from him since the war and the account where I used to send funds is closed or just not able to receive anything.
Don‚Äôt want ‚ÄúgEnoCiDE‚Äù, don‚Äôt start a war, even if history is on your side
Made them go in the underground bunkers because of the small ground invasion and then smacked them.
Not to mention, it's free speech.
Which is pretty much a death sentence right? Isn‚Äôt that not always easy to apply a tourniquet to?
F*ck around and find out?
No need to scoot if you are firing from a hospital or a school or a hotel, because Israel avoids striking those places.
Dumbest shit I‚Äôve ever seen.
my dumb ass nearly thought we were talking about the shuttle.
Yeah the problem is, they‚Äôre not asking for the release of hostages either. And specifically in New York they‚Äôre ripping down signs of hostages out of protest.
And kill as many of their own people, who will go to heaven. And they get more donations from the world by showing off the number of casualties.
I require the recipe to those cookies.
Hi I'm Jedha Knoxbulla and this is Jackass

Clearly, they were looking to provoke the soldiers to fire. Why else would a whole medical team and cameraman be standing at the ready to take action?
Looks pretty high on the thigh , maybe a good case for a triangle tourniquet set up
Mostly thunder but a lot more rumbling
a FLEG!
When there is a will, there is a way. It's not really that bad there and I'm just suggesting an idea here.. maybe the aid organizations or Ham\*s could also consider delivering it into Gaza.
Yeah exactly.Dude probably had no clue, everyone else tho, was expecting for it.It's tragic really.
As soon as I saw his beard I'm like Palestinian youth?? üòÇ
It's almost like the title of the post is designed to invoke sympathy for the side in the wrong!
I'm just suggesting here.. maybe the aid organizations or Ham\*s could also consider delivering it into Gaza.
If he is shit in the artery he is most certainly dead, my roommate got shot in his during a home invasion, he barely survived but the amount of blood was crazy, and that guy seemed to be losing a lot of blood.
So you know for a fact no carpet bombing or bombing with mass casualties is taking place ? The real problem is people in the combat footage subreddits hungry for blood because the media told them to be.
What a fucking idiot. IDF soldiers have helmets but that won't help when the front part has no cover and you're facing the brick straight to your face. It would cave your skull in. Fucked around and found out.
Underground targets üòÜ this just regular bombing
Looking at the blood flowing out of his leg he did win.
There are actually towns in America where there are less resources than what your average Gazan (electricity, running water) has and the residents don't commit acts of mass murder on the neighboring areas. There were times in America's past where large swaths of areas has less, and the residents also didn't commit acts of mass murder.
Well deserved shot..
That's what people said about Saddam's mobile WMD lab after people pointed out that the Bin Laden Super Cave was bullshit
This is the wartime equivalent of suicide by cop.
Does it sound like distant thunder or different from that?
god, cringe
Show me a source
By us I mean kept alive, if they are alive then they are going through hell right now. In a tunnel probably in a cave behind a steel door hearing bombs drop every day.
That only means that it's going to be a 50 year comedy campaign and not a 20 year one.
That's the beauty of it - if you drop dry ice then you're deploying a solid, not a gas.&amp;#x200B;"Not our fault Hamas chose to keep their tunnels' ambient temperature above -79 degrees Celcius "
I doubt the hostages are still with us sadly
Of course the liberals thought that, their whole thing is to keep the status quo but throw in a few casual Fridays and act like they're titans of social progressiveness.
Yeah, this is as close as you get to "asking for it". I am not sure the dude knew it would happen, but everyone else did.
Where... Where Saddam?
don‚Äôt bring a slingshot to a gun show kids
Bro had every right to protect himself, good shit on scaring them off and not getting killed by the cops.

You all can keep criticizing and trolling me how much you like... won't share any practical ideas to 'reduce' injuries and deaths now üëç
Seems legit. just like Four Seasons landscaping.
Now it‚Äôs ‚Äòuse them or lose them‚Äô.
On a second look I bet the 'rescue' was more painful than being shot.
But they *want* to die as martyrs
Keep criticizing and trolling me how much y'all want... fine won't share any ideas to reduce injuries and deaths.
I have yet to find a LGTBT+ community member that doesn't support Palestine and Hamas, how ironic.
A part of Israelis certainly don't have ethnic cleansing in their itinerary, but you are kidding yourself if you think the current government doesn't have that in mind.   Not all Palestinians are Hamas, and not all Israelis are bigots, that doesn't change the situation that those two, not insignificant, parties are fucking shit up for the rest of the people in the region.  I've personally given up on caring about it to be honest, same as I have given up on US spree shootings. Both these issues have in common that the idiots rule and prevent progress from manifesting, it's absolutely tiring.
Depends, ambulances all over, if these guys are experienced and equipped they'll apply direct pressure to the artery against bone, that can stop even major arterial bleeds along with hemostatic wound packing but they'll have to apply constant pressure and then find a vascular surgeon fast.But yeah, more than likely dead.
October 7 celebrating slaughter of civilians, why no party for same today ? What‚Äôs the difference, some people celebrate civilians death should be happier than ever now .
West Bank\* edition
In my country we call this activity "s\*\*\*\*\*e by cop" and we mostly grieve for the police officer who will have to live with having killed someone.
This looks like a Hamas combatant trying to kill an IDF soldier in a war.
Not going to know unless you immediately strip the wound. Even if it is higher there‚Äôs no bleeding control at all. This dudes done

I haven't seen this much service since eating in Cancun where I had a dozen wait staff.
Develop Gaza for what? Erase Palestine from the map. No one who does not know how to live in society should be annihilated. I can't understand how they think Palestine won't ever be an enclave of Arab-sponsored terrorists. But do they still want to help the Palestinians? Children who are born with Islamic jihad inside them, mothers who encourage death. One by one, delete them from the map! #notfreepalestine
There's a sign in the background that says "Medical services." That dude is hardly a youth throwing a stone though, and he's doing so from a medical facility.
"Move to the other part of Gaza that we are also bombing."
Al Jazeera!!
Also he stand near a sign that says something about medical center for the full show if I am not mistaken. Someone can confirm?
"Attention: Fish in barrel. Please move to the other side of the barrel. We will begin shooting into the barrel immediately."It's fucking insane. 1 million people cannot move through a warzone with bombs falling all around them. Especially not when the roads keep getting hit.
Those stones can kill people and this is why they are using them.
Doesn't look good for the youngfella. That is a lot of leaking out of the leg.
The thing is that because he does not have a military uniform these dummies think he is a civilian, that is how the game is played.
You haven't been taught since preschool to murder Jews. That's the difference. https://unwatch.org/un-teachers-call-to-murder-jews-reveals-new-report/
cant you just designate every civilian as a terrorist and nuke the area? way easier and better for global petrol prices. think of the economy please.
Wait, what? I don‚Äôt give a fuck about Ukraine or Israel anymore. They changed the ore distribution in minecraft?
I‚Äôm not pro idf or pro hamas but does the sling shot not make him an active combatant? Wouldn‚Äôt this be a justified engagement?
Right here 49.416409,-1.173881. It's where the Utah Beach museum is
Post war Japan had a lot of baggage to work out.
sounds like the tagline of a biblical comedy
Wrong conflict. I mean I want US boots on the ground but Israel doesn't need the help and going after Iran doesn't make sense. You want to go for the head of the snake aka Russia so those boots would do better...in Ukraine.
Hamas: We don't have enough medical personnel on hand, equipment to use, not even enough ambulances to help the people! Also Hamas:
its long overdue, israel have been patient to endure their shitty rockets for decades, but now its time to end the shit for ever
Gaza city will be a pile of rubble, thats why israel told the civilians to leave
I was thinking the same. Very convenient to have the press and all of those medics there. It kind of looks all to good to be true...it might have been staged to the point that he wasn't shot just a bit of fake blood
And the Press suspiciously tooü§î let me guess the headline " littel Boy gets shot by IDF while playing on Container"
That‚Äôs the most adult looking child I‚Äôve ever seen.
They actually reached the point where there are too many of them and they are standing in each other's way more than actually helping.
There's a reason these things were used in wars for thousands of years. This is not simply 'throwing rocks'. These are slingers.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sling_(weapon)
Might as well consider them dead so they can be avenged fast and hard
Looks like the bleeding might be too high for a tourniquet... gg wp
Perfect example of the current situation. Palestinians attack, recieve a response and than have the cameras ready to film it so they can cry about it online
Paramedics stand by!"Innocent" civilians ready?Camera, sound, action!
All the medics and photographers were waiting for it so they can manipulate the situation to their own benefit‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs how fighting terror organizations looks like, they don‚Äôt mind putting their people in danger in order to get a good shot
That's such a bad fake puppy
Gloves off being war crimes.... You have a super fucked moral compass..
There needs to be a reconstruction, but first you remove all the death cult leaders from power. That only comes through unconditional surrender. Right that's what the allies asked in World War II. They did not ask that in World War I and we got World War II.
That's what I thought. Weird how he implied they could make a country "on top of what they had."
You read my mind my dude
This time tho Goliath has guns
We just watched a live setup snuff film. What the actual fuck
Turns out if Goliath had a gun, David wouldn't have gotten very far with his slingshot.
Not really on point when you don‚Äôt apply a tourniquet immediately to someone with an obvious arterial bleed. That dudes gonna be dead in a few mins if no one tied that shit off
Must be a Bond Villain‚Äôs lair
Fucked Around. Found Out.
Atleast 3 camera people.. 5-6 emergency crew.. Plus a few more people..Just waiting for this guy to get shot.. It looks so well planned.. They all knew that this would happen, and we will get nice pics of "unarmed" Palestinian getting shot and we will cry about it on international stage.
We broke a kid's nose at camp with one of those water balloon launchers (ages ago) .... Yes, with a water balloon! We weren:t trying to mess him up. A rock absolutely can be lethal, but not the ideal weapon to bring to a fight.
Yeah you think they would be busy pulling the 1,000‚Äôs of claimed to be injured children out of rubble right ?
rock or grenade? you dont know, you just know someone wants to do you harm, you dont want to die, so you shoot the idiot standing in the open throwing shit at you. idiots defend kid, and the propaganda machine keeps turning.
Last night was intense
I live in southern Israel, we hear the bombings being done in Gaza here, last night was insane, every 15 minutes would sound like the sky was falling, can't even imagine how it sounded over there
This is as staged as staged gets without shooting yourself in the femoral artery. Absolutely insane thought process.
And 1300 women and children non-combatants deserve to not be murdered
Shit looks like Minecraft.
That's in the west bank. Many bandages to go around there. Probably because they didn't choose a terrorist organization to run their government.
Is it like 10 paramedics per person there?
Talking about human victims CO2 suffocation is not comparable to inert gas suffocation. CO2 blood content is the most important factor impacting human respiratory effort. It takes a small amount of CO2 to cause extreme distress and it takes a huge amount to kill. You can survive Breathing air mixed with CO2 causes extreme suffering in humans. Short breath, feeling of suffocation, shallow and fast breathing with extreme effort, panic, anxiety, restlessness, feeling of dying.That will continue until victim succumbs. There used to be open licence archival EDUCATIONAL movies showing monkeys being killed this way. Looks gruesome because it is.
Maybe yes. But he stopped screaming fast and lights out when they put him down. Guy is leaking blood like a hose.
How is that terrorists in gaza have unlimited rockets but complains about having no water or electricity.
In the same UN resolution that made Israel a country.
Free real estate
guess you shouldn't bring a slingshot to a gunfight.... almost looked choreographed
it's the usual palestine MO, call the 19 year olds trying to kill soldiers with a sling "innocent children", that way the death count in the media has an easier time making you sad.
Don't forget the cameraman not missing a glimpse of the scene.It's not " staged ", but they definitely all ( except him apparently) knew exactly what was going to happen.
Slingshots are fucking serious you can literally kill with them.
That‚Äôs a war crime, son.Geneva convention specifically prohibits aspirants and deadly gases.
Shot in the ass, quite literally, With the amount of blood and the bright red color he might got shot in the illiac artery. If that's so, he's done.
Almost won a darwin award there
Sure son, stand up tall and throw some rocks at the guys with assault rifles.At this level of dumb, it‚Äôs basically natural selection.
i'm from brooklyn and i know personally a good few jews who are strongly anti-zionist. this idea that anti-zionism is anti-semitism is pure media bs and eclipses the many orthodox jews and rabbis that actively stand with palestine
Better yet - take the ~80 that died like this waste of oxygen, add onto them 3 murdered by settler terrorists, and then you can say ‚Äú80 killed by settlers and idf‚Äù, and suddenly you can claim both-sides on the whole mass terrorism issue, and never need to change your mind!
The key words are "nerve gas with low lethality", but they apparently misheard it and pumped shitloads of fentanyl instead.

No. This is Israel Land. Why you supported the Hamas. Why you Happy when your Hamas Brother kill civilians?
It literally is even written down in the Holy Bible as being the weapon that a little boy used to kill a Giant.
No, I specifically said that it's widespread through the vocal pro-Palestinian people, not that the entirety of #freepalestine people are pro-Hamas. &gt; I think the speech Guterres gave sums up what most people if not every level headed person should support.I haven't heard this speech, will google for it.
That's why you can't trust half of the videos/images coming out
Nice. One terrorist dead. Go Israel. #free Israel
 I See 3 terrorist. Go Israel Go. Kill all this terrorist. #free Israel

RemindMe! 1 month "let's see how the IDF's ground assault shakes out :)"
Dresden? Israelis are amateurs.
Free from terrorists means ejecting Hamas from Gaza. Still waiting for that to happen. Eject Hamas and renounce violence against Israelis, then Palestinians will be free.https://www.adl.org/resources/backgrounder/allegation-river-sea-palestine-will-be-free
I've seen another video of Palestinians slinging rocks at an Israel checkpoint. In the background there were paramedics on standby
That's Pallywood for you, if all those orange shirts actually cared about his health they would talk him down instead of letting him use a stone age weapon vs a modern armed military.disclaimer: both Hamas and the state Israel are shitty entities involved in a conflict with each other that only results in the suffering of innocent civilians on both sides.
1 guy with a stone, 3 photographers and 40 EMTs
Agree
*20 seconds later-  Al Jazeera "IDF shoots indiscriminately into Palestinian children kill 10 according to Gaza Authorities"- UN motions to condem Israeli genocide- Iran whines about US interface- Western cities infected with Free Palestine protests, conviently ignoring the anti-Semitic chants.
9000 bunker-rooms of Hamas
Youth? Dude looks like he is in his 20's or 30's.Also medics standing by so close by means they knew exactly what they were doing and what to expect from their action. Camera filming it from the perfect angle. They were trying to create terrorist propaganda material they can spread.And what can you say: It worked. They got exactly the pictures they wanted. Propaganda they can spread around the world, including reddit. And anyone upvoting this helps spreading their propaganda even further.
david and goliath moment
Lmao this had me bad laughing
When did Palestine have a country?
Add a sling and you get someone potentially getting hit in the face with a lethal weapon
Agreed, this is a deadly weapon, used since the ancient era. A well aimed shot would instant kill the enemy.
There is a term for this : pallywood.
9/10 if i throw a rock at someones face. The first words out their mouth are "That could have F**king killed me!?!?!".Those same people then expect Police Officers, Soldiers and security staff to just "take a rock to the face like a champ"The Mental Gymnastics hoops some people jump through are mind boggling.
This is a pretty good side view of the propaganda machine at work
Are you grouping everyone in #freepalestine as hamas sympathizers or something? My roommate is pretty pro #freepalestine and he does not believe Hamas was in any way justified. It does help to try to understand "why" a part of palestine defends Hamas actions though, dosen't mean you have to support it.I think the speech Guterres gave sums up what most people if not every level headed person should support."The grievances of the Palestinian people cannot justify the horrific attacks by Hamas. Those horrendous attacks cannot justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people."
Oh no!Anyways...
I know right? Medics on point üòÇ
Logic says if you throw stones at armed soldiers it‚Äôs not going to end well.   Therefore either he is incredibly stupid or wants to be a martyr
Still spooked by the woke Boogeyman eh?
5 emergency workers on standby so that two dudes can throw rocks at fully armed soldiers.. I don't know what to say lol
We can hate war and hate people... but still not want to see them getting wiped out.When you really think about it, the only pro-life position favours neither 'side', because both 'sides' include needless human suffering inflicted by the other.Meanwhile... am I the only one able to see the aerial photos of Gaza? Entire neighbourhoods reduced to rubble. Apparently residents will be allowed to go home after this is all over. Home where? Their homes are gone.
But they‚Äôre still mining at Y=11 because nobody there knows about the ore distribution changes
Well yeah staged in the sense they knew he was going to get shot and where waiting for it.
free from Hamas as well right?
"Carefully machined?" Student projects could do a better job than them, they make improvised weapons with relatively primitive tools. If you said their footage was recolorized from 1950 there is not much in there that could prove you wrong. "Factories" is also a big stretch of the word, from their footage it looks more like smallish workshops.
Sorry the date is 28-10-2023 it is from today
Youth? Look like 20s and 30s to me
Maybe it's just me, but if I'm in a high risk area where people are waiting for other people to get shot, I'll do my best to avoid being the casualty.
I swear so many people think this whole thing just kicked off this month when it's been going on for decades
Its their usual rhetoric.Then they'll say "IDF kill Palestinians everyday".The number of innocent civilians that get shot probably exist, but it's much, much lower than what we think it is
Leggit, the overwhelming reason why multiple sects of islam stop hating each other and work together seems to be the deadication to wiping out the jewish state.Whether you think it should've been established or not, we can't really solve the issue easily now as one side wants to genocide all the jews. So we can't take power from the jewish state. Otherwise, they would have abbsoultly no protection or powers to defend themselves from the extremely miffed muslim groups. Unfortunately, we sort of have to take a step back and let these geoups come to an arrangement on their own.
If they were pro palestine theyd be anti hamas and fighting to help their people uproot that evil.
Not good news for this guy. Don't get me wrong, I'm no doctor, so take everything I say with a grain of salt, but I've seen enough combat footage and violent street confrontations to know that if you get shot once in the leg, and 20 seconds later your whole lower half is soaked in bright red blood, there's good chance it hit the femoral, or some other major artery. Given everything that's going on in Gaza right now, I can't imagine bandages are in ample supply. There's decent odds that this guy is toast.Still, I can't imagine throwing your life away for such a futile gesture as lobbing a rock at an invading army. He was never going to make a meaningful difference either way, and now he is very possibly going to die.
These people goofy as hell.
Bro this video is legit staged, you all think that coincidentally someone gets shot and there are 10 paramedics there to help that person?
Jackass Gaza edition
Ah it's Black Mesa Research Facility lol
Definitely femoral artery
Or the maybe a little too credible way:WaterIt's heavier than air, it's cheap and the mediterranian sea is right next to Gaza.
Your argument would hold at all if the west bank didn't exist, where there is no hamas and israel is still killing people, and making illegal settlements. Also, netenyahu aka israeli gov is on record saying they prefer hamas in power because they don't want a 2 state solution. They've backed hamas for so long its not a secret.https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-20/ty-article-opinion/.premium/a-brief-history-of-the-netanyahu-hamas-alliance/0000018b-47d9-d242-abef-57ff1be90000Just hypocrisy on so many levels. And you people somehow defend this shit. Its disgusting because what you're defending in the end is the brutal slaughtering of innocents, mostly children.
Yes they were. Seeing how this is all a PR campaing, one could claim they were *hoping* for that result.
Definitely hit a artery. His pants were soaked in a deep red visible through black pants. He‚Äôs most likely dead. Looked like pelvis to groin hit. No tourniquet gonna save that
Dude nobody is on the side of Hamas, they're on the side of innocent people in both Israel and Palestine
They're called "traitors" by a bunch of Orthodox Jewish... It's really depressing.
One of the earliest weapons known to mankind. Anyone claiming it's not lethal is either lying or misinformed.
"Behemoth is enraged"
Except Isreal are the aggressors they have been slowly taking over palistinian land for over 70 years.
A supposed IDF soldier wrote that they are gonna try to find every entrance, seal them with dozens of old tires, set them ablaze and bury the tire fire with bulldozers. The tire fire is gonna suck the oxygen out of the tunnels to keep burning and produce CO2 and CO which will sink to the lower levels and kill Hamas.
Seems like wanted him to be in the news. He's more useful to them if he got hit.
They take it outside and throw it over the fences at the joos
IDF: ‚ÄúSo anyway this is why we dropped 300,000lb worth of bunker busting bombs on that apartment building.‚ÄùNcd: ‚Äúyes.‚Äù
Short air defense systems such as stingers, air to air missiles, etc.This isn't Russia, they don't have tens of thousands of these drones and Israel has air superiority. Plus Israel can focus all their air defenses in a 30km strip of land whereas in ukraine they need to spread them out for thousands of kilometers
Don't bring rock games to a gun game.
You see what happens when you FUCK A STRANGER IN THE ASS?!
You wanna use heavy gas like chlorine phosphorus, pump it in till it comes out both sides of the tunnel, and it's guaranteed to be full.....
Ah, the land must belong to Syria, then!I jest, but all I can think of are [the Libyans](https://youtu.be/AChCcVIJaCE) from Back to the Future. Substitute Libyans for Syrians. Lol
Bullshit. Zionist trying to make it negative. It's not!! "From the river, to the sea, Palestine will be FREE!!". It's about being FREE. Free from occupation, free from being murdered, Free from terrorists.
Yeah‚Ä¶.. no, don‚Äôt do that
The thing is that no one (or very few people) are *defending* what Hamas did, but the Israel side likes to pretend that's the position being held by anyone that supports Palestine. Pretty much everyone condemns Hamas for the attack - that's just inherently part of the conversation.
This is what happens when you meet a stranger in the alps
then tell me how does they protect them self agains drones
&gt;  I don't need any of that bloated CS 2 nonsense in my life.THen why are you asking for CSS and not 1.4. (Because that was the peak of CS, none of this 1.6 nonsense).
Free PalestineFrom HAMAS
So this one person launching a rock  had a photographer and a 10 person emergency medical team on standby? It‚Äôs almost as if someone knew he may be shot.
They were expecting that result!
like what? Hamas doesnt have millions of landmines scattered around gaza, maybe a handful of ATGMs and no conventional artillery. This is exactly the type of enemy an armour column is made for
This is not a near-peer conflict. Should be obvious, but apparently it is not.
I hope you know that this is one of the more peaceful forms of protest. I agree that the US gov doesn't give a fuck about Palestine, but there's only so many forms of protest that are legal. The realization that those forms are a waste of time probably isn't going to lead to an outcome you'd appreciate either.
‚ÄúComrade, what are you doing? Don‚Äôt eat up all our rations when shit bucket right there. Use your head comrade.‚Äù
i love how people are like it‚Äôs just children throwing rocks, yea let me hurl a fuckin rock with a slingshot at your face and let‚Äôs see what happens
These are indigenous tanks. US military aid for Israel is about 14% of their military budget.
russia:"We'll take Kyiv in 3 days! Oops, do we need fuel for that? Hey, why are our 20 year old Chinese tyres venting air out?! Hey, anyone has a battery charger? This one can't start!"
The front lines of what, exactly? What they're protesting is the use of their tax dollars to commit genocide. Are you confused?
guy saw 1 video of ukraine and thinks hes a general
Never gonna happen for as long as tank commanders like to look with their own eyes instead of relying entirely on periscopes and cameras.
You could have basically predicted the Ukraine invasion by watching google maps traffic at the crimean border.
Israel has been doing a genocide for many decades now. I wouldn't be surprised if whoever organized this has done a protest for this same cause in the past.
Reminds me of that one gmod mapIt was a modified version of gm_construct but had loads of tunnels
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes
Finally
A sling is a deadly weapon. Shoot and expect to get shot.
Yep, Israel has *never* heard of these "drone"-things you speak of.  They simply *cannot* counter them as they have never heard of them before this.
They have learned nothing from Ukraine
&gt; more of people refusing to condemn hamas for their murder of innocent civiliansCan you give some examples? I think you're falling for propaganda.
Pray for religious harmony
It wasn't just about the october-talks, this has planned for a long time. Its the overall trend of Israel-Arab relations that is easing tensions in the region.
Rip tank design. Unless they make tank turrets with well integrated spaced Armor on top. But I'm not sure how or if it will work.
Pray for religious harmony
A massive protest restricting movement at one of the busiest terminals in the world is literally a public freakout.
I wouldn't have this emergency response time where I live even if I would get shot in the ER room.
Do you really have to say they occupied it lol
They treat their own injured as bad as their enemies.
Scoll down to save ... realize I already had it saved;)
most clueless comment.
&gt;Even if they level every house they see, it's still super dangerous.That is the most obvious thing anyone has said about armor and urban areas in the last two decades.
This is what happens, Larry. You see, Larry?
Yeah, it's safer to just sit back and bomb indiscriminately. You kill more "collateral damage/Human shields" but at least the IDF soldiers are safe.
i think the issue is that for most people that are #freepalestine, they either refuse to condemn Hamas/October 7th without condition ("Yes, Hamas is bad BUT...", can you imagine if anyone did this justification shit after ISIS released videos?) or they outright say the attack was justified and people living in Israel are deserving of death ("there are no civilians" "Israel is a settler occupation").The above isn't localized to random nobodies online, it's pretty widespread through the vocal pro-Palestinian people. I don't really think there's something similar on the opposite end.
Hamas uses babies as human shields
I assure you every groundpounder has NV (batteries are a different story)
A human shield Hamas uses
Yeah but if it‚Äôs dry Ice then it‚Äôs not poison ‚Äúgas‚Äù more like a nice cooling solid on a hot day
Hamas using it as shield
Ah yes, the Ben Shapiro and PragerU retelling of events.
All you need is a computer printer tshirt and an iron‚Ä¶.
Ah, they don‚Äôt have helmets. That‚Äôs why so many of them are dying. Why did you wait so long to share this genius solution?
Seriously, watching the the big media channels it just all seems so staged. They exist to only to push narrative and agenda. Scripted. And outrageous. Reality TV
There photos . Hamas said it themselves.
Except it did. Hamas is not Ukraine
Only if they promise to glass Kelantan first
Liars are Hamas
Genecide
American tax dollars at work
Wait, I‚Äôve seen this before. And something tells me it‚Äôs going to play out exactly how i think it is
For 17 years right? Multiple bombing campaigns, bulldozing homes. Killing millions? Oh yeah, send out the peace doves for dear Israel
People in comments all expert tank generalsüòÉ
And then systematically cut off power food medicine and freedom of movement right? Sounds peaceful to me
Egypt will maintain peace with Israel or risk losing military support/supplies from the west. It‚Äôs why there hasn‚Äôt been a major war against Israel involving actual nations for a while.
There are multiple instances of people tearing down hostage posters, and many more of people refusing to condemn hamas for their murder of innocent civilians
very juicy tank column very easy target for made in iran drones
It should be one state not two ü§£ Palestine needs to disappear.
I think it's harder to hide 50 rockets and prepare them for launch, so they get out like 10 rockets to shoot and scoot.
The Negev was adopted in 1997, by which time the M60 was considered long obsolete. The Negev was based on the FN Minimi, which, as the M249, had already replaced the M60, along with the M240 in the US.I tought it was based on the m249 which im wrong, i remembered when they tought us they said it was based on something, sorry it was long time ago and you made me do some research, anyway i hated that gun, it was so heavy to carry with the bullets and all.
Sorry but I don't believe in a full happy ending for these columns. Even if they level every house they see, it's still super dangerous.
Course we did. Enemy of my enemy is my friend.  Philippines tried to invade, backfired horribly, and we saw an opportunity
Mfs like u are so dumb. Get out to where? The whole Gaza is being bombed. No where is safe
Would it be worth the risk of the further instability in the region? Gaza is dense, and seeing a repeat of something like Fallujah on steroids will only shed both Israeli and Palestinian blood. If Hamas gets displaced from Gaza, what‚Äôs stopping them from gaining more political influence in a place like the West Bank? It‚Äôs clear that people being bombed will only be radicalized to follow their dogma.Edit: LMAO, only on this sub will you get mass downvoted for saying war is bad. Lovely people here
But _imagine_ 30 JDAMs exploding like they‚Äôre cluster bomblets (as in, each subminition being a goddamn &gt;500lb JDAM)
And the internet has been cut, a near total media blackout. I an sure IDF soldiers will behave, right?
FAFO consequences?
Probably a hospital or primary school
I have an idea let‚Äôs park all the shit next to eachother, good thing they aren‚Äôt fighting things in the air
3000 children according to a terrorist organization that recruites children and sends them to battle at fifteen so they could say children have died. Check the dead children age percentage and you'll be surprised. Besides that they had 3 weeks to move litteraly 4 kilometers to the south.If they didn't do that they are stupid, or Hammas is forcing them to stay there - which is their fault and responsibility.
I wanted to learn more about the conflict and came across this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lv1SpwwJEW8). How accurate is this?
Look at this big wazu over here being all reasonable and shit. Keep it up.
Feel like you're missing the mark if that's what you're getting from these protests. It's not like these people are protesting for Hamas to keep hostages.
Say that to the 3,000 children. Muppet.
Netanyahu propped Hamas up for years as well. They were useful for him. Both sides are paying a price. And it 'has been tried' is such a poor argument. The conflict in Northern Ireland would have never been resolved had people been constantly been thinking "but we already tried this"
To the other side, the side of Gaza, away from tunnels and the hamas terrorists.
For sure. Many monsters died in Gaza that night. Many sadistic, disgusting, brutal and cruel terrorists.
Like using depleted uranium is nuclear warfare
The kind of genocide where you tell people to move out 4 kilometers to their south 3 weeks in advance to not get hit...Unlike massacaring, burning alive, torturing, raping, mutilating and kidnapping in a surprise attack. That's genocide, and to that you answer with force.
Hamas has been a thing since the 80s, and will continue to be a thing as long as it receives support from nations like Iran &amp; Russia. Unsurprisingly, guerilla groups are hard to get rid of, even harder if they‚Äôre well-funded and their leaders are openly operating from foreign countries.It can also be argued that Hamas grew to its extent in the past with the help of covert Israeli support to weaken secular Palestinian political parties. I don‚Äôt know how this conflict will be resolved, but the more than 3,000 dead children since the 9th is not a sign that things are going well.
As a Malaysian,I'm so embarrassed by this stupid ass propaganda
Hamas used drones.
Yep, the American Indians killed off their predecessors and took the land. Just as those people killed their predecessors and took their land. Shouldn‚Äôt be a surprise that human nature hasn‚Äôt changed since the days of more than two people existing in the same area.
Are night time raids possibly Israelis long term strategy here?Almost every single vehicle on that video has thermal or night vision capability for driver, gunner and commander. The air assets such as drones, apaches and fighter jets all have that capability as well as being all networked together with infantry and vehicles through some proprietary system they developed which I forgot the name of.The infantry most likely doesn't have enough of night vision vision for everyone, but I assume much more than in 2014.At night, most of the civilians that are still in the area would be inside, meaning any Hamas militant near the contact line would stand out like a Christmas tree on thermals. As well as any kind of movement deeper in the city for either vehicles or militants that are moving anywhere.And a huge advantage would be in the fight against drones, since most of the smaller DJI types for recon or dropping smaller grenades won't have any thermal capability, and neither are the $10,000 heavy payload drones that can carry standard rpg HEAT or tandem warheads guaranteed to have thermals. This would overall almost nullify most of the drones effect.
It would be pretty funny to do that just to fuck with people.
In the Ukraine war, Russia introduced them to protect against top down munitions like Javelins at which the cope cage failed spectacularly.The IDF cope cage seems designed to stop Hamas dropping a grenade into the top hatch.
I thinl it would be easier to pave the surface, I dont think its a solution, but it is easier than emtying the tunnels.
Yup, and pizza is good, too. Free pizza is debatably the best.
Some terrible spelling mistakes in that link. It's actually Ouistreham and the canal is Canal du Caen (Caen is the city nearby)
if it makes you feel any better, and it obviously will not, people are exploiting this as an excuse to attack jews pretty much worldwide. we seem to be stuck in this weird moment where a lot of people who actually are deeply antisemitic feel very comfortable hating jews by aligning and hiding behind people with very legitimate criticisms of the israeli government. *but the latter group is almost completely fucking blind to the presence of jew-haters in their ranks*.
Rough transcript: Pilot: I'm 7 mile from it, height 5, I'm descending to altitude 7(Leader?): Descend and move to identification positionPilot: Going to identification, medium speed, 300 knotsLeader: AcknowledgedLeader: Proceeding south if I mayPilot: Visual contact with an object, 1.5 mile, permission to fireLeader: FireI couldn't really make what the third person was saying from 0:30 onwards.Finally the leader again is heard saying "Proceeding south"
Cope cages
Smuggling tunnels aren't the same as command and control bunkers and underground bomb factories.
And the Israeli PM that took over after Rabin unilaterally withdrew from Gaza to continue working with the Palestinians for peace.If Hamas hadn't taken over there would be peace in the Middle East.
Probably using a literal potato too
"Irish" bar.
At the time Hamas was seen as perhaps more moderate and someone you wanted to support since they seemed focused on community work.

You served in the IDF and you don't know the Negev is not an M249 but an original IWI weapon? M249 has open bolt system, Negev has dual system (open and closed, based on operator setting). Different fire selector. Different feeding mechanisms (the Negev can accept STANAG magazines). Different barrel changing mechanisms and well, different barrels (same caliber though). Negev has better fire rate and weights slightly less than the M249.Totally different weapon.
70 year old tunnel rats coming out of retirement one last time
Iran stoked the flames to prevent Israeli and Saudi Arabian normalization talks that were literally just about to happen until the October attacks paused them.  This isn't just Israel and Palestine.  There's a lot more going on behind the scenes and it's all bad news
They evolved from a common ancestor, therefore I declare it so.
West bank has palestinians and isrealians And ruled by isrealAnd the only ones killed are palestinians And no hamas have no relation with themAnd hamas also are different from the government in gaza (the ones palestinians has)
Never seen it put so reasonably in so few words
Looks like they took some quick drone cage lessons from the Ukrainian war
Wish I could see what happened after
fascist
I'm really excited to see **America's** reconstruction plans for **Iraq** after it destroys **Sadam**. Not even sarcastic. I think post WWII shows what reconstruction can do when well funded. I think post WWI shows what happens when reconstruction isn't a priority. Really hoping for a well funded reconstruction. All parties involved would benefit.Just framing how ridiculous this whole situation is.
Did Hamas released proof of life for every hostage they had? Hamas lied about the hospital bombing, they even release a video faking an injured child being rushed to emergency, using a doll. Problem is that people trust so much what Hamas says. They are terrorists, they are vile.  I hope that Israel and allies get more of the hostages out of Gaza, but I don't believe 250 hostages were taken alive, at all. I also hope innocent Palestinians (not Hamas or it's supporters), get out of the north of Gaza.
Hamas are not in West Bank Still people in Palestine are still killedWhat are the reasons ?!!
The Israeli peacemakers were butchered and burned alive, others were kidnapped.
Get this in ready or not
They were living decently peacefully before the war started. The biggest issue is not the Jews, it‚Äôs Hamas.
The assets where easily avalible. Wouldnt you also just use that?
Malaysia boleh üíÄ
I didn‚Äôt say anything other than thatThey either go back from where they cameOr find a way to live in peace with palestinians without killing them every now and then to take more lands
Jews are a people as well. Also, when we‚Äôre the Palestinians there? Because historically the Jews were there  way before they were.
the only two countries that have blocked the UN proposed two state solution are the US and ISrael.
That will not happen with Hamas in power.
no, they haven't. The only countries that have stood in the way of the UN agreed two state settlement is Israel and the US.
Anything is chemical warfare.You shot a guy in the throat? That's chemical warfare as you are suffocating him causing his blood to be dilluted in CO2.You used an artillery? That's a chemical warfare as the residue from the shell remains could endanger the health of anyone in the vicinity.
They told everyone to go to the south and they are also bombing the south, including the refugee camps.
It‚Äôs like Northern Ireland on steroids. Almost twice as many have died in the past three weeks as the total casualty count over the 30 years of the Troubles. I can‚Äôt see a resolution. Where are the peacemakers?
To be honest, it was really loud last night.. something was different, our windows were rattling and we live ~20km away.
Sharpton styles race hustlers. https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/understanding-the-hamas-net-worth/ar-AA1ivwb7
They didn't withdraw for voting. They voted abstained because the resolution didn't add Hamas as terrorists or anything about the hostages taken that would secure their wellbeing or release. Only "pls ceasefire". While conveniently forgetting that Hamas actually broke the previous ceasefire on the 7th of October.
Iran isn't arab lol
Palestine is a country Not a religion to start withAnd they are the people of the landNot Israeli‚ÄôsIf u tell them to leave their land, where are the supposed to go?And who will accept them ?!
Who's the moron filming instead of taking shelter?If only there was some sort of Award for this kind of behaviorü§î
So if there are Palestinians in other parts of the world why do they need land? Ask your question from both sides.
Why do u make things about religion There are jews in morocco, yemen and other countries Why to steal one? They came to Palestine fas refugees and they accepted them Years later, they killed Palestine and put the rest in gaza as prisoners with no airport or way out.
Yeah, wonder if that would be seen as chemical warfare. Say ‚Äúgas‚Äù and people get twitchy.
There are 52 Muslim states and 1 Jewish state. By saying that the 1 Jewish state does not deserve its land is anti semetic.

Quit acting like this wasn‚Äôt started by Gaza. This could have been settled peacefully so there‚Äôs no excuse.
Hamas themselves say they have deep tunnels everywhere. This is not even a secret.
The source is a reporter working with UNRWA US in Gaza. This reporter is now also working as rescuer because of the very crazy amount of people killed in gaza by isreal.The reporter name is Motaz_azaiza.The babies names are shared too. So stop ur f***ing lies Be a human and admit it
&gt;DID Israel just start decimating Gaza for no reason.Damn! i love what you just said in black and white. Nothing but the truth
The source is a person (posing as media) holding two very injured &amp; bleeding babies to take photos of them for social media instead is getting them medical attention. That‚Äôs your source? Really?
Everyone in here coming up with super elaborate plans to flood or gas the tunnels when a bunch of rocks on the hatches is all you need. Hospital can even keep operating, just go around the rocks and ignore the frantic banging from below.
Lmao, no. Egyptians would openly revolt if Israel was being buddy buddy to Israel during what's happening to Gaza right now. The entire country is on the edge of civil war and Sisi is barely keeping the pro-war with Israel factions in the military in place currently.
Damn rip Rachel
These people would kill me and enslave my family in the name of Islam. I‚Äôll sleep fine. How do you reasonably respond to unreasonable Jihad? Unreasonably.

For real Put everything u believe asideDo ur own unbiased research Check accounts of the reporters that are living in isreal and in Palestine And then judge
Was watching an Aussie journalist stream it from the north. He noted that last nights activities were the largest thus far, I do hope we see some tank footage released soon as they did have the merkavas active last night and we saw them firing from a distance. Willy Oam on YT if you are curious to see said stream.
Because ur lyingAnd that‚Äôs what liars doJustify their lies with other lies
Just like how it was an hamas misfire but also it was a legitimate target
The bright side is that he won‚Äôt be living in a disgusting cruel world
I‚Äôll wait for other people to notice. There are sooo many children that Hamas killed or abducted, I‚Äôm having trouble finding the photo I saw of him with his mom &amp; brother!
Even isreal denied this shitCheck here the picture that it was photoshopped fromhttps://www.instagram.com/p/CyYFXrAOh16/?img_index=1
I‚Äôm not lying. It‚Äôs shameful that Hamas would go to such lengths to try to get sympathy. Injuring one of the infant hostages! You should be ashamed for posting this with that title. How low can you sink?
These munitions seem bigger than previous ones. Hard to tell due to the video quality.
Hamas launched 2,200 rocket at 6.30am on Saturday October 7th, overwhelming iron dome and sending Israeli border troops to bomb shelters as Hamas stormed the border. They don't have this capability any more.
And don‚Äôt tell me to look up and all this bullshit.Send a legit resource. As I mentioned clearly the reporter of the picture account.And yeah ur the only one who said u recognized the pic
I used to pick up dead bodies for a living. My father was also a homicide detective for many years. We both agreed there‚Äôs no way those aren‚Äôt human.

dawg that invasion was NOT planned by a small group, that invasion was far too coordinated to be a simple "lets go bomb tel-aviv or something", like invasions require preparation, supply routes, planning, revising plans, informing units of what to do, and when to do it - it is simply not possible to not catch such a large uptick of movement of men, material, and information.
The bright side is that he or she won't have to worry about being a conflicted terrorist later in life.

I'm aware of that. There's internet at South available from Egyptian towers. There will be footage in time.
That was a fake new Someone photoshopped a picture of puppies and said they are babies stolen by hamas and burned Dump people only believed itEven nitinyaho said that the new was fake And u can google now whatever resource u want to check
And give any proof that there is a single baby abducted from Isreal in gazaI just checked isreal statistics There aren‚Äôt any babies killed/abducted
We know that Hamas beheaded and also burned many babies when they terrorized Israel on October 7th, but we also know that babies were among the many child hostages stolen by Hamas from Israel.
Can I get a Rock and Stone?
Rock and Stone.
If ur not lying then give a proof
I clearly stated the source of the picture, the reporter who took the video and his page
Give a single proofOr shut the f*** up
No babe should be abducted But to clarify something No babies from Isreal were abducted Not even oneSo use ur brain, do ur search, ask people living thereWithout research it is better if you shut
No, that baby was one of the hostages abducted by Hamas from Israel. They took his mother &amp; sibling as well.
Sadly yes
[sauce](https://youtu.be/ovIB42H0i48)
&gt;There's probably gonna be some footage from Palestinians, so we'd then could speculate more.The entire Gaza strip from north to south have been under a complete blackout for about 12 hours now. No NGOs, media agencies or the UN can get any call or message in or out. Deploying some sort of signal jammer.More than likely we are not going to be seeing anything from their end anytime soon

It has nothing to do with what you saying. Opsec is important, of course. But what you linked is specifically list of the fallen, and has nothing to do with opsec. The way it works in Israel, is KIA announced only when next of kin is formally informed (in person) by ◊ß◊¶◊ô◊ü ◊î◊†◊§◊í◊¢◊ô◊ù (Casualty notification officer). It's to not worry families who has their sons/daughters currently deployed.As for the videos, everyone can forget about Ukraine-like videos from the battlefield from IDF. There will be leaks in time, but all the official footage from operation is vetted before release, so we'll likely see very little, compared to Ukraine war. All the speculation on high or low losses so far is just this - speculation.There's probably gonna be some footage from Palestinians, so we'd then could speculate more.
He is Palestinian Stop lying You can find him in the page of @motaz_azaiza And there isn‚Äôt any babies abducted from Isreal

This is NCD, so we need to be spicier than that. I suggest nickel carbonyl. It displaces oxygen like CO2, it's also doubly toxic in that inhalation causes both CO poisoning and heavy metal poisoning, finally it's explosive in the presence of moderate heat sources and leaves behind carcinogenic byproducts.
Bro, a bunch of poor people in a desert who happen to be vulnerable to political radicalization and are trapped for their entire lifetimes within an ideologically extreme nationalistic and religiously zealous country that is trapped within another much more powerful and extremely nationalistic and religiously zealous country are definitely NOT ‚Äúthe biggest threat to the world for decades.‚Äù
The kinetic force alone will probably lead to the building being condemned and having to be torn down for rebuilding. That has to put serious strain on the rebar.
Except this time, the ocean is close enough to pump sea water into the tunnels
No, CIVILIANS will pay several fold
Yes, Hamas very quickly runs busses full of kids under Israeli bombs the minute they leave the bomber. they have whole fields full of busses with kids on them to run under the bombs.The mental gymnastics some people do to justify Israel dropping bombs indiscriminately is why they're losing this PR battle. You can't even acknowledge for a second that Israel might have some agency regarding where their bombs go lmao.
Might have been the Vice doc on youtube? I remember seeing a lathe turning a.. like a.. fuckin rocket-jawn or some shit idk. But it was there.
*bomb the 200 hostages?
Haha, I'm an outsider as well. Some limited experience playing CS 1.4 I think in software mode at 640x480 on school computers (textures with raw pixels measuring a square meter each and frame rates in the mid teens), a bit on LAN parties, maybe two hours total of playtime online since spread across 1.6, CSS and Go. I briefly tried Go 2.0, got annoyed by all of the nonsense within 15 minutes and installed CSS just for some matches against bots, which are honestly quite fun for a few minutes at a time.
Might not be much to release if the IDF collaspes the wrong tunnels.
what are they doing in the Minecraft dungeon üíÄ
Yeah seawater is probably to credible
If you can use your imagination to conjure up empathy for Palestinian people and the situation they've been in for 75 years you would understand why a group like Hamas would first of all exist and secondly why they would embark on a suicide mission.If every part of your home was systemically taken from you piecemeal over 75 years and confined you to just the bathroom then started blocking food, blocking anyone from trying to talk to you, turned off the lights randomly, won't let you shit in your own toilet, and everyone in the neighborhood applauded the guy who took your whole house and gave him every single tool they had available to keep you locked in the bathroom what would you do to that guy? Would you also be nihilistic and wish death on him? Wouldn't you smash your hands trying to break that door down just to spit in that guy's face?
People seem to forget that these tunnels have bulkheads, and that the sediment is porous. It actually does \*drain\* and thanks to how dry the sediment is, you need to flood these tunnels with the sea for probably a good amount of time (and let's face it, I don't think the Israeli's have a tactical bendy straw powerful enough to meet the volume demands). Pouring liquid petrol into the holes is not much more effective than the water and other harebrained approaches people have been trying for almost two decades against Hamas. You might manage to catch a few guys, but they'll start smelling gas and batten down the hatches. A few folks have talked about this from a couple of perspectives and it's like: good luck finding every entrance, every ventilation shaft, and every hold out.Israel is looking at possibly decades of rooting Hamas out of their tunnels. Vundervaffe of all kinds are being thrown at the problem but this is a very difficult to solve issue because of the raw density of the equation. You thought Termites were hard to get out once rooted properly? Imagine what well supplied insurgents with 30 years of supplies for 30 dudes every few 100 cubic meters is gonna be like to push against. It is not *impossible*, but it is something that is engineered to make *a government* uncomfortable as the will to fight drains.My suggestion is Israel dumps millions of rats into the tunnels. Every month. Just breed a load of rats, drop them in, close up the top. Mark every 100 or so rats, that way when they get up to the surface you can identify vents and crawl spaces -- not dissimilar to tracking a wasp or bee nest using flour and honey. The rats are incredibly frustrating to deal with, they get into food supplies, they bite people and transmit disease, and let's face it they are filthy. Unlike these other solutions, the organic problem solving of rats has multiple outcomes of convenience. Cry havok, and release the Vermintide.
May the Israeli soldiers be safe and successful in their mission. Godspeed!
The shepherd and the wolf don‚Äôt need approval from the sheep
Was that a radar guided missile? At that range? I can‚Äôt see the symbology and the pilot doesn‚Äôt seem to announce Fox 1 or Fox 2 unless he used some Hebrew code for a launch. Interesting symbology: the square box is the radar, the caret under that box is ‚Ä¶ ? In range? The circle for the seeker head on the missile tells me it‚Äôs a heat seeker but I don‚Äôt know for certain. Israel makes some very good A2A missiles that can be fired with a big off-bore angle. Don‚Äôt hear the growl I would associate with the AIM-9. Do hear a lot of communications, at least 3 voices. They (the Israelis) tend to communicate a lot! Would love to see a transcript.
I believe that was the bathroom the rocket hit.  So they now have an excuse to remodel it now. I wonder if they will go with a walk-in shower this time...
He could flip it around like, "You want to support your cause? Put your own signs up right next to these. Anybody messes with your signs, we'll beat the shit out of them, too."
It really sums up NYC in one person. Don't bother other people and you won't be bothered. No one cares who you are or what you believe as long as you don't fuck with others
If you go back like 5 days I think it was they had an ambush on the southern border. Lost a few troops and a couple tanks. You can see the troop losses but there's no where that the videos or detailed information of what equipment was lost was provided.Only thing that was mentioned was there was an attack in the south and then they updated the page for troop deaths. No other information provided. Not even who the attacking party actually was.Opsec is important after all.My whole point is Israel is not putting any of their losses out on blast. Which is really smart. So we're not going to see videos coming out of Israel in which they are taking heavy losses. They're not trying to let everybody in the region know for good reason.
Genuinely can't tell if you are serious
I use OperaGX, I've noticed the website has English options but don't know the directory to get to that page in English.

FYI  there are also some regular strikes here, not against underground targets
Mosab Hassam Yousef has an incredible story. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mosab_Hassan_Yousef
I think I've collectively played about ten minutes of Counterstrike in my life (at a LAN center in high school) despite playing thousands of hours of FPS games of all sorts in that time, CS was just not my thingSo as an entirely outside observer to this whole thing, I find it hilarious not only that the CS community is reliving a 1:1 copy of the CSS launch with CS2, but also that they seem to have no self awareness of the fact that it's happening.Maybe the current community is just young enough that they don't remember, but holy fuck it's like a bot is taking comments from message boards circa 2005 and doing a find/replace of CSS/CS2 and then posting them on Reddit.
But they're literally bombing the south?
Hebrew*You either have to translate it with your browser translator or your phone native translator. That technology is basically pre-installed on most browsers and phones now.Like when I open the link in Chrome it asks if I want to translate it in English or have it in Hebrew.

I never said it was only October 7th deaths. The page started on October 7th. It's a list of KIA in this war. I'm saying it has nothing to do with their silence on the operation. I don't understand why you mentioned it in reply to op.
Dude it would be easier to say fruity rudy played himself in that movie.
The Houthis money, weapons, logistics support and orders come from Iran. Iran has oil. Which it sells (often illegally) for hard currency, which it uses to buy weapons or buy the rights to manufacture weapons, which are then provided to Hamas, Hezbollah, Houthi and others.
Can you provide this link in English? 99% of the people in this sub don't read and write Yiddish.
Those aren't just soldiers that have died on October 7th. They update that page whenever there are current troop losses. You scroll down you would see that it signifies that they have fallen on different days. If you would search for the 26th you see which ones they have lost in the Gaza incursion &gt; Moshe Ben HaroshThe Nahal BrigadeFell on the 11th day of Hashon Tashpad (October 26, 2023)He was the most recent one added. As they are identified they are posted to the public.You all really need to stay up to date outside of the sub. You look really ignorant when you show yourselves to lack the ability to source factual Israeli information they provide to the public. Across multiple channels and platforms
NCD enlightenment, I believe is what you meant
lmao, come on
Or when they're "detonating the largest bomb in Britain since the second world war." Was reading about the Manchester bombing which was apparently 1500lb of explosive shoved in the back of a truck and managed to delete a large portion of downtown Manchester. 0 fatalities.

So, according to UN, they call it Apartheid due to the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian territories, so what? What's your point? Are you going to say that ALL Palestinians are always victims and they're ALL innocent people?
Wasnt before or you just didn't know ? That conflict has been going fore more than 16 years and it's not the first time Israel is trying to level down Gaza.It'll be the second time Israel tries (maybe) a land assault on Gaza but clearly not the first they bomb extensively Gaza after a major terrorist attack.People care now because it's another 'minority getting oppressed by a Western backed nation'.Myanmar is in a civil war nobody cares, Yemen war has been going on for years nobody cares, there's whole lot of conflicts going on but this one is important because it paints the West badly.

This IDF deaths page is there from October 7th. This is a list of ◊ó◊ú◊ú◊ô◊ù (Fallen) with name, rank and date of death. Has nothing to do with their silence on operation.
Islamic societies have had a long history of pogroms and genocides, all justified as a struggle for Jihad. The founding of Medina occurred after the total genocide of its Jewish inhabitants (justified as punishment conducted according to existing Jewish law).The establishment of Israel and the takeover of Jerusalem by the State of Israel has left a massive gaping wound across the Islamic world, still coping from the abolishment of the Caliphate (which has held a position of exaggerated importance and a complete erasure of their failures).
Last I heard that doesn't happen anymore. Because of the Pizza Meter thing. They put a lid on it.
Entirely likely that this baby was one of the Israeli hostages they abducted. I would not put it past Hamas to kill an infant deliberately to garner sympathy on social media.
This is a famously hilarious photo tbf. They‚Äôre not so funny when they‚Äôre kicking in your door at night to shoot your kneecaps out for a minor infraction.
Probably, I doubt they did it in-house
South
Isreal is killing alot of babies you mean
i mean the government agency making this PR probably hired this out to a very similar company to the ones that make gaming art
Hamas seems to kill a lot of babies!
Good strategy, just do it once you account for all hostages
People keeping roosters in a city? No wonder Palestinians are so pissy  Those birds need to be neutralized.
Ok, so the US government is out of the question then.
Have you been over to r/CombatFootage and seen Iraqi forces using fire to clear isis tunnels?
I don‚Äôt ever recall Israel firing rockets into Gaza or the West Bank. I don‚Äôt ever recall Israel sending over suicide bombers into Gaza or the West Bank. Palestine indoctrinated children at a young age to become evil adults with nothing but hate towards Jews. These children were hitting, kicking, and spitting on the deceased and hostages Hamas brought back with them into Gaza after their attack on October 7th. These same ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù Palestine adults and children were also celebrating in the streets when thousands of Americans were killed on September 11th 2001. Israel has progressed which is why there is a high Palestine population living in their territory and they have Palestinians with government positions in Israel. Even Egypt is refusing to allow them safe passage into their country because of the evil history of their people. They‚Äôve been plenty of chances to get their stuff together and they‚Äôve failed at every turn. At this point they need to be exterminated so future generations will have a safer place to live.
The IDF always updates their telegram feed with current battle actions. They were stone cold silent the entire time and then they recently posted an update on IDF deaths with no other info provided&gt;IDF: Attached is a link of the IDF website, where further updates on the fallen soldiers have been published: https://www.idf.il/59780Use your native browser or phone translator to converted from Hebrew to English if needed. These are not just deaths from October 7th. These are daily updates of current losses. Their dates of deaths are posted next to their picture. The most recent one is&gt; Moshe Ben HaroshThe Nahal BrigadeFell on the 11th day of Hashon Tashpad (October 26, 2023)Currently they are pushing on the outskirts of Beit Hanoun camp the hardest. North end of Gaza on the inland side. But they have taken losses and haven't actually breached the camp yet.https://twitter.com/NILEALERTS/status/1718112414678340093?t=NLMcwmmsOnC2idS8macIKA&amp;s=19https://twitter.com/NILEALERTS/status/1718112135337607464?t=DTgcLZpIGBylpKYQb80Uhw&amp;s=19Without regard to the source I'm just using that map and infographic to highlight where the incursions are currently taking place. Not whether or not any updates to the battlefield are correct.
Additionally, the Malay Muslims, despite owning most of the wealth of the nation, and having enshrined constitutional positions, disproportionately represented in parliament, in the public sector and given major housing benefits still perceive the ethnic Chinese as akin to Jews, who run the economy, sponsor corrupt politicians, and promote western degeneracy like alcohol and vice. The antisemitism is essentially a projection for sinophobia.
Fuck you, ok fine
I know this is NCD but fuck, what do you even do about it at that point? Bombing and not bombing are both shit options.
True to that! I agree with him, buy that man a beer üçª
More likely Hamas murdered them and blamed israel
Yasser Arafat used his people as human sacrifices all the time and we gave him the Nobel peace prize
Ahhh I think there was a fair amount of bear poking, bear baiting, and bear-keeping-in-cages-aka-occupied-territories on all sides.
That first strike was fking awsome.. It looked like the pyrotechnics at a Mettallica concert... except much larger
too dangerous for people, so autonomous crawling snake robot is the logical choice.  just like mother nature does it.  we're all just waiting for the tunnel busters to figure it out.
The other choice is what the isrealies were doing to Palestinian water wells: Fill them with concrete.  You plug the end. Or you cap the tunnel and form set concrete forms around the cap and pour concrete. the temp cap holds the tunnel shut until the concrete sets and forms a permanent cap if someone tries to break out in the mean time, they are buried in wet concrete.
Like I said, very discreet. Its mostly individual donations that fund these insurgencies and the government just lets it happen.
The frenzy has begun. We're out of time
I can just picture the driver laughing at the van thinking the two bozos were still inside it. And suddenly he feels something pressing up against the back of his head.
The left has a really weird paradoxical boner for Muslims. It comes to the surface from time to time but it's really erupted because of recent events.
The other way to handle it is how NYC deals with its rat populations in tunnels: Dry ice, and lots of it. CO2 is denser than air and will settle in caves. So dropping in a couple tons of dry ice into every tunnel entrance they find will have an immediate effect. Plus you can't smell it. Yes, it is a gruesome way to die. Asphyxiation due to Oxygen displacement due to CO2.
The 24/7 surveillance wasn't activated till after the Terrorist attack. They normally didnt operate in the Gazan skies.The hostages were taken underground. It doesn't matter what door they went in. They were coming out another. Everything you said is ignorantl to the reality on the ground.

I know right! Had their own people never poked the bear for the 1,000th time they have all of their appendages attached to them at this very moment. I‚Äôm sure once this is all said and done and Israel eradicates the instigators it will keep future generations safe.
IDF has been silent for nearly 12 hours, which is rare during this war. This sub will be bombarded with clips in the following 1-2 days.
I'm not saying you can't do some pretty cool tunneling, but everything we've seen of their tunnels points to them not having access to the amount of heavy machinery required for something like what the US military can do.

The more I see this stuff the more I am convinced that Hamas and Palestine are indistinguishable.
Fantastic! All them little baby parts ‚Äî little baby arms and legs flying every which way! Keep kickin‚Äô ass!

There are 48 Muslim nations in the world, yet the mere existence of a tiny Jewish state breaks the collective minds of the majority of Muslims. If that's not antisemitism, then I don't know what is.

My grandfather also flew the P38 over the D-Day invasion. Stationed at Wattisham by chance? 479th fighter group?
Man, has balls but he probably got robbed after getting out of the van. That was a mistake.
The fuse solution.  Looks like they could have done better.
also u believe that 40 babies were beheaded. tell me more lies that even the white house made Biden looks like a liar . wt else you believe too
That 24/7 surveillance sure would have come in handy when the hostages were taken. They had no idea where they were kept
And onsite cremation right.  So if a patient tragically passed away from suicide just burn the remains and type up a report.  Must have hung themselves, what gunshots whoever said there were shots.
Stop with the cynicalism
Rockets were being shot into Israel for a full 5 years before the disengagement. It was literally a ploy to give Hamas control of Gaza.

Guy was the one that initiated it to begin with. He is either incompetent and didn‚Äôt expect it to pan out like this or this was his agenda all along. A program like this poorly executed will only further promote anti semitism instead of empathy. He says the goal is to promote empathy but hasn‚Äôt never condemned Hamas‚Äôs ‚Äúspecial military operations‚Äù across the border, the Israeli civilians are fair game to him.
100% Utah Beach. As someone who's been to Normandie more than 10x's. I've studied these aerial maps over the years. Looks at the road network. Utah's is more grid-like vs Sword and definitely more sand dunes. If you look closely, you can see the famous beach-wall on Utah.
It's horrible that someone seemingly feels the need to remind people that the 200 hostages of terrorists are "more than just Jews" ooof.  I feel like I've accidentally fallen into a time machine.
The truth isn‚Äôt whatever you want it to be my guy.
That's true but also wrong at the same time...Israel already tried the political avenue, and Gazans elected Hamas as their leadership. Tons of money, equipment, and much more were given to Gaza, but they've used it for building tunnels and rockets.So, instead of developing Gaza and making it a beautiful place to live, they made it a terror nest. Now they just pay the price for it... Sad, but you reap what you sow.
This is Utah
None of this is true. IDF is liberating Palestinians from their true enemy, they need to realize this. Join Israel and leave that death cult behind. That is their only hope.
Just do something Check in snap the peoples stories in tel avivU will see how stable they areOn the other hand it is not possible to see anyone from gaza posting in snap todayCuz they don‚Äôt have even internet All u can see is posts and videos of masscarras from past days in insta and unbiased news
Does anyone know how much these videos are made to look worse than they really are?  I imagine the IDF and whoever makes this aircraft don't want it known how well everything actually works.  I assume the video reviewed by the IDF internally is better, but how much?
Israel isn‚Äôt a settler colonial state (it‚Äôs also not fascist either) because we Jews are literally from the region. We aren‚Äôt Europeans but middle easterners and always have been
People in Palestine now are with no aid, no electricity, no internet and not even clean water.They are in a complete prison oppressed
7,028 Palestinians, including 2,913 minors were killed just in the past two weeks.Not a single baby was killed in IsrealAll they could just fake a photoshop image and then they say it was a mistake by photoshop
That‚Äôs probably more likely
Google knows a place is busy, or there is a lot of traffic, by basicslly seeing how many people are in the vicinity (if they have location on, and allow tracking) at least that's the explanation I've heard, I could be totally wrong idk. But basically that's why it shows that the pizza place is busy, there's just more people in the vicinity than normal, I don't think there's actually a ton of officers and staff getting pizza lol
Not trying to start a debate just curious what the community here thinks.  Ukraine has taught us that when something goes well there's somehow magically a camera filming it from a drone.  I can't help but shake the thought that since there's no drone footage that something isn't lining up.  Has anyone seen drone footage published?  The NYT and Al Jazeera both published stories showing that one feed we all saw wasn't it.  I can't imagine it wasn't filmed.  Maybe I just missed it?
That and the Speaker literally suggested US boots on the ground
Maybe they just wanted Gazans to obverse Shabbat
Your comment about having that illusion reminded me of a passage in Dostoevky's The Idiot: *To kill for murder is a punishment incomparably worse than the crime itself. Murder by legal sentence is immeasurably more terrible than murder by brigands. Anyone murdered by brigands, whose throat is cut at night in a wood, or something of that sort, must surely hope to escape till the very last minute. There have been instances when a man has still hoped for escape, running or begging for mercy after his throat was cut. But in the other case all that last hope, which makes dying ten times as easy, is taken away for certain. There is the sentence, and the whole awful torture lies in the fact that there is certainly no escape, and there is no torture in the world more terrible.*
I wouldn‚Äôt mind it. Beats being a vampire. At least werewolves can be kosher
I'm really excited to see Israel's reconstruction plans for Gaza after it destroys Hamas.  Not even sarcastic. I think post WWII shows what reconstruction can do when well funded.  I think post WWI shows what happens when reconstruction isn't a priority.  Really hoping for a well funded reconstruction.  All parties involved would benefit.
You found it on the net. . It must be true lol
This is just renaissance-era counter-mining tactics with modern hardware.
So what generals get a bunch of pizza then?
Anderson Cooper does an episode on the day of the attack streaming on Max
It‚Äôs a time honored tradition for the Israelis to use the sea to drown the people trying to kill them.
Well this video just proves it to me, idk about you all
New Yorkers are the fucking best
Jihadists!  Roll out!!
Look up the Selinsgrove Center. It is the State facility for the mentally R.Not only had an onsite hospital, but full working farm and dozens of huge buildings, including a wooded retreat.All connected by under ground tunnels.
Let's say I do deep throat the IDF boot..Now what?I still get to sit here and laugh as they systematically destroy Hamas and anyone who stands in their way. You still sit here and cry about it. Why cope?
yeah but it is still considered rare to today's standard even if it is a patrol boat or a corvette engaging a small boat
Samo old same old unfortunately - tribalism, a fundamental basic instinct of humanity. Just that most others seem to keep it under wraps - not here, we fly our tribalism on public lampposts, fucking mental.

Sadly, I think that was the Nord-Ost siege -- theater in Moscow.  Killed a lot of hostages.The Beslan school siege the Russians used precise fire and highly-coordinated tactics to... wait, nevermind, they fired a bunch of thermobaric RPGs into the building and wiped out 1/3 of the hostages in the crossfire.  Pathetic.

The flags in this country are fucking insane, I Dno what the obsession is
Holy shit I forgot all about those Boston dynamics robots. I have no idea what the military has in that dept. But it's a reassuring thought. I was watching clips of the tunnels under Gaza and it actually made me feel sorry for the poor fucks sent in there to fight.  It could very easily turn into an absolute slaughter for the IDF. But robots? Sheeeiiiit.
That's debatable. It's Domino's, after all.
Do they have a McDonald's? Cuz I can imagine a lot of amenities.
War is a front by lockmart to sell more planes
Yeah, no real comparison but that doesn't stop the flags going up to show support for either side, no doubt riling up old divisions. Parts of Belfast is like driving from proxi Tel Aviv into Gaza ffs.
Source on any of this? Just wondering so I would like to hear about that
Depends on what narrative you are claiming as true.  As far as the narrative from Genesis the tribes of Israel settled originally in Goshen which is in modern day Egypt and it was only with King David in 1000 BCE that they arrive and properly settle the kingdom of Israel.  The Philistines were there by then.  If you like the secular narrative that Judaism stems from Canaanite and Babylonian beliefs based on modern archaeology then you get to your claim.  However, the Jews do not ascribe to this belief for obvious reasons.
The 600,000 Jackson Hinkle subscribed bots ready to flood twitter with millions of tweets showing bombed syrians as alleged victims of the IDF:Israel lost the propaganda war before it even started.....
FFFFFFkkkkkkk I was hoping you guys wouldn't find out about this. Ah well. This video was taken with a batch of Special Ed students.   Next week, all whole week is designated "Palestine Solidarity Week", under "Humanity" reasons, orders of the Ministry of Education. Schools are instructed to hold a launching in school assembly, start a collection for "the Palestinian people", show videos and music that is "suitable for the human rights issues in Palestine".   Official govt response is that this was done before the instruction to hold a solidarity week, and they will "instruct schools to monitor their solidarity week".
those rooms dont even have doors; you wouldnt be able to get anywhere!
Bombs are not usually supersonic. With no propulsion, they will slow down quickly even if the jet is supersonic.
&gt; But you can't tear them downWell, you can tear them down, or attempt to, but be prepared for people to take that as a hostile anti-Jewish action, especially in NYC, which has a massive Jewish population (and people with Jewish ancestors who may not explicitly align as Jewish). There was another video of a younger trendy person doing the same yesterday in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, which has a large [Jewish enclave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Williamsburg,_Brooklyn#Hasidic_Jewish_community).
According to this it‚Äôs Utah. My grandfather is somewhere down there https://www.backtonormandy.org/the-history/timeline/1944/187158-aerial-photograph-of-utah-beach-on-6-june-1944.html
The old round parachutes are used because they are:- simple- effective at the very low heights of airborne insertions (800-1200 ft)- have almost zero room for user error- have a high weight capacity for heavily loaded soldiers. And probably because they are cheap.

Wonder are there people going to be detained under ISA or SOSMA for the next few days?
Wow!!!!! üëèwell done and said. No sugar coating there. Somebody had to do it. As a matter of fact I would like to share this with your permission. This needs to go far and wide.
You‚Äôre wrong
People in the DC area have gotten wind of Major Military Shit about to commence when all the pizza places near the Pentagon in Alexandria are suddenly super busy on a random night.
They love to wallow in their misery.
nah im just saying that assuming every large missile strike is hitting a Hamas Base (as claimed) than a awful lot of Hamas bases are discovered and destroyed, even though a major attack was not discovered.
Israel isn‚Äôt afraid of any Arab state. Israelis do not want the extermination of Palestinians
Yeah, i'd imagine that Iran let their puppets know that they have to start attacking or lose support.
SCP SECRET LABS REFERENCE???
dont care, all we want is a stable government devoid of religious radicalism, race does not matter
Take this too far and you start believing the US created ISIS, meanwhile the Saudis, Pakistanis, Syrians, Egyptians, ect run away laughing.
Unconditional surrender

Protest is not supposed to be convenient.
is this before or after the US spec force tier 1 ultra operators drop concrete melting nerve gas into the tunnels to paralyze all the children?
During one of the major peaceful resolution opportunities, a right-wing Netanyahu supporter assassinated the then Israeli PM because he was working with the Palestinians towards peace.
Palestinians truly deserve their own state, but they have never wanted one so long as Israel exists. What else can be done? Calling for Israel to be eliminated means a genocide far beyond but we're seeing in Gaza. The only thing I will say is that settlements in the West Bank should be eliminated. But that won't change much, Hamas will continue to call for the end of Israel and the conflict will never end.
You didnt see cobra commander? Or the Gorilla?
Fucking legends ! People that benefit from living in a free and open country after immigrating.. only to promote the shit that they left because of like how stupid can you be‚Ä¶
Ok I‚Äôll ask what the fuck is the pizza meter?
You obviously don't know what carpet bombing is, so why use such a term without knowledge ?
So you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs a chance?
It would be, problematic for the IDF to use the same method the Nazis used when they realized shooting all the Jews was not fast enough. Their first experiment with gassing was diesel engine exhaust.
im actually pretty curious of the context of this  edit: nevermind i let the video go on a bit more lmao
‚ÄúIsrael offered for Egypt to take‚Äù L O fucking L. Ita not theirs to offer. Thats part of the issue
They had to stop released Apache and ac130 FLIR footage because of how brutually it showed Taliban insurgents being wrecked .Have you seen some of those gun cams when they take out a whole platoon of Taliban soliders ? Yeah that stopped once enough media sources complained about how brutual it was . Even though it is some of the best combat footage out there.
The Americans were foreign soldiers israel  is neighbours with gaza they can't just go home
I remember thinking as a kid that these idiots looked ridiculous and I'm still thinking the same today.
The only thing stopping Israel is the Arab states surrounding them and the global outrage they'd face. It would be the same thing preventing them too.
Terrorists lose

You do know that it's fine to admit that you know nothing, right? Ever heard of Plato? He came up with it for a reason. In the absence of good data, it is not a good idea to use bad data.
Blessings Israel. Thoughts and prayers
That‚Äôs interesting. I was guided by a Christian Palestinian who was absolutely lovely. He hated all the fighting and seemed like a true innocent bystander. With that said he did say there were certain places we shouldn‚Äôt go and he wouldn‚Äôt take us for our own safety.

i mean dont need a specialist... you know what likes tunnels, gas, gas likes tunnelsjust think what would canada do
Palestine have decline many 2 state solution in 75 years. Maybe free Palestine from Hamas and IR
Israel holiday hostages for years
Israel tried just that. The Israeli government has Palestines as elected officials. There are numerous Palestinians who live in Israel. All of the Jews who did live in Gaza and the West Bank were targeted, threatened, and beaten, to the point they had to move. Israel gave them pockets within their region in hopes they would thrive. They pulled out their military in these areas so they could live their best life and all that did was create a vacuum for them to create terrorists groups that consistently fire rockets into Israel. It‚Äôs not just Israel who‚Äôs had issues, that‚Äôs why Egypt is pushing back to allow them to flee to their country because history has shown they are a violent group. There‚Äôs people saying that the Palestinians are innocent yet there were 100‚Äôs of videos of Hamas fighters bringing dead and alive Jews back into Gaza after their attack on October 7th and these ‚Äúinnocent people‚Äù were hitting, kicking, cheering, and spitting on the deceased and hostages. Those same ‚Äúinnocent people‚Äù were celebrating in the streets on September 11th 2001 when America was attacked and four planes were hijacked killing thousands of Americans. Different countries have tried to be diplomatic with them for decades, it‚Äôs got them no where. At this point they are left with no option aside from eradicated them from the face of the planet.
They were alive when they were taken as hostages, they died after the IDF vaporized them with a hellfire missile or crushed them in a tunnel using a bunker buster yes.
*Bomb planted*
Gotta keep digging
Who‚Äôs defending Hamas? I‚Äôm pointing out obvious facts.You‚Äôre watching massive explosions and buildings being brought down on Hamas targets (per the IDF) then playing dumb to the idea that Hamas would hold hostages in the same areas they would hole up in.So yes, if the hostages were alive then died after an air strike, they died ‚Äúbecause of the strikes.‚Äù&gt; Israel made a choice, but they can‚Äôt kill 2 million and they‚Äôre having plenty of kids.Ok, whatever this fuck this means.

Afghanistan was not the wrong country. Bin Laden was in Afghanistan after 9/11. The Taliban went with Muhammad Omar's order to not turn over or expel Bin Laden -- even though after the embassy bombings he had asked bin laden to chill with the international terrorism while in Afghanistan. So, for years the Taliban allowed Bin Laden to remain despite knowing what he was up to. He issued the call for JIhad against the US and its citizens in 98. Bin Laden did not escape into Pakistan until after the US invasion. So, we definitely shouldn't have been giving Pakistan all those billions, but we couldn't exactly attack Pakistan. It was already on shaky ground and they got nukes. Real sad state how much we paid them.The way the US went about Afghanistan was extremely flawed. Treating the Taliban as inseparable from Al qaeda was a mistake. Trying to nation build was a mistake. If you mean Saudi Arabia, Bin Laden and al qaeda were the Issue not the Saudi government. He was in exile. He had some supporters, but he had some supporters in every single Islamic nation basically. The Saudi royal family is huge. Bin Laden hated the US specifically because of the influence of the US over the Saudi King. He didn't need the support of those people. Iraq was some straight up unjustified invasion.
Israel doesn't and will never do that. They have complete disregard for Palestinian lives
I like the armed guard patrolling around, just in case Israel sends in the big guns he‚Äôs there to stop it
They already killed 50 there was a statment put out by hamas yesterday they blamed israel again tho
You do realize its not in their hand, right? That means Israel has a free pass to bomb them? You can blame hamas but the people were still bombed by an IDF fighter jet
Probably has no real comparison to Israel and Palestine at all, but being from Northern Ireland we have learned (mostly) to live with each other in one place. I hope this happens in Israel and Palestine too. It‚Äôs just tragic scenes on both sides.
Those dudes made Overwatch 2 porn within 24 hours of the game files being released, I don't put anything past 3D modelers who are motivated to have a fast turnaround time.
Can't believe a word you iterate when you blatantly lie about "losing her legs" to accentuate your bias - shows you are not looking for any truth.
Yep they are showing their true colors. They have complete disregard for human life. They oppress people and traumatize them then wonder why they are resisting and then they disproportionately react to their resistance creating more broken people who will only resort to more extreme measures and the cycle continues.
Man sometimes I really hate my country and good thing I‚Äôve graduated from secondary school a few years back so I wouldn‚Äôt need to take part in thisThere‚Äôs even rumors about that we‚Äôre going to send troops to Palestine to conduct peacekeeping missions as part of the UN Not to mention that there was this government sponsored rally/activity about wanting to get funds to help Palestine a few days ago
If it does, eradicate that threat before they are fighting age and procreate. All of these Middle East countries have been the biggest threat to the world for decades. From an early age they go to their education facilities and are taught to hate groups becoming indoctrinated to know no better. Any country that sends money to these radical countries should be heavily sanctioned to the point it destroys their way of life and destroys them financially. If no money is funneling it‚Äôs was to the terrorist groups it will eventually come to an end.
The Jews are the descendents of Canaanites, and some modern-day Palestinians can trace their ancestry back to the canaanites . The Philistines are from Crete. Palestinians are not the same as Philistines. Philistines invaded around 1050 BCE.
There is 500km of tunnels. Nobody can seal the whole thing unless they plant nukes in there.
Yes. lets talk about it. Please answer my question before being rude and trying to change the topic. Why does the UN call it Apartheid? Have you read their report from 2023?
Is there not a possibility this will radicalise another generation. Like the trauma of a population going through what they‚Äôre going through in Gaza is going to cause another level of hatred towards Israel, that might be even worse than it is already.Israel may get rid of Hamas, but they might create an even more intense ideology.
They are very inconvenient to the occupiers.
Ya they should have kept just asking for control of their own water and power and building supplies and medicine. That would have worked. Genius.
Ok, if you want to talk about Apartheid, let's talk about it. What can you tell me about the Palestinian people who live and work in Israel? Even those arabs that are serving in the IDF? What can you tell me about those merchants who cross the border between Gaza and Israel to sell their goods in the Israeli market? What can you tell me about those Palestinian people who try to become Israel citizens?
So you know my data from the UN is wrong, but are unwilling to suggest another source of data or suggest the correct figures. Ill use the data from the UN instead of trusting your feelings. Thanks for sharing!
Man, I joined this sub for the Ukraine memes because I support a free, prosperous, and most importantly independent Ukraine because I think occupation and ethnic cleaning...are bad. I thought we were all in agreement on that but watching you all go full cheerleader for a settler colonial fascist state turning one of the most densely populated places in the world into a glass floor has been uh. Something.
This is true. LPG also expands 270X when it becomes a gas.One or two trucks could cover 100s of thousands of sq ft.Just gotta make sure you get the right fuel/air mixture

The name "Palestine" first appeared in Assyrian documents as "Plistu". Assyrians conquered the region in the 8th century BCE.

Just seal of the tunnels, power the hospital with diesel generators, and route the exhaust into the tunnels.Done and done.
This isn‚Äôt the case in the west bank though where their government actually recognizes israels sovereignty. Since 2005 when the PA was elected there they have been peaceful. And what do they get in return? Illegal settlers rampaging and pillaging their towns at will, killing anyone who stands  in their way while they steal their land, homes, possessions and burn down their mosques and churches. And if the people in the west bank as much as touch a hair on their head in retaliation they spend decades in prison. How is this fair? Even in places where Hamas isnt , israel still treats the Palestinians like garbage. How can there be peace like this?
Was it a propaganda account? All of a sudden everyone got downvoted on this thread lol
Palestine:  from Latin *Palestina* (name of a Roman province), from Greek *Palaistinƒì* (Herodotus), from Hebrew *Pelesheth* "Philistia, land of the Philistines"  [palestine | Search Online Etymology Dictionary (etymonline.com)](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=Palestine) Huh TIL
Yeah you can easily say that in the comfort of your home. Human life to you is worthless. Incase you didn't know, this is not how it works, war has rules and what you just said is extremely criminal I am flabbergasted that you said it, you leave me no room to argue.
Trash!
Getting Azovstal flashbacks lmao
Yay go get them Israel!!
Most likely because a group of people lived there south of the Canaanites before the tribes of Israel ever got there: the Philistines.
Why doesn't IDF just shoot the red barrels? Are they stupid?
I can't believe that Optimus Prime joined Hamas. It's over- billions must perish...
I remember seeing the video of the missile manufacturing. They were cutting up water pipes, machining and painting them. I‚Äôm not sure about the source or credibility, but that might help with your google search.
It's mind boggling how divisive this entire Israel vs Palestine conflict it. Can't we ALL agree that killing innocent civilians and kidnapping them regardless of religion or geological location is wrong?

Straight ripping
I wouldn‚Äôt rape, or kill kids only to justify my oppression!
And then what do you think happens when the war is over? You think Israel would let them come back? They don‚Äôt have the greatest track record. I think Israel should have set up a massive camp, yes, outside of Gaza where women , children and families would have been allowed safe passage to. Of course the area would be monitored by soldiers and other humanitarian agencies.
Get ‚Äòem boys!
Phase II of f$&amp;k around and find out.
Damn. I mean....  They could have started all this with the song "milkshake" And dumped 4 shotgun shells into the roof for maximum recruitment tho
I have literally no idea and I would never pretend otherwise.
And the Jews conquered someone else, so what?
This is bullshit. If Hamas had the firepower Israel has they would have nuked all the Jews years ago
Isn‚Äôt this organized by Jewish voices for peace?
Where‚Äôs the massacre?
Ok. How many children do you think Israel has killed since the start of the war?
Well, that certainly explains the hundreds dead and thousands wounded in the peaceful Gaza protests of 2018-9‚Ä¶ UN investigations showed that &gt;99% of these were unjustifiable.
The name " Palestine" was given to the land by the Romans after they conquered the Jews and sacked Jerusalem.
Don't forget all the gazans they have summarily executed for wanting a less extreme form of government.

I have a coworker who‚Äôs Iranian (she was actually in Iran on October 7th and had to return to the US quickly). According to her the vast majority of the Iranian population absolutely hates their religious government and want it gone.They have kind of the same split America does. The people in the cities are generally against the Iranian government but the people in the country side (who tend to be more religious) are pro-government.
They 100 percent are which is why every post in support of Palestine or displaying protests showing Palestinians have comments mad and angry and asking why people care. They want to incite apathy and hopelessness in people so they don't speak up and to make people doubt that folks in the real world are in Palestine's side. People all over the WORLD are marching in the THOUSANDS in support of Palestine. From the UK to France to Ireland to Afghanistan to LA  to New York. The UN called for a ceasfire. Thousands of people are donating to Palestinian aid and causes.The only ones stuck inside and not reflective of the real world are the losers on reddit still trying to convince everyone else that Israel carpetbombing innocent civilians including the hostages they declined to take back is okay.Do not fall for their lies that the world isn't on the side of good. Don't fall for the lie that many Jewish people don't oppose the occupation and ethnic cleansing of Gaza. They do, and they're marching too. Don't fall for the lie that people don't care. Don't fall for the lie that the People aren't on the side of freedom for the Palestinians. They're in the death throes of neocolonialism and they're trying every tactic in the book.
Calling for the abolishment of Israel is not calling for the killing of everyone inside it. It's insanely disingenuous to interpret that slogan this way.
 i do not doubt this one bit about the reality of down and dirty conflict but what everyone needs to see about " the truth" as this war they are trying to spark will drag us down with it there will be no victors
OCHA field staff, who collected the data, in Gaza and the West Bank is virtually entirely comprised of Palestinians. The UN has been heavily criticized for not vetting their local employees at all and there have been numerous cases of UN employees being caught for assisting Hamas. Random example (with another bonus case of another humanitarian aid worker working for Hamas):https://www.wtvq.com/israel-charges-un-employee-in-gaza-strip-for-assisting-hamas/
To be fair, my impression of the SLDF at Tukayyid:"The 'mech with the PPC, shoots! The one without the PPC, follows! When the one with PPC gets cored, the one following picks up the PPC and shoots!"
This activity from Israel is well documented. They have been doing it for quite a while. Sadly so has the activity from Hamas.
Those poor people :( this is a nightmare
You can see the line of destruction stretching from the coast line. Naval, grenades, arty, and satchels.
It is worth mentioning that in his time, he was loathed. Even the liberals thought he was too assertive and his tactics wouldn't work because they pissed people off.It's worth considering this if you're feeling compelled to complain about protesters. You would have been complaining about MLK. Period. That's who you are today, and that's who you would have been then.I choose to be someone else.
Are you able to discuss why the UN calls it Apartheid?Or are you going to deflect from the reality of the situation by minimizing me instead of my argument?
Boohoo, you are ruining one day of mine to protest and demand our government to stop funding and backing up a genocide, boohoo my day boohoo boohoo
Wtf?
Surgical targeted attacks are great for just that, taking out maybe a handful of the important big bads. What they don't do is search for the average Hamas militant doing the shooting, the don't provide a public face for capturing hearts and minds, nor do they hold ground.Surgical strike teams are more like a fire extinguisher, and ground forces are more like a full fire-supression system/firefighting crew. I think Israel's not taking any chances on keeping embers smoldering this time around.
Ah yes because propping up the religious nuts to undermine your more reasonable enemies has never gone badly for anyone else in recent memory
Yep.  Just ask the Crusader Clanners.  They dialed 1-800-OH-SHIIT
"their holy lands"Israel has been slowly taking over the West Bank, which is supposed to be Palestinian territory, for decades. Who is removing people from their lands again?
It‚Äôs funny even Jews are against Israel now
Impartial media (like Walter Cronkite im assuming) is inefficient at producing profits. People need mental shortcuts and desire biased news to reduce their own need of using critical thinking (which is a lot after working a 9-5).
Do you just randomly post without doing the most basic of internet searches? https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualtiesAs you can see, over the past 20 years - until October - Israel has maintained a steady 21:1 KD ratio for civilian's. According to the UN. Not me.
I learned from Battletech that you don't mess with Space AT&amp;T.
Not yet. Shaping missions, weeks of this children. Weeks of this.
&gt; They had a nation way before thatWho was the Palestinian president before 1948? What were some laws the Palestinian government passed at the time? What were their policies, what kind of government did they have? What was their foreign policy?Oh wait, there was no Palestinian nation.
Only if you feed folks grass first, I guess. Do toes count as cloven hoofs?
Cute, if only this war started the Oct 7th, but guess the fuck what? it has been happening for decades upon decades. Fuck israel.
Wrong, only one side wants genocide.
And cuckoldry part?
It's pretty simple. He just hates Jews.
Hamas is devil killing Palestinians
Operation Flambe is officially a go!
That saying is interpreted in different ways. Do you know why I think most people say it in the USA? I think it is because it rhymes and works well as a protest chant...not because they want to genocide the Jewish people of Israel.
Hamastimus Palesprime
It seems to have gotten worse though don‚Äôt you think? I‚Äôm so tired of propaganda wars. I wish we could just have impartial ‚Äúnews‚Äù reporting on facts rather than there having to be a narrative and not so hidden agenda all the time. I‚Äôve given up on news except local stuff to my state/town. It‚Äôs just all so frustrating. I can see how people become so disillusioned with it all and go off the deep end while trying to source ‚Äúfacts‚Äù and end up being conspiracy lunatics. I feel like that‚Äôs enough internet for the day.
This is gonna be a disaster. I‚Äôm gonna turn off the internet for a few days, then poke my head back out later‚Ä¶
That would be a pretty good idea actually. In that case you should put the main gunner's sight on the commander's side. This would be a lot less obstructive, and you wouldn't have all your optics on the same side making it more vulnerable.

Do you just randomly make up stuff for every topic or just this one?
The media wants to be embedded with the US gov for prime time spots on news info. They will always be the mouthpiece of the gov.
Actually, this is a photo of a non-violent protest.Stop the hate.
Tens of thousands of Gazans worked in Israel, thousands were being treated in hospitals, they could use Israeli airports to travel, they got water, electricity and telecommunications for free and Israell was in talks with Hamas until literally the day of the attack to create an off-shore gas platform so that the strip could become energy independent and export this resource.You tell me what's actually going on here.

People don‚Äôt exist anymore. It‚Äôs very sad but if it‚Äôs not somebody you know, it‚Äôs just a faceless being either on your side or the enemy‚Äôs side. I hate this shit.
How to win NYers support 101.
i need the rest of that recording please
It‚Äôs crazy to me that this sentiment is being downvoted throughout this thread as if either side is completely blameless or as if the civilians are the ones committing these atrocities. People really just want ‚Äútheir side‚Äù to win and are ignoring any kind of nuance because that requires thought instead of uncontrolled anger.
Does look like an F-15 hud. Engagement seems to be at about 5000 ft @ \~ 350 kts. Fairly low and slow - makes sense for a slow-moving target like a drone. Not sure what kind of missile that is, but the close engagement distance and the missile lock tone suggests an IR guided missile, so Python or AIM-9.
&gt;  but so is the concerted effort to ethnically cleanse the region by the Israeli governmentIsrael has repeatedly made attempts to help Gaza, and every attempt has blown up in their face.
Israel has offered Palestine two state solution and offered for Egypt to take the Gaza Strip. Both were denied. The problem is Palestinians want to remove Israel from their holy lands and will keep inflaming this conflict until it happens.
Proof of Palestinians peacefully protesting and then being massacred please
Well you see, they were so focused on what‚Äôs under the ground instead of what‚Äôs above.
I mean- this is not non credible. Hamas‚Äô headquarters has been inside Al Shifa headquarters since the 90s. It‚Äôs public knowledge.
Ready for the real crazy part, Ukrainians soldiers are currently using Iranian mortars and ammo seized on their way to the Houtis.
Kinda a bad example as we attacked the wrong countries in retaliation.
In theory a nerve Gass with low lethality would be the most humane option that would also allow for prisoners to be taken and hostages to be rescued.Russians tried it during a school siege in the 90s and killed most of the hostages, but that's Russians.  All the smart ones emigrated to Israel.
Problem is both sides in charge want to exterminate the other and civilians are stuck in the middle.  And the problem has only been going on for hundreds of years.
Have fun dealing with the fact that you publicly supported a genocide while it was happening in plain sight in front of your face. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll feel great about it in a couple years

Hamas aren‚Äôt the ones that want peace, many of the people at this protest were actually Jewish. Both the Israeli government and Hamas want this war to continue, it furthers both of their narratives. It‚Äôs the civilians who will suffer.
Rammstein concert
&gt;I'm actually a little surprised that it doesn't happen by design more often.We have no idea how often it happens and how many people it kills. Hamas just lumps it into the total death count. Considering every single person killed is apparently a civilians.
Yeah of HAMAS
The forgotten beast is Saddam laying down there
Do I have reporter piss on me?
Yep.  Hamas is the voice of the people 35 and older (the last ones allowed to vote).
And what happens to the West Bank where Israel keeps building settlements while pushing off Palestinians inhabitants?
be the change you want to see in the world
IDF will invade this and before they know they'll be facing falmers
**Screwing with the public before, or after, a long hard day at work during rush hour**, yeah, that ***always*** leans me towards supporting somebody's cause! **Said nobody ever.** *Remember, timing is everything in a battle.*
Be nice if they decided they couldn't take Hamas anymore. Their neighbors know who they are

It wouldn't be much of an obstruction considering he's gonna be the one using the optics. You can also place it similarly to how it's situated on the Leclerc tank where it's not placed directly in front of the hatch but slightly offset towards the center.

lol, I remember thinking that after the Afghanistan and Iraq invasions.

They can't use gas since Israel signed the Geneva Conventions, and yeah they probably have sump pumps and watertight sections

Wrong answer. Gaza is besieged, they were told to go south, they got bombed in the South, where shall they go? When you blockade people then bomb them, don't ask third parties to bare your responsibilities. When they are told to go south, they shouldn't get bombed in the south.
You think mourning the dead includes the Jews Hamas killed?

That‚Äôs a good point. I know a lot of current/former military personnel follow this sub. I don‚Äôt understand why the airborne still use the old school round parachutes. I‚Äôve wondered if I was alive back then what I‚Äôd rather do freeze in Bastogne or get trench foot in the pacific. My great grandpa was in the army during WWII. He is dead now but when I was a kid during forth of July stuff at ball parks and such when they ask veterans to stand. He never would because he just put gas in airplanes. Those guys were cut from a different cloth.
What would happen if Hamas found the circus?
Its wild that Israel knows every tunnel under every hospital yet cant figure out a massive and coordinated military attack on its territory???

As a union person this is true. But it‚Äôs about who you‚Äôre disrupting.  Disrupting your peers and irrelevant people gets you nothing.    This size of a protest in front of a person or place that would actually be relevant would get as much attention and none of the bad that‚Äôs gonna turn a big portion off your cause.
Nobody is carpet bombing. The REAL problem is people like you that don't have a clue what is actually going on, but are still willing to speak up as if they have something important to say.

If Hamas is holding them and Israel is leveling every building and tunnel Hamas operates in it's not exactly hard to believe.

I know, it‚Äôs just that the ID interceptors are more accurate when the rocket is in the descent phase, so Israel usually waits for that.These things are blowing up while they‚Äôre still climbing.Maybe the amount of rockets means they‚Äôre firing the ID faster so they don‚Äôt get overwhelmed.
Interesting. I ain't seeing a lot of Red Sea in that video, despite the jet making a sweeping turn.Are those mountains Jordon or Saudi Arabia? The topography doesn't look like the eastern Sinai.

The placement of the Commander's optic was kind-of just a stop-gap solution to the issue. I'll get around to properly implementing it at somepoint next next week (hopefully). I also do see you're concern regarding it being in line with the main gun. The problem is that I cannot place it behind the commander because that's were the blowout panels are, and I don't want to obstruct his view by putting it in front.
Exactly. Well put... shows just how ridiculous some people sound right now...

Band of Brothers is simply amazing. Can watch it a million times and never get tired of it.
Have you seen the satellite images of Hamas blocking the western highway with trucks and busses?
Oddly on reddit I have seen a lot more hatred towards Israelis then I could ever have expected, and I definitely wouldn't feel safe telling most people on here I am Israeli if I met them in person. Shit's getting downright scary. (I am not Israeli so don't kill me please.)
We can say the same thing about Jews and natzis why did you provoke them?
Ah it's all ok because they told people to leave.
My grandfather's brother died in Normandy, on D-day. Maybe your grandfather flew over him. They were great men...

You could make a religion out of that

Currently rewatching Band of Brothers and just thinking how they jumped out of perfectly good planes, land behind enemy lines, and not knowing if the beach landings would actually be successful
Did hamas get Richard Kiley to do the voice overs?
How do they get into that room with no doors lol

cant these use bone conduction through helmet instead or as well?
They almost certainly _were_ ambushed, or at least met very unexpected close contact.On the first day, many responding units had very little idea of the scale of the attack or how deeply some infiltration groups had reached. As a result, en route to their objectives, most of them encountered enemies -- not necessarily in ambushes, again, but often by total surprise.
They might be totalitarian religious fundamentalists but they still need their D&amp;D space.

They initial propellant charges just get the hamas rockets into the air, but they dont last all too long. Gravity does the rest.
The US killed 100,000 people at least in Iraq and Afghanistan after 9/11.  Proportional to population, the Oct 7 Hamas attack into Israel was 15 times deadlier than 9/11.  Israel is not just going to shrug their shoulders and ignore the attack. Telling them to do so is just stupid.

no, read the sentence before the comment about four a day and after. We were discussing journalists KILLED IN PALESTINE BY ISRAELIS. Hope that helps. I was the one who actually brought up issues for journalists worldwide. Not the person who claimed four per day.

3 weeks ago they were in an Apartheid prison and no one cared about them. They were always the victim. Which is why the UN calls it Apartheid.To fully qualify: Palestinians. Not Hamas.

Jews against Israel is always ignored by the West. Even more so if they‚Äôre Israeli.
This was released by the IDF spokesperson (logo on top left)
Have you ever looked at the number of innocent Palestinian victims who lost their lives in this lengthy conflict vs how many Israeli‚Äôs have? Hamas is a group, a terrorist organization. They do not represent all Palestinians . That mentality is like saying all Germans were Nazi‚Äôs . What about all the non Hamas supporting Palestinian victims ? The woman, the children? They heavily outweigh any number of Israeli victims over the last ten years . But lock em and load em cause Biden said so! And the media is pushing it down our throats . I feel for everyone affected but Israel has been bombing hospitals and daycares long before this shit was mainstream.
No one denies civilians casualties, but Hamas always makes propaganda about that. If you watch interviews in Gaza, nobody says something like: "Hamas did something horrible to Israel and now we're paying for those crimes." No, 3 weeks ago, they were celebrating the attack to Israel, the raping and kidnapping of innocent people, and now they try to be victims.
I don't understand why we can't just agree that yes, Hamas is fucking shit, but on the other side the far right Israelis are also fucking shit.Yes the kidnappings are an atrocity, but so is the concerted effort to ethnically cleanse the region by the Israeli government (supported by a large part of, if not majority of Israelis).The conflict in that region will never end because all that actively participate in it are malicious assholes. Fuck all those war mongering religious pieces of shit regardless of what religion they get high on to justify being human waste.
Oh i must have missed it, my bad.
The US, EU, and UN have spent billions of dollars ensuring that Hamas gets the most luxurious command bunkers possible. Every amenity is present, and no expense is spared.Millions of dollars of humanitarian aid have to go somewhere, and they‚Äôre obviously not rebuilding Gaza with it.

Supporting equality
Nice to see a community coming together to give this moron a swift kick in the ass
Yup, it‚Äôs pure insanity. I mean most individuals will fall victim to the many forms of media pushing this as a positive thing. When it‚Äôs all they see their celebrities support, news stations push, president and other world leaders calling for it , fb , twitter and instagram pushing it. You don‚Äôt carpet bomb areas and kill women and children by the masses and celebrate it. It‚Äôs just a powerful group controlling the narrative and telling you what to think. If you don‚Äôt think it you‚Äôre labelled terrible things and ruined or cancelled . Same narratives were present with covid , Ukraine / Russia , now Israel / Palestine . You support what they tell you to or else . The ‚Äúsupport‚Äù is paid for by your tax money while they siphon millions of tax dollars and return it to themselves down the line. War is profitable , and the people are now easily swayed. Very dangerous times.

This will be mostly my point, so I will put it straight up. I'm a Christian, I don‚Äôt agree with Muslim nor Jewish standards and beliefs, but I care about them as people regardless of what they believe inSo, Israel hasn‚Äôt shown any signs of them caring about civilian casualties, they have used White Phosphorus, targeted churches and mosques filled with people, and could or could have not targeted a hospital. I wouldn‚Äôt consider that to even be supposedly caring about civilian deaths.While it‚Äôs true that Hamas uses hospital and schools to build their vital rooms under and use international law to their advantage, I haven‚Äôt seen proof of them actually firing from schools and hospitals, it‚Äôs been only words and propaganda.I will never agree with neither Hamas' ideology nor Zionists' ideology, they both are being exploited and used as justification for terrorism for both sides.After expressing how both are terrorists with bloodthirsty ideologies and actions, Hamas are pretty smart and know when to perform operations, unlike any other Palestinian resistance movement before and they have been trying to bait Israel into invading since 2018 and now they got it, also Israel has a pretty negative record in doing ground operations. They have also proved to retreat pretty fast when they‚Äôre taking hard hits (1968 and 2006).They are able to destroy Hamas after a long time, but I don‚Äôt think the government will remain that long if they start losing people in thousands there with no real achievements.And lets say they do decide to continue and swallow up all these losses, what are they going to do next? Same occupation, apartheid and terrorism that they‚Äôre doing in the West Bank?The whole situation is not studied, it‚Äôs just Netanyahu's best option to remain in power and not get imprisoned. I'm not sure if I missed some points, I will recheck tomorrow.

I do wonder how much of that secularism was largely nominal/contained to the leaders and less so for the rest.
This is not a public freakout. Please do not post vids if they don't have a fight, tazing, freakout etc etc. I spent a whole minute looking for the fight and didn't see it. Was very disappointed.
I just saw something saying there were a lot more crossing into the northern portion of the Gaza Strip than in the limited incursions so far. I don‚Äôt know how accurate it is because I can‚Äôt remember where I saw it though. Edit: I think they were just referencing a slightly larger operation than the previous.
I'm pretty sure there even water tight doors to for JUST this thing. As well as keep IDF out or create killzones

Dear god! He made a modern version of the marauder.

Where Saddam
God's will be done.At the appropriate time,a dreadful storm will appear above Gaza,bringing intense heavy downpour for three days ,three nights,flooding most of Gaza.All the tunnel system will be flooded and destroyed. Hence Gaza,part of the Holy land will be thoroughly cleansed of all evil,and henceforth ,a new peaceful Gaza will emerge.

Last election was over a decade ago, 40% of Gaza is 14 and under. You're deluding yourself if you think all the people dying from this voted for it, fuck Hamas btw.
Secret IRA headquarters also known as your man Kieth's grannies garage with a fleg hung up
I see you've put the commander's optics onto the RCWS. I'm not sure the optics is scaled correctly. I think you should make it slightly bigger (A good reference would be how it looks on the Challenger 2 Black Night) and swap its position with the RCWS gun or place the gun over it (As I said before, look at how it's implemented on the T-90M or T-90MS) This would make the commander's optics position more stable. Another issue is putting the commander's optics on the same line with the gun would limit its ability to be used for aiming if the gun is at high elevation. This is why the optics is usually situated on the same line with one of the turrets hatches. With that in mind I think you should consider moving the whole RCWS-optics contraption somewhere in front of or behind the commander's hatch.

Yeah, people saying "just flood" and "just gas" the tunnels are in for a shock when the footage looks like an episode of SG1. Hamas have morbillions of ~~UN money~~ someones money and those tunnels are their lifeblood *and* they all just work for Iran, they are going to be making shithot tunnels.
Damn, Jews aren‚Äôt enough, we have to garner sympathy for literal hostages by saying it‚Äôs more than just Jewish people. This isn‚Äôt an attack on you, just the reality that people will care more if it‚Äôs not only Jewish people. That‚Äôs so so sad, and as a Jew myself, the online discourse has been honestly terrifying.

Reddit is ALSO media. Majority of the people are actually not outside protesting (for anything) and are in fact sitting at home doing their own thing.
They took a note from Hamas and built a pizza delivery tunnel. With phones to call in orders.
OPTIMUM PRIME ERUHERUH
Saw somewhere that Hamas said they aren't showing their full strength cuz they know this isn't the full invasion yet (That's from X though)
Very interesting considering the chosen media narrative.

"yet" being quite an important word in that sentance!
I think a lot of people forget this. They can wipe any country of the planet. If Russia had been submitted to a terrorist attack such as a few weeks ago their entire rhetoric would have been about nukes
Wow this is quite revealing about the biases toward which conflicts the media chooses to show.
Or they are doing a fake attack like last time hamas fired a ton of rockets back in 2022 (or was it 2021?): pretend to invade, hamas send fighters, bomb the shit out of the area, hundreds of hamas dead
Will try to post something about Brazil
Damn. The contrast between real life and our media couldn't be more different.Media and politicians would have you believe that the majority of people support Israeli war crimes

Dang this subreddit is actually insane. People literally calling for a genocide of Palestinians and get upvoted. You say ‚Äúhey genocide is actually bad‚Äù and you get downvoted and called a terrorist supported lmao
Either that or a barrage from the sea which would be my bet. They spent the last 2 days clearing the Gaza coastline and sending in special forces squads to destroy any Hamas facilities or weapons stockpiles. So they made it possible for them to get closer to the coastline without risk.https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/wml6KcAkgIIt'd be silly for Israel to start using artillery stockpiles now. Considering they have so many regional enemies bearing down on them  Plus the US is already committed most artillery to Ukraine. There's not enough in the world for everybody.Tons of naval shells to go around though.
Oh, I must not have seen that in the article I read. Why did they not get shot down more to the south though?? Like near the King Abdullah base or near Jazan?  The Carney was barely out of the Suez when it intercepted four missiles. Saudi Arabia has patriot batteries in the south‚Ä¶ I guess I just wait for more information but it seems a little fishy

it's another hospital that hasn't yet been blown up
Thats amazing man! reminds me of a challenger, do you think you could add some cameras? Like in the abramsX? So that the crew can have more visibility? Keep up the good work!
Yes.
Probably not even the actual invasion.  Maybe it is, but I would think they run a handful of raids and feints before completely committing to temporarily occupy.  Get a good feel for Hamas' defenses in multiple directions, make new inroads rather than use existing ones, understand how outside forces (Hezbollah) might respond, then fully commit.
F-15I firing a Python-3 ?  (my guess, I don't know)
I mean that's what HAMAS is, an organism that Israel funded in its infancy that has now returned to harm it.
have you even visited the cabinet war rooms? or Greenbrier https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_Greek_IslandMount Weather, a currently operating facility, is said to have 600k square feet of below ground space.Hamas has a shit load of tunnels for redundancy and so they can spend weeks or months below ground. You're thinking like someone with 4 weeks and 50k to spend on buried space. Not people who are getting $100 million a year from Iran and can steal money and material from the UN and have been prepping for almost two decades...
They‚Äôve sent in substantially more soldier than in the previous raids. Its the tip of the spear but it‚Äôs beginning.
Same.The NCD brainrot is strong.
It'll hurt, for sure, because Israel is \*supposed\* to care about civilian casualties, while Hamas is ok using their human shields as cover until they die to appease their fake god. They'll hide in their tunnels like rats, and rats are incredibly hard to kill in numbers. So yeah, they'll take losses - not because the other side is better, but because they have nothing of worth to lose, hide, and are fighting for a cause they think will matter after death - but means nothing.Hopefully Israel is prepared for those tunnels, they've been a pain for centuries, and I doubt the technology to wipe them out is efficient enough as of now to do it without taking a large amount of casualties.But they will. Hamas will be mist, and fade into blackness for eternity.*"The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees. The stones and trees will say O Moslems, O Abdulla, there is a Jew behind me, come and kill him.'"....There is no solution for the Palestine question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors.*To be deluded into thinking your death means anything other than bringing more death and suffering to the innocents surrounding them

Except it‚Äôs not, yesterday was more or less a tour of the inside of the border to secure it. Today it‚Äôs an expanded raid into Beit Hanoun and Burej with a fighting intent, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if they aim to hold them. I also don‚Äôt think the invasion will happen all at once.Also who knows, fog of war. But the fact that the IDF said that they are expanding the ground operation clearly indicates that it is a new phase in the war.
Actually yes, history shows Israel has already won 2 wars against much bigger Muslim neighbors.Nowadays, I say good fucking luck to any neighboring Muslim countries who wants to start a war with Israel, when Israel in fact is still a major ally of the U.S. in the region. So you would be delusional if you think the U.S. would not be directly supporting Israel and ensure that Israel would win against any Muslim country stupid enough to start a war with Israel. Those 2 Carrier Strike Groups parked right outside are there for a reason.
Are Jewish people werewolves? Lol
Oh yeah, sometimes A LOT in fact. Most heat seeking missiles these days have the ability to "slave" their seeker head to the radar, basically looking where it looks. Most radars can actually turn to track a target way further than missiles can turn their seeker head. You can acquire a target wayyyyy off to the side of your jet and the targeting computer will tell the missile to look in the correct direction as far as it can, then when the target finally enters the missile's field of view it will generate that famous tone. Some jets even have a targeting cue in the pilot's helmet that you can use to point the missile. So if you're in a dogfight and the neither the missile nor the radar can turn far enough to see the target but your head can, you can still point the missile and fire (leaving some bits out but that's the gist).Fun fact, originally that's what missile tone actually is - a direct connection to the seeker head of the missile and the pilot's ears. The seekers of the first missiles were analog and they output a sine wave which corresponded to what they were seeing. Some particularly clever dudes said hey light and sound both come in waves, and waves are just numbers maaaan, we can interpret this light wave as an audio wave.Some math and physics happened and they made the first IR guided missiles basically lol. When an IR missile is looking at empty blue sky, the light waves it is seeing all are the same frequency and amplitude. When that gets translated over to sound, the output is a white noise-ish sound because that's what the seeker is seeing: noise in the form of clear sky that is all the about the same temperature. When something hot comes into sight, suddenly there's light arriving at the missile that is different from the background. That also gets translated, and boom we have a higher pitched tone because that's exactly what the missile is seeing in light, but in sound. Any modern jets just like play a .wav file or some shit when the computer thinks it has a target, but way back in the day it was a literal wire from the pilot headphones to the missile seeker on the wing (through a bunch of complicated routing/switch/etc).
Why are the rokets so red?
Saudi Arabia *did* shoot one down, out of the same group where the Carney shot down four others. I guess the flight paths today put them into Israel's and Egypt's areas of responsibility.
Both sides have plenty of assholes but plenty of innocent people too.Acknowledging the latter doesn't mean you forget the former.
modern day warfare is insanely terrifying.   ww3 is going to destroy all of us
Vito from Staten Island holding it down for the USA
Was this the hospital that they blew up, or the one that they blew up because Hamas was using it, or the one that they didn't blow up because Hamas actually accidentally blew up?

You mind staying in Iran when you visit? I don't typically tell people what to do with their lives, but if you're going to say shit like that, we really don't want you in the US. We have enough problems with racists, fascists, and domestic terrorists as it is.
Why take a video of your TV in a well lit room? Why would you inflict us with this horribleness?
You said ‚Äúthe‚Äù ground operation. What‚Äôs the point of the definitive if it‚Äôs just like yesterday and the day before that (only bigger)?
Is it just Chatham or the whole area? I visited Rochester Castle once and it seemed nice. Also visited Cliffe Fort that day, which was fun. Not sure if that was allowed though, given the fence I had to get over and the security guard van headed in the opposite direction just a we were driving away..

You are not nearly as smart as you think you are and you have proven that you have no idea what the big words you are using actually mean.
Sad thing about this whole war, is that there is so much hatred for their brothers and sisters, that as both sides loose innocent victim after innocent victim, both sites display pitty bullying tactics to laugh at the other side when they have the advantage. It‚Äôs childish, and the children are paying with their lives because of it.
Yeah this shows nothing.
Absolutely based New Yorkers. Hell yeah
I‚Äôve never wanted to see someone follow through with their aggression more than I have watching this video
"We"? See this through and decide if you want to be like Gaza.

Reminds me of the Rockstar logo animation when GTA V starts up.
Want to know a cool fact?Was talking with a Malay colleague of mine about the Israel-Palestine conflict and it led to me giving her a choice. If she had to choose one only which would she resonate more with: supporting Palestinians or hating Jews?I don't think I need to say moreOf course this one person does not represent the entirety of Malays in Malaysia but...yea
The Filipinos are the only ones who are good at fighting but they also have zero money for... reasons.
Did you just make a genocidal threat?
All those construction materials, labour hours, and additional resources went some where
Putting things into perspective in a slightly snarky fashion, would be my guess. They aren't wrong, even if I wouldn't have used this kind of wording. What we are seeing now is nothing compared to the full invasion.
Fantastic!
Is Saddam down there somewhere too?
Even the military sucks, I think the LCS project will go to the shadow realm with the constant delays.
Didn't explode on impact though
I have a feeling they blow themselves up more often than actually hitting an Israeli.
No no, i think you‚Äôve misread. I wrote ¬´¬†ground operation¬†¬ª, not ¬´¬†invasion¬†¬ª

Prisoners of hamas more like it. Shame they voted for hamas though. So whose to blame?

The real secret biolabs were in Gaza all along!
God damn that guy in the visibility vest just saved that other  guy from the dude he pulled back, he would have wiped the floor with him.
You are talking absurd nonsense. Do you understand that for the past 15 years (when Hamas have been in power) entry and exit into Gaza is very strictly controlled; electricity, water supply, imports/exports very strictly controlled and limited by Israel; mass unemployment; Gazans have been regularly bombed, shot at the border, arrested and interned etc etc. Suggesting a beach resort is utterly laughable.
Very true, mfw Indonesia might end up being a better Allie and neighbours than Malaysia.My dreams of ASEAN military alliance is dead.
Time for Singapore to make Malaysia regret not wanting to unify.
Already broke Rule#1 - Don't download porn.

I can only get so erect
You get the credit, as you suggested it. Is there anything else you think I could add?
Israel operates both the F-15I and F-15C.  The C is mostly for air superiority, so makes sense that they scrambled those.
Gaza is a tough girl she can take it all.  Send in all the men and tanks.
looks more like crayon art with that camera quality
What I learned from visiting the Palestinian parts of the West Bank was that violence was their path. Anything short of getting control of Jerusalem was a non starter for them. None of this is surprising.
I don't believe them
SAS and KSK have joined the chat !
If you think about it, this means that every time Space AT&amp;T has a technical issue, Naboo calls up its reserves and hands gungans explody things
Wow so the missile's sensors can move and change directions, even when they are still on the jet?  Pretty cool!
Agree.  But I think they are just ripping off a chunk. I don‚Äôt think it will be a blitzkrieg. They will rip off one chunk after another and gradually squeeze them.  The footage, albeit dark, showing a shit ton of activity right now.
The world is going to be a better place, wait and see
imagine u being occupied and under siege
Something something, Israelis disguised as Mexicans, something something "we learned how not to use our strength from you"
Youre a rock starEdit: saw you put up the tours site. These guys/gals are incredible. Did a tour of Omaha and Point Du Hoc back in 18. We did the US airborne stuff and Utah on our own but the tours are so worth the money.
Bless, i knew it wasnt Omaha at least and dont know what juno sword or gold looked like so thank you. Cheers
I'd have thought they'd wait until Ike got into position
i love that their youtube channel gained 200k subs since October 7 lmao
Sword beach, June 6, 1944Edit: the aerial shot is credited to the ninth airforce so I think that‚Äôs why there‚Äôs a bit of confusion as to whether it‚Äôs Utah or Sword.[Normandy Tours](https://www.battleofnormandytours.com/photo-sword-gold-brit-airborne.html) link. [Modern aerial view](https://www.hosiho.com/en/images/photos/20468/coastal-region-quistreham-normandy-france-aerial-photography.html) from Quistreham, looking down towards Lion-sur-Mer.

World demands a stop to Allied offensive, cites terrible loss of civilians, German soldiers hearing loss. Need to make sure German soldiers have adequate food and water!
Can‚Äôt wait till the find Saddam‚Äôs Hamas cousin
I was just watching some live footage. Of course it‚Äôs dark and can‚Äôt see shit, but lots of booms and activity. . This incursion if for sure the biggest one yet. Wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if IDF holds a piece of Gaza after this one, albeit not a big piece.
Ah Chatham, the birth place of the chav which was surely a British government eugenics program to make a more aggressive soldier gone wrong which escaped into the wilds of Kent then spread like rats to the rest of the UK
Generally not true for the F-15I, they do their fair share of ground attacks too
Most Malays in Malaysia support terrorism.
I'm not way smarter than you but looks like Sword based on the depth of the beach, the way it opens up on the left, and the pathing. I was thinking Sword or Utah but that little loopy path on the left makes me think SwordETA: I am not confident in my answer
&gt;This is also why Singapore is so well armed.Singapore is the Israel of Southeast Asia.
The futility of it all, I wonder how long it will take for Gazans to realize how embarrassing it is. I still see videos of them praising the launches of what used to be their water infrastructure.
Hamas said it themselves. It‚Äôs clearly u know not Inothibg about the war.
We have all learned in the last 20 years how much pain in insurgency can cause their opponents in Afghanistan and Iraq.So please Israel, do it, create your own Afghanistan on steroids. I, for one, would enjoy the shitshow at your expense.
Needs more c4-vests...
I'll get downvoted to oblivion for this but since when has this sub been so one sided in its discourse of this conflict. Never have I seen more people justifying the indiscriminate bombing campaign of a civilian population before, not even on WorldNews. How many children have to die before there is justice? 2000? 5000? 10000? Disgusting.
Then it's a massive hostage situation and the only way to get it done is boots on the ground.
I spent my time in the shower this morning laughing at the phrase "Five Eyes Burgers and Fries".
Start extending Rochester airfield for some heavily laden aircraft would be a great weekend activity
Guys chill, there are plenty of indications that this isnt the ground invasion. Both the IDF and the White House came out and said this is a limited ground incursion.The fact that this is limited, should tell us just how apocalyptic the real invasion will be.
Moons out, goons out!
Agree. There is 0 chance that these posters will do anything to help locate these people.  But you can't tear them down, they represent other people's tragedies. The appropriate way to deal with it would be to counter with posters of the harm done to Palestinians.
The center text really made me think I was going cross eyed for a second
No no, i think you‚Äôve misread. This isn‚Äôt *the* invasion. It‚Äôs the third night they are doing ‚Äútargeted raids‚Äù. The invasion would be much larger, and would be about conquering, not raiding.
What do you think the Iron Dome intercepts
I'm saying if I'm the Hamas I'm using all my under ground storage space for weapons and ammo and useful facilities. You can have a goddamn meeting in a storage room! Doesn't need to be the dangerous stuff, it can be where you keep food or water stocks or whatever. If you're tunneling out an entire goddamn room just for a table and some middle management chairs then that is a waste of tunneling. Also tunneling out to make rooms in general is WAY harder then tunneling out, well, tunnels. We've got some footage of their tunnels from 2014 and from the recently uncovered tunnels what we see there makes way more sense, you see ammo and communications shit on the walls in relatively narrow actual tunnel structures. It's a much better use of space and what you can do with tunnel operations like this. Narrower spaces are also a lot easier to booby trap, which is important for any tunnel system you plan to use for an offense.
yep and maybe also to show them the gloves are off this time around and that they better release the hostages
What a beast, love it. He will carry the boats
Oh, I agree, Pk is high, but not 100%
And 90% of them are Westerners who Hamas would not hesitate to behead or take hostage. For shame.
You think they actually have the ability to aim these things that much? I imagine the CEP on those is in the range of kilometers
I'm checking frame per frame... But no, no sadam here, my day is ruined and my disappointment is immense
But the missiles that were intercepted by the USS Carney were in the northern part of the Red Sea. It doesn‚Äôt make sense for it to be a Saudi target, but also it doesn‚Äôt make sense why the Saudis didn‚Äôt shoot it down?
Nice improvements. That add-on NERA really does make it look more like a modern MBT. Keep up the good work!
actually, hamas tried an improvised explosive submarine, it got destroyed by the navy before deployment but there was an attempt
The square is the radar painting where the target is on the hud. The circle is the where the missile's seeker head is looking. In this case the targeting computer was instructing the missile where to look based the radar lock. Or at least that's the DCS F16 symbology which is what this hud looks like but idk I do video games not fighter jets lol.
Not until Oryx starts counting Hiluxes.

Were there two drones splashed in this video? First one at :26?
How are we able to hear the bomb incoming before the blast? I would figure the bomb is flying supersonic.  Is it the airplane?
looks like it come from underground rather than from above
This is easy to fake
Anyone way smarter than me able to identify which beach this is?
maybe they stole the original plans from hamas - you *just never know* /s
monsters
Well it isnt really due to muslim solidarity so much as if we are too distracted with our muslim insurgency, we would be too bogged down to seriously threaten Sabah.
There‚Äôs a lot of you that are going to be shocked when you see just how refined and developed these tunnels are.
They had a nation way before that, you can‚Äôt force a country to give a piece of its land to the jewish, only they did did that with guns and killing, Palestinians didn‚Äôt have a (no) option they had a (yes or get killed) option
That man was straight New York City boi I love my city
[Watch something like this.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xtd6UOaEYwE&amp;t=2s)I don't know what missile he shoots, maybe an AMRAAM or a Sidewinder.Numbers on the left = Speed in Knots Top = HeadingRight = Altitude Center = PitchSmall bar in the middle with 5 &amp; 10 is probably the distance to target in NM. And the lower number might be the relative speed.
Doesn‚Äôt matter what side you‚Äôre on‚Ä¶ innocent people are dying. And that‚Äôs wrong on both sides.
&gt; probably have reassuranceI mean a couple of American carrier groups should be reassurance enough,
Welp, by the numbers there's only one that stands out. Down vote if you want. Or Google it idc.
Yes, but lets hope the best for the children who were born into this shithole full of hamas dogs. Nobody but esspicially children should not suffer such a hell
Also it‚Äôs possible Saudi Arabia was the target either or a good shoot down for public relations between the us and either country
It's a big raid, offensive coming in a few days
They could have shared TikTok dance footage too, just saying‚Ä¶
My grandpa was a photo-reconnaissance P-38 pilot who flew over Normandy leading up to and during d-day. I always wonder if he took these pictures when I see photos like this
They‚Äôre not trying to conduct a war they are just trying to kill as many Jews as they can.
You can bomb stuff from the air all you want it can't substitute boots on the ground.  At some point the IDF will have to go in and clear Hamas out and with more than two million people in the enclave plus (intentionally) blurred lines between civilians and combatants it will get very ugly  very quickly.
They had an opportunity to get a nation of their own but they chose war over peace.Reading history helps with this stuff, not just reading any books.
Wild how quickly they‚Äôre getting intercepted. Still in their ascent phase.That or they‚Äôre just failing and exploding.
Thanks for serving my blood brother! Go back and squash some of these fucking Turds will ya?
The [EU's recent statement is here](https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/67627/20241027-european-council-conclusions.pdf) (part II for this conflict)It doesn't ask for a ceasefire, and it includes both language arguably arguing for one, and arguably arguing against one. Examples:&gt; The European Council strongly emphasises Israel‚Äôs right to defend itself in line with international law and international humanitarian law.and&gt; The European Council expresses its gravest concern for the deteriorating humanitarian situation in Gaza and calls for continued, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access and aid to reach those in need through all necessary measures including humanitarian corridors and pauses for humanitarian needs.

I mean you're going to tell a manager to stand up ? Did you ever see a manager not trying to get the best seat he can ?But seriously what do you think a meeting room will look like?
All I can think of is these interviews from Gaza with people screaming that they can‚Äôt take it anymore. News alert, you haven‚Äôt seen anything yet
Plus, they have the guildhall which has a mock up hulk from days gone. Is shit but how much more NCD can you get!
free malaysia!! democracy NOW!!
Why would they accept the deal, it‚Äôs their land and their choice, israel became israel by violent occupation, invading, stealing, killing tens of thousands and robbing, go read some books, i feel like I‚Äôm wasting my time ( the Palestine borders are from the river to the sea btw)

I get that Iran is involved, but how? That just raises more questions.
"Okay, we've taken painstakingly taken the steps of creating an entire room under this civilian hospital, deep underground and outside of the sight of the Israels.

Is it, what's the plan, what we doing?
this is a real mask off moment for the global muslim population. except pakistan, they've always been terrible.
in a minute im gonna litter the fucking floor with you‚Ä¶ amazing
the arab league was always behind palestine no matter what, and just bc people suported a more secular movement doesn't take the religion away from it, like it's happens very often for weird alliances to happen beacuse of a common enemy, you had fascist and communist fighting in china, you had japanese and indonisian fighting together vs the colonist, you had multiple countries helping the nazis because they hated russia more, this isn't uncommon and doesn't change how thepeople align, like people don't care about the personal beliefs of the rulers, they care about what they do&amp;#x200B;&gt;Authoritarianism thrives when the people have few options and are oppressed. Israel controls every aspect of life in palestine: The borders, the air space the sea, the ports, the tranfer of goods, the visitors.this is a really bad and honestly bad poor argument that was tried multiple times and always fell flat, authoritans rise beacuse people watn a strong ruler, it's why crisis create authoritanism, why defeated nations resort to it, and why rulers in europe were allowed to gain more and more power until the french revolution happened...this whole excuse of "but they were forced to" is so annoying, you hear it everytime, be it russia iran china korea you name it, someoen has an authoritan state? well it's definitly super unpopular and just about to colapse, trust megermans got authoritan because the jews bullied them the russians because the ukranians bullied them, the chinese because the japanese bullied them what else? at what point can we say that a nation turned authoritan because it's people wanted it or at the very least allowed it? this is the problem with the middle east, they turned very complacent specially to religious rulling which allowed the institutions to growpeople often ignore how radical of a difference and blood spilled there was in europe to separate the church and state and to bring democracy, it's not somethign that happens naturally as some believe, people tend to drift to authoritanism along history if nothing is done about it
Everyone wants there to be a "good guy" and a "bad guy" and it's leading to some seriously stupid takes online.
Its insteresting how if we go to 1948 we see how Palestinians started a civil war instead of accepting the border deal that passed the vote with bright colors.And palestinian groups have ever since resorted to attacks against civilians

Yeah, never saw what the IDF was doing in Gaza before the intifada? Shooting Gazans and beating them to death was an IDF pass-time. Full independence lmao? Having control of exports/imports, having an airport/control over your own airspace, having access to your own sea and control of your own borders, having your own power plant, having access to your own water. ‚ÄúFull independence‚Äù usually includes those things. Anyone who is remotely educated about this conflict would see Israel‚Äôs ‚Äúdisengagement‚Äù for the farce it was.
i still don't understand how people can go on how isnt' about religion and culture when the claimn of the arabs to the was the nakba, where palestinian left/were kicked out in mass after losing the israeli war for indepence... like this whole conflict starts as israeli thinking is their land and palestinians the same, ofc it's a mix of religious and national movements but both have the same endinglike you do realizer that when palestinian say it's land ofr the palestinians (and israeli the same) it's on basis of religion because it says in their book and their people lived there... like this is an old tired argument it's nothign new, it's jsut that in most of the west holy wars and ethnic wars went mostly extint

Israel doesn't care about the hostages anyway
Free every Palestinian political prisoner in Israel and free every Palestinian in Gaza from their Israeli-built concentration camp
By that logic, wouldn‚Äôt the message of taking them down be: ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt care about your kidnapped hostages‚Äù? It seems like we are all trying to justify atrocities by our side and make up things to be outraged by their side. I‚Äôd recommend just being on the side that wants neither side to commit atrocities.
Not much left so censor lol. But seriously, this was remarkably clear hud footage
It's the goddamn Taliban mountain all over again isn't it!
Israel has been doing that since 1948, like i said go read some history books, don‚Äôt just comment and decide who‚Äôs terrorist and who‚Äôs not by the last 3 weeks

This is one of the most New York videos I‚Äôve seen in a minute
I don‚Äôt think the view is that rare. I just think the toxic views are louder. I honestly don‚Äôt know a lot of people that think what Hamas did/is doing is ok and I don‚Äôt know a lot of people that think the body count the IDF is racking up is ok either.
I wonder how many more innocent children were in those buildings.
better believe it https://youtu.be/U0Hx5ka1FiA
Sure. But then Israel can't do anything other than attack Hamas in the civilian areas where Hamas operates and the end result is the predictable loss of civilian lives. We can just make factual statements and that's fine but you seem to be implying (to me at least) that because they can't do anything else, they shouldn't be knocked for doing it and I disagree - the answer is coming to the table to negotiate a peaceful settlement.
Hamas isn't stupid but they sure do think their supporters around the world are and those supporters think the rest of us are stupid. There is still tons of people on reddit who think Israel bombed the Gaza hospital and killed 500 people. Whenever you ask where are the 500 bodies? The new narrative is they were blown into thousands of pieces/atomized. So Israel dropped a bomb so big it disintegrated with hardly a trace 500ish people, but only burned a parking lot and left all surrounding buildings intact. Soooo it was huge yet it was gentle. And left no crater. Wow, I mean you got people swearing up and down this happened and Israel lies about everything. But when Hamas lies about the very laws of physics and evidence well its not a Jew saying it so it must be true.
It's around ~1100km to Eilat, Israel. They have Iranian supplied drones that can cover that distance.
They gonna be digging a lot of tunnels before the press tours begin if this sim isn't right.
As a Jew, these guys give me hope.  So much hope that there are still many good people with moral clarity, willing to speak up for Jews.  I really needed to see this.
&gt;"IDF offensive?!"Only to the Palestinians. *Ba dum TSSSS*
Where are you seeing this? Just checked and it's less busy than usual...
Exactly!! This is a free country you're welcome to wave Palestinian Flags just as much as you are to put up posters of missing Israelis
Yes
no, no, no the EU ask for a ceasefire how could they do it :-)
You're welcome to reply and challenge my points with facts or reality, I'm welcome to change if it makes sense.
LOL imagine being this deluded.
What can a ground operation achieve that something more surgical can't? No wonder the US are trying to dissuade them
Oh really? Israel gave Gaza full independence as a peace offering and you come and post that lie?
I didn‚Äôt say anything about whether or not their attack was justified.I am speaking to this farcical talking point of ‚ÄúHamas operates in civilian areas.‚ÄùWell, duh, Israel has not allowed Gaza to properly arm or defend themselves as a normal nation would. There literally are no other places in Gaza for Hamas to operate from other than civilian areas.Regardless of the right or wrong of their actions.
More than most of people in congress apparently
"A communications disruption could only mean one thing : invasion" -Star wars dude from Naboo or whatever it's called.
Eh I pick the side that any religion that has been perverted enough to make you kill others for their beliefs is a disgrace to humanity. Insert any religion you wish.
Based.
I understand your point - there is literally no way for Hamas to abide by the laws of war. However, the laws of war are clear among nations in the Geneva conventions and the other treaties - all forces have to abide by the laws or they forfeit the protections afforded to militaries. If the rule is that you get to do whatever you want because its what is expedient or militarily beneficial, then what's the point of the law? If you believe that Hamas is justified in their attacks (I'm not saying you are, its an honest question) then do you believe that Israel gets to ignore the laws of war as well and use weapons that have been banned - like white phosphorus?
The second the dude closed his eyes I could FEEL the swing coming. Homie legit pulled him right out of those charges.

I mean something was obviously wrong from the moment they founded the nation on the basis of the superiority of the Malay race. Like Malaysia operates a legitimate affirmative action apartheid system. It's not great. This is also why Singapore is so well armed.
Good shot!
Surprisingly, not Haram.
i liked how he pretty much told him keep supporting your cause but dont fuck with theirs either. Respeck
What? Israel routinely breaks ceasefires. America got their back so they just do what they want, no biggie
Bust what?
That dude look scared as fuck lol like it was the first time he‚Äôs ever been confronted for being an asshole
Really don't understand how people think the second wave of explosions are secundaries. The explosions happen in exactly the same pattern, timing and fashion as the first wave. Only difference is the smoke from the first wave obscures the vision a bit.The bombs they're dropping can penetrate a meter of concrete, deep enough to send the blast upwards in a narrow collumn. Doesn't mean it has hit a tunnel.
Nothing ever happens bros... It's so Joever

Palestinian resistance groups have been notoriously secular in the past. A great number were marxist. The rise of islamic extremism is a recent thing. This is  not to be confused with the rise of nationalism.&gt;because since it's a state has been on and off trying to destroy israel and judaism...This is a factually poor statement. Firstly Israel doesn't recognise palestine as a state.  This is why settlers still steal land in West bank to this day. Secondly palestinians pre israel included Christians, Muslims and Jews. Pre the Aliyahs that started in the late 19th century, they all got along relatively well (not perfectly but well enough). &gt;Hamas is popular and have the people following them, Authoritarianism thrives when the people have few options and are oppressed. Israel controls every aspect of life in palestine: The borders, the air space the sea, the ports, the tranfer of goods, the visitors.
Cell service is also down, tanks have crossed the wall in multiple locations, heavy fighting in beit hanounIt‚Äôs goin down esse

Blessed be these New Yorkers.
Well said my friend. Too many people need this advice today.
Ya I don't think anyone would have a problem with putting up additional posters showing the Palestinians killed in the airstrikes. Let's show the innocent people harmed on both sides.But tearing down photos of kidnapped children, wtf?

Hear hear
No cease-fire until Hamas is militarily defeated or crippled for decades. Hamas will not abide by any cease-fire because the political leadership does not have control over its military wing or the PIJ. They will continue to fire rockets at civilians. Hamas will use the cease-fire to dig in and rearm. Israeli civilians will continue to die. A cease-fire means that Israel will sacrifice its own civilians for Palestinian civilians.
There is plenty of images and articles [here](https://www.google.com/search?q=f16+hud+explained).  The majority refer to games but should be very close to real life.
Sometimes, a New Yorker gets the point across, as simply as need be. He told ole dude, you are free to do what you want, but don‚Äôt infringe on our rights to do what we want. Somewhere, somehow, a lot of that got lost on modern society. If I‚Äôm offensive, sorry, deal with it. If you‚Äôre offensive, I‚Äôll deal with it. Putting on your big boy/girl pants every freaking day needs to happen. I chuckled when what‚Äôs her name said ‚Äúget a helmet‚Äù. Well, it rings true, tho. Life isn‚Äôt going to be served on a silver platter. Sometimes it‚Äôs on paper plates and Solo cups. Gotta tough it out.
man is right
Good thing they do not have torpedo-boat drones, else free trade around that area is over..
That guy sounds like the quintessential New Yorker, I wouldn‚Äôt mess with him
Be careful what you say, you have a *lot* of oil.  If North Dakota is anything to go by you would suddenly have a mass migration and the majority of the population would be white guys named Todd.

Maybe, but I dont think so because at this point, that's hamas only leverage.
I think people forget that 30 Americans were slained over in Israel. And the New York still remembers the loss of American lives. I imagine why the bald man was so heated.

So if they are going in then they probably have reassurance that neighbors don't have any funny ideas while they clean up the gaza strip.
HBO's idea behind the 3 I think was BoB shows the camaraderie and leadership in war, Pacific shows the horror and brutality, GenKill shows the monotony, boredom, and inefficacy of command.
Yes, most countries have a governmental body that‚Äôs dedicated to that but we are again talking about releasing footage to the public which is not something that is needed for an investigation nor is it needed for accountability. What is needed for this conversation is for you to answer the question I asked. What do you call what Hamas did?  Is that a war crime? If so why do they deserve any protections from the rules they themselves violated?
Exactly. He doesn't give a fuck as long as your not fucking with anyone elses rights.
I guess it depends if the rocket is on fire or not
Remember misfiring rockets have never killed a single Palestinian ever
Exactly this
Because it shows that Isreali citizens *are* vicitims of war and terrorists who seek their total annhilation for religious reasons. It shows that maybe, just *maybe* Hamas and the powers that be in Palestine aren't just interested in having their country recognized.
God I love New Yorkers
Israel is pure evil
Make sense, an artist I'm following who's from there keeps promoting Hamas and denying/justifying their war crimes. She also tells people to not watch western news and to watch Palestinian news networks or Al Jazeera, as if those weren't biased too. It's so sad because not a lot of people are calling her out and they all keep spouting the same stuff.
"Well you have video of it then"We have video of the results. The point of an investigation, which Reuters is asking for, is to understand how they were deaded. You don't just look at a murder victim and say "sorry" and walk away. There is an investigation by a third party. Do you support an investigation by a 3rd party into how these people were deaded?
To the core. This video made my day.
Yeah, they couldn't find anyone who fit the character just right so they got the actual marine. You know that opening scene where he's running with rocks in his gear? Yeah, he actually was doing that, and kept doing it for like 5 takes *10 years after he had actually done it*. Wasn't until they said he could stop that he admitted it was pretty fucking hard.
Well said
Well it was that 'successful' because the Israeli military let it... The Hamas attacks would have been entirely neutralized if Israel mobilized their army even if the attack was completely by surprise, they could have greatly reduced the number of casualties inflicted by Hamas
Imagine spending 20 years defending a country and not even knowing how to pronounce the name of it.
Also, ‚ÄúThat guy might be Jewish, I don‚Äôt know‚Äù killed me.
&gt;how can you say that when they have declared multiple holy wars by now? seriously... also which palestinians are you refering to exatly? because since it's a state has been on and off trying to destroy israel and judaism...Religion used to be much less of a factor than it is now. Violent non-state actors from the region in the 60s and 70s were much more secular than today and there was a greater political/ethnic/material basis for their campaigns.   Over the past few decades, fundamentalist movements have supplanted secular ones (with help from Tehran and Riyadh). The religious element now seems to be either the largest or second largest factor in most campaigns. Also, because the nature of the motivation has changed, the type of attacks have changed - attacks used to focus more on political/diplomatic impact and less on killing large numbers of unarmed civilians.*Caveat: This does not mean religion wasn't a factor, just that it was less of a factor. This also does not mean that the earlier, less religious groups didn't kill civilians - they did - it just means that their attacks tended not to focus on killing civs above all else.*
And they said it's not the full ground invasion.
Not to the two parties involved in this 3000yr plus bullshit war.
They certainly want rid of those tunnels. In fairness they told everyone to get the fuck out and now they see why.
Glad to see that New Yorkers still be New Yorkers warms the heart.
The range of the Quds 3 cruise missile is unknown but it's believed to be around 2000km and they probably use other Iranian cruise missiles. As for drones the infamous Shahed 136 has a range of 2500km

So true. In plain language and with total conviction. I fucking love New Yorkers!
Could you, maybe, try that comment again.... but this time in English?
Well you have video of it then. I don‚Äôt believe a true accident is considered a war crime and I‚Äôm sure they would review the footage as part of any investigation they do as far as accountability goes but we‚Äôre talking about releases to the public. If that kind of an accident is a war crime what do you call  storming across the border and burning children alive?
God I love New Yorkers.
Iran will be happy to fight to the last Palestinian.

You can see video of the strike [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/177134j/reuters_journalists_live_streaming_from/). Luckily he died [instantly](https://www.reddit.com/r/war/comments/1774lpq/reuters_journalist_killed_by_israel_in_lebanon/). The female reporter screaming "I cannot feel my legs" lost her legs. They were in the open and had repeatedly reported their position to the Israeli army. They were clearly identified as press and had Press written on the top of their vehicles. "mistook the journalists for Hezbollah"That is a war crime? Either you don't have proper identification (war crime) or you shot them purposefully. You cannot shoot at unidentified targets and call them Hamas. That is 100% the problem. "If that‚Äôs the one you‚Äôre talking about idk why they need to release video of it."Because family members of the deceased would like to know what lead to the decision for the Israeli military to dead their loved ones. Basically accountability should be expected. What level of accountability is fair given the situation?
Gazans were getting fucked over way before Hamas came along.

The false equivalence from people in the west is nauseating Where are the widespread pro-Israel protests that are chanting anti-Israeli slogans and glorifying the deaths of Palestinian civilians? Which university campuses do you have student groups spreading hate towards Palestinian students? Where are the mosques and Palestinian residences that are being defaced or attacked?The answer is that none of the above has been prevalent, it would be hard to find a few such incidences. Now reverse all of that, and the number of incidence is in the thousands.
Yep wave your flags chant your chants but you cannot wreck and trample over other people having their own causes

nationless behavior
Personally I think they are forcing Hamas to reveal their positions.  But each incursion will be bigger and stronger.  Attrite the enemy.
They‚Äôre all dead. But you can look it up
Nice job, it‚Äôs difficult to keep things peaceful and respectful right now, but at least these guys are trying.
So ALIVE! This city is
I post videos from Palestinians in r/Palestine. I think people dont want to be called anti-Semitic. Frankly, this is about the whole section of cities leveled since they declaredwar against ‚Äúhuman animals‚Äù you should see r/worldnews. They are deleting dozens(not exaggerating, click on any palestine/israel post) of comments in favor of Palestine, claiming it‚Äôs promoting terrorists.

Ofc you're gonna be down voted. You've mentioned children that actually died.I mean this rocket's accuracy is shit. But the JDAMs Israel uses, they mean to kill children.
In truth, he fucked them gopher tunnels up.....
The die was cast Oct. 7th.  Yup.
&gt; IDF is scum aswell lets be realYou mean the military force that transformed itself from a milita to the most advanced military in the world capable of launching precision strikes solely for the reason of reducing civilian casualties while  Hamas is still launching modified grads out of the back of ambulances?Also is this your alt or you forgot to switchover?
How?  Because people who hate them are going to still hate them?  LOL. This is a war for survival.  This ain't no fucking game of rhetoric in your college classroom.  This is serious shit.
It looks peaceful. But the message is: "These missing people are why we commit atrocities. Please let us continue."
This is Forest Hills, in Queens, those posters are everywhere..
The oppressor is Hamas.  The oppressor is Iran (the Gov't there, the people are largely alright).Up is down and down is up for some of you Hamas apologizers.
Poor innocent people
Imagine not being from Texas, where you are taught to shoot in elementary school. &gt;!I started shooting .22s in like 4th grade.!&lt;
 these terrorist groups don't pop outta nowhere, once Hamas is finished the Palestinians in the Gaza Strip will form another group and support it.  they are supported by the people there, believe it or not, a terrorist dying is considered a martyr to them.  it is considered an honor to be a terrorist, and a bigger honor to die a terrorist
You are right but they dont like that here. Incredible.
That cutter is coming on strong with a bone in her teeth!
That's not true. That's misinformation.

Pentagon pizza meter also going offStrap in boys
I worded it that way because the people ripping these posters down just see this as Israeli propaganda, but it‚Äôs far more than a Jewish problem. I completely agree with you that it is a humanity problem.
Wait, wait, wait. Are you saying that these are the ideals the people of Gaza voted for when they voted for Hamas in 2006?
Bro wasn‚Äôt wrong. It‚Äôs not ok. To be pulling this down. Yeah, there‚Äôs zero chance any of us are going to ‚Äòfind‚Äô those missing kids. Yeah it‚Äôs an emotional plea for alliance with the state of Israel, using those poor missing kids and adults. But those posters should stay. We can legit feel sorrow for those lost and those missing/kidnapped. And we don‚Äôt have to buy into the right wing extremist Likud-Bibi government, that both enabled and funded Hamas and also who were asleep at the switch when the Hamas terrorism was perpetrated. We can be smart enough to see both harms clearly. But don‚Äôt go tearing other peoples shit down. That was wrong. As bad as that liar Israel apologist attorney out front of the NY college this week, talking down to the students and misrepresenting what the students were protesting- about the additional, inappropriate harms that Israel continues to level at innocent Palestinian civilians.Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right. Multiple wrongs also don‚Äôt make any sense. Let‚Äôs be on the side of the people, not their bad governments.
Someone repost that other one from a couple weeks ago where the terrorists ended up in the water?
Not sure what to tell you. If you‚Äôre talking about the ones in south Lebanon I thought they claimed that strike and basically said they mistook the journalists for Hezbollah. If that‚Äôs the one you‚Äôre talking about idk why they need to release video of it. As for countries releasing footage some they will and some they won‚Äôt. There‚Äôs some government person that screens it and decides if it should go to the public. It‚Äôs not like they can press a ‚Äúrelease all footage‚Äù button so what they do release its going to be for some particular reason or from a leak. They‚Äôve been watching Gaza but they aren‚Äôt going to release all the evidence they have of Hamas operations because that would expose anything from secret surveillance techniques to a human source so to some extent you just have to decide if you want to trust the guys that have the UN on their ass and the US giving them weapons with all their legal rules and required evaluations/export regulations or do you want to trust the guys that burned children alive and took hostages  in a surprise raid and claim they‚Äôre running out of fuel while still launching rockets at Israel. The same guys that tried to claim they didn‚Äôt kill any civilians 10/07 when there‚Äôs multiple hundreds of hours of verifiable footage of them doing exactly that. Kinda just gotta go with your gut feeling I guess.
or by setting up a Mediterranean beach resort. Could legit be like the Cancun of the middle east.  You can't fix stupid.Famous Israeli  saying: The Palestinians never miss and opportunity to miss and opportunity.
&gt;It's not that religion isn't a factor, but Palestinians traditionally weren't particularly religious.how can you say that when they have declared multiple holy wars by now? seriously... also which palestinians are you refering to exatly? because since it's a state has been on and off trying to destroy israel and judaism... also as you said israel funded didn't create the same way the US and USSR did during the cold war, they provice and fund existent movements very rarely does a country start a movement on a foreign country, the only that comes to mind was the US attempt to overthrow cuba during the crisis where they did try to start a coup from a pretty non existent movementHamas is popular and have the people following them, this is no mystery, anyone that honestly says otherwise either has steak in the game or just doesn't know how authoritan states work
it almost sounds like a rumbler from a police car going off at the very end, that may have been why he did that
Yeah according to idf spokesperson this isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúTHE‚Äù ground invasion, so probably an incursion like last night
You bring shame to the corgi name, but remember when Hamas said the hospital was leveled by only the force of an Israeli bomb? Then we find out the shell hole is 6inches deep? Poor girl, stop supporting terrorism.You don‚Äôt see American military bases being placed under hospitals?
Python more likely

This guy understands the values of our country better than nearly. You're free to wave your flag and support your cause, but respects others for doing the same.
Hamas is still trying to kill Israelis so whatever it takes.  I know my country would do the exact same.  Any country would.  Hamas can surrender right now.
we should nuke malaysia
I'm Maidstone so gotta be close too
Yup.  I think the whole thing is sad.  They are getting suckered by Shia Iran that is just using Sunni Hamas to create chaos in the Sunni Arab world.  Egypt hates Hamas.  Jordan hates Hamas.  But the Palestinian people think going with Hamas and slaughtering women and children is the right strategy.  So much self inflicted death and destruction.
Oh no I call people that target civilians explicitly terrorists.Just like Hamas does, also calls for the death of all jews in their charter.The difference is that Israel atleast tries to warn civilians to evacuate and aims at militants.Thats the problem with Hamas hiding behind civilians and not wearing uniform.I also never paraded a dead Palastinian body, or celebrated the death of innocent Palastinians unlike Palastinians do with Israelis.Israel isn't perfect but its for sure better than Hamas.
Are you seriously comparing Gaza to an American city?
Seeing the children‚Äôs crib in the next room was just an awful view/inside understanding to the reality of this heinous garbage.
Why does a comment have to be made ‚Äúmore than just Jews‚Äù?  Are we not all humans?
Finally something on here that is showing humanity and not bootlicking terrorists.
Well yes actually. I would prefer if the IDF didn‚Äôt bomb them if that means thousands of civilians will die in the process. How many civilians deaths would it take for you to say it‚Äôs enough?
It's not that religion isn't a factor, but Palestinians traditionally weren't particularly religious. The PLO for example was secular and a good chunk of palestinians used to be Christian and Jewish (about 500K Christian palestinians now live in Chile for example). Jewish palestinians were absorbed into the israeli state. That said, Israel decided to fund a religious extremist arm of the Muslim Brotherhood in gaza, and this became Hamas. Israel, and Netanyahu in particular, have played off hamas versus the WB government to prevent there being a unified palestinian govt. And **now**, it's a religious war on top of everything else.
&gt; It‚Äôs people going way too hard on the Palestinian side, to the point of not having humanity for others.I agree with your comment, but it's worth pointing out that the exact opposite attitude is just as common and problematic. Everyone wants to pick a side and act like the atrocities committed by the other side somehow justify their own side's atrocities.
In the field where the bodies are burning, war machine keeps turning
That‚Äôs a fucking New Yorker right there. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not Jewish, he‚Äôs not Jewish, idk about him, but it doesn‚Äôt fucking matter.

Only mistake Israel made was letting hamas live for that long. Today this is gonna change
IDF is not playing games this time around. I think it will come in stages though.  Gradually squeeze.
You kill people and then call them terrorists, this is why israel is a terrorist organization
He literally still had a scrap of a poster in his hand.
Do you have any articles on the Malaysian government sponsoring terrorist groups? I'm curious to learn more.
For what it‚Äôs worth, you‚Äôre just not seeing the footage that‚Äôs out there, however little of it may exist. Consider where you get all your media from, anything relatively pro Russian here never makes it out of new. If you browse by controversial, you‚Äôll occasionally see precision Russian strikes likewe‚Äôve seen from IAF
They knew Israel has a policy of killing 20 Palestinians for every 1 Israelis killed. Which is fucked for both sides.
I want the brittish or even the dutch (not portugese) to retake this wasted potential of strategic land
You mean 6000 terrorists?Israel has already did this mistake with the Shalit trade and we don't need another Sinawar or some ugly ass terrorist like him free.
So it begins
True, they were sleeping at home when Hamas attacked and slaughtered them. And because of that they have also put all of the Palestinian civilians of Gaza in this misery and death.What exactly would you do if you were Israel? What exactly did Hamas think would happen?
honestly I'd rather be stateless, this country is just and embarrassment, cant even tell the difference between Hamas, ISIS, and actual Palestinianscommenter addon: seeing this and being minority does make concern me ALOT, as much as I have the knowledge to make blackpowder to really crude defence weapon, the best case scenario is to NEVER use that knowledge to defend myselfcant wait to see what stupid insensetive headline will be on tomorrow's news, bet it's right wing friendly which make me puke
They haven't released the video of the strike on the Reuters journalists.Strange how they can release video/comms when it suits them. And in 0 cases where the IC / Civilians want them to. And I mean Gaza. Since Oct 7th they have been watching it like a hawk. They have 24/7 footage of the area. The only thing that hurts them is tall buildings. Which they are systematically destroying.
Here here
Woman are free, they can decide whatever collour headscarf they must wear.
It‚Äôs people going way too hard on the Palestinian side, to the point of not having humanity for others.Reminder that of those 200 hostages in Gaza are more than just Jews, but people from all around the world. Showing support for civilians on one side is not dog-whistling that the ones on the other side don‚Äôt matter. These are 2 unrelated ideas, and anyone with humanity knows civilians on both sides matter.Edit: When I chose to say there are ‚Äúmore than Jews‚Äù included in the hostages, I was trying to convey that this is more than just Israeli propaganda and the instinct shouldn‚Äôt be to help a certain group of people, rather help people who are needlessly suffering. Bad choice of words though I can easily see how that gets misinterpreted.
Down with people
Israel is making a huge mistake.
Those civilians didn't start anything...
Hamas imprisoned and killed anyone who dared oppose them. Gaza youth breaks out was crushed by them.
I absolutely love the design of this one. She's not just a girl with tank parts but actually is like a tank morphed into a human-like shape. Love the little details like the armor seams and rivets, tread feet, etc.. and the anime eyes are so cute!

I could listen to this all day!! Good job NY citizen
Okay. Show us the receipts. Which outlets and experts do you refer to? My source is the photo of the explosion site that Hamas posted.
Your source us a literal terrorist organization btw.Why arent you blaming the dead on the terrorist organization using these civilians as human shields?

my head also have similar question. how can they have much money to afford such technology
He forgot that Amerikeee was watching
I do love New Yorkers.
Red Sea huh... IDF v the world i guess
For reference, the places with the bright lights are medical facilities, the one in the back is close to path of the rockets if not directly in its path, hard to tell with the camera panning.
FREE 6,000 Palestinian prisoners in Israel
I mean haven‚Äôt they released some of it?  Videos of qassam lauchers they destroyed, all the videos of 10/07. but besides that I think you might be thinking of the West Bank. Israel hasn‚Äôt been in a position to set up cameras and shit in Gaza since 2005. I doubt they have it under that much direct surveillance. Certainly they do some but not as much as the bank.
And sometimes it‚Äôs a cactus not a dildo.
They did fire large salvos at the very start, 3000+ launches on the first day. Volleys of up to 150 rockets. But they don't have an infinite supply of rockets and launchers, plus it's been 3 weeks now and some launchers and rocket caches have been hit.On the other hand, firing even a small 10 rocket volley can potentially cause hundreds of thousands of Israelis to run to the shelter. Naturally, people don't really want to go out, so these assholes can still cause noticeable economic and psychological damage even with a small rocket volley.
I posted this elsewhere and am posting here again as it's relevant:The Hamas Charter (Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement) has some choice goals, including:* (literally) peace is not an option* Musilms are religiously obliged to help Hamas* The goal of Hamas is the total elimination of IsraelAlso some very long paragraphs that basically repeat the last 1000 years of antisemitic conspiracy theories (leaving out Blood Libel, weirdly).Basically, Hamas' goal, by their own words, is to destroy Israel and kill as many Jews as they can. Everything else places a very, very distant second, and the Charter makes no mention whatsoever of providing a homeland for the Palestinians, nor any mention of protecting non-combatants. Everything is allowed in pursuit of their goal.Which is of course why the press should be treating claims of civilian deaths in Gaza with much more scrutiny than they do. Hamas has no qualms about claiming hundreds of dead minutes after any incident, even when it comes out later that they were lying by an order of magnitude.You have problems understanding because you believe there is nuance that you're missing.  You're not.  In fact, it's not nuanced at all.
New Yorkers know how to talk man. Where I'm from people can barley string a fkn sentence together when confrontation comes around. It just turns into "fk you, fk that, dada"
Yeah, tabs syncing and stuff exists. Dont think it applies to private browsing, but im still paranoid about it lol
Look, obviously Jewish people are gonna get more empathy in the most Jewish city in the US. Can‚Äôt do anything about it ‚Äî it‚Äôs just human nature for people to care more about their own, or at least people whom they see as close to them ideologically or politically or what have you. Taking down those posters, as blatantly propagandistic as they may be, is going to piss people off. Are you trying to help the cause or are you just going to react haphazardly? Like other commenters here have suggested: why not follow their lead and post posters of Palestinians who are dead or missing? The number of posters would be overwhelming
Oh he did some groomin all right
Was waiting for a goodfella to step up and protect the papers protect the papers.
As an Israeli, absolutely agreed.
1) There are people that go to neighboring areas in America and commit mass murder. You are the mass murder capital of the world. 2) I have no idea what a 'townies' is,  but its not Apartheid. There are only a handful of places that have Apartheid. China and Israel are at the top of that list.
F-15!
ah, that's what it was!
From yemen? It like 2000km. Are they capable of covering this distance ?
We have townies in America also, but they don't go on to commit mass murder on populations of the neighboring areas.
Some still can get through and hit infrastructure
I love New Yorkers. This is why.
Instead of ripping them down they should post up posters of the thousands of Palestinian kids who‚Äôve died due to our tax dollars.

Afaik, a lot of their launchers are single use, and they're also launched remotely or on a timer.Not to mention that the biggest problem ultimately is that there's a fuckton of them. A small 10 rocket salvo can potentially send hundreds of thousands of Israelis to shelter, and it could be shot from one launcher.In 2014, during about 1.5 months of fighting, they've triggered 12,937 alerts in total. During this war, going on for 3 weeks now, they've triggered around 7700 so far. Obviously, the scale of IDF bombardment is downright biblical, but it still goes to show that if you spread hundreds upon hundreds of hidden launchers, even this level of bombardment is not enough.

&gt;"officials in Gaza say that 7,028 have been killed so far"officials in Gaza are members of Hamas, far from a trustworthy source. It's not the red cross reporting this number.The source for the rocket is also pretty bad, just a single munition expert, allegedly, whos claim is the opposite of other munition experts:\[[https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/21/middleeast/cnn-investigates-forensic-analysis-gaza-hospital-blast/index.html\]](https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/21/middleeast/cnn-investigates-forensic-analysis-gaza-hospital-blast/index.html])&gt;Eight weapons and explosive experts who reviewed CNN‚Äôs footage of the scene agreed that the small crater size and widespread surface damage were inconsistent with an aircraft bomb, which would have destroyed most things at the point of impact. Many said that the evidence pointed to the possibility that a rocket was responsible for the explosion.  &gt;  &gt;Marc Garlasco, a former defense intelligence analyst and UN war crimes investigator with decades of experience assessing bomb damage, **said that whatever hit the hospital in Gaza was not an airstrike**. ‚ÄúEven the smallest JDAM \[joint direct attack munition\] leaves a 3m crater,‚Äù he told CNN, referring to a guided air-to-ground system that is part of the Israeli weapons stockpile provided by the US.  &gt;  &gt;Chris Cobb-Smith, a British weapons expert who was part of an Amnesty International team investigating weapons used by Israel during the Gaza War in 2009, **told CNN the size of the crater led him to rule out a heavy, air-dropped bomb.** ‚ÄúThe type of crater that I‚Äôve seen on the imagery so far, isn‚Äôt large enough to be the type of bomb that we‚Äôve that we‚Äôve seen dropped in, in the region on many occasions,‚Äù he said.(**Bold** is my edit, not in the original article)also, all of the Israeli air strikes take down building or single apartment, they leave rubble behind, not a crater. I'm sure Israel has that type of ammunition(JDAM) but there is no evidence this type was used in any bombing as far as I'm aware. It would be very weird for them to only use it to bomb a hospital. And just because an explosion looks like a type of ammunition, is not proof it was used by either side. There is no proof any plane committed that bombing, but it did happen right along side a Hamas rocket launch.
Never been happier to see an angry New Yorker telling it like it is.
Most of the terrorist murderers who escaped their prison had never stepped outside Gaza in their life. Their entire life is 3 walls and an ocean. I think it is a much more complicated answer.
Like [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6HcaYiuCK8) ? Or  you just ate up pro-hamas aljazeera propaganda and other anti-israel sources (what a coincidence)?
One thing to take note of, Gaza has been in a severe state of dependance. They lack alot of ressources and probably the means to access it.Also, see it another way, lets say Israel is really targetting hamas fighters, wearing a military grade helmet might tag a civilian as a potential target to
Not this guy, he worked for Hustler magazine. They will make an exception
Israel has 24/7 surveillance of the Gaza strip right now. They tie it together to rewind time to see where Hamas terrorists come and go from. It would be great if they released all the justifications of the 2000 children that have been deaded so far.

Bro, have you seen the Western world in the past few weeks? Hundreds of thousands of people are marching for Palestine. You want to know what would happen? Exactly this. Some people put it up, some asshole tears it down.
How do the Houthis have cruise missiles and drones capable of traveling all the way from Yemen to Israel? Like that‚Äôs not an easy thing to do. Also what would they be using? Like does anyone know the type/ or model? I‚Äôd really like to know more.Edit: ALSO (sorry for so many questions) are we sure the ones that the US intercepted were heading to Israel? Aren‚Äôt the Houthis technically at war with Saudi Arabia?
Because Hamas isn‚Äôt restricted to one part of Gaza.
Jesus, wtf Malaysia. They went full retard. It's one thing to stand with the civilians of Palestine, it's another to fucking wear masks and wear the colors of fucking Hamas.
Hamas fired 8000 rockets last week. If you think those are peace and love rockets, you're stupid. Palestinian supporters try to attack feelings over the internet and innocent people in real life. You're not fooling anyone
Totally noncredible, the IDF has made their policy of killing journalists on sight extremely clear.
Yea they tried peaceful protesting their conditions and were massacred
&gt;People like you were pIf you truly believe that explosion was an airstrike, there's nothing to argue about.

major difference between "will release for a cease-fire" and "won't release without a cease-fire"They're essentially saying, give us a cease-fire and then well talk about hostages. Seeing as Hamas breaks cease fires regularly, I can see why Israel isn't playing directly into their hands with this one.What is your source for the American JDAM and the Gaza death count?
Oh I didn't google, I used the reddit search for the sub. Like I straight up copy pasted the term you used "Saabmisive and Swedable" into the reddit search and it was the first thing that came up. If you're having trouble with search terms in the future, pick the fewest unique keywords possible that you're confident are involved ("Saabmisive" and "Swedable" in this case are both extremely unique keywords so they're the best option), then plug those in to the platform you think is most likely to have it. If that doesn't return the desired result, either remove keywords one at a time to id the problem or if the results are too generic, add more related keywords. The specific issue here if you were using google is you spelled it differently, so keyword elimination would still get you there. Specifically,&gt;site:reddit.com Saabmissive SwedableDoesn't return it easily, but if you do system of elimination on the keywords (something I try to do whenever I don't know if I'm spelling something correctly), you get to &gt;site:reddit.com Saabmissivewhich pulls it up as the first result.

Hamas is going to get a large portion of Gaza destroyed. I will be amazed when the people of Gaza vote for Hamas to be their government of choice again.

I still think that was more intentional than anything they were warned multiple times I'm sure they had at least some intel for months They probably made the call to let it happen so they can invade gaza once and for all but probably also underestimated how much carnage would occur on the 7thIsraeli intelligence isn't dumb they wouldn't just let stuff like this happen
When object is outside POV of HUD they do stick together perfectly so to not clutter the HUD. And it only to shows the direction you need to reposition your nose for lock. Not sure about that one, could be simple delay between targeting and locking systems.

I can tell you. They will end up with dead friends and family, displaced, in more restrictive conditions, probably less land and a DMZ, and the world will forget about them in a month like it forgot about Iranians and Armenians ,North Korean, Uyghurs, Myanma, etc. It wasn't worth it at all.
Because its main function is propaganda. Instead of taking them down though, someone should put up some posters of missing/dead Palestinians, but I have a feeling those would be taken down even more. Would be interesting to see what happens.
Rome Statute duly noted - Four signatory states (Israel, Russia, Sudan, and the United States) have informed the UN Secretary General that they no longer intend to become parties to the Rome Statute, and as such have no legal obligations arising from their signature.  The process to establish the Court's jurisdiction may be "triggered" by any one of three possible sources: (1) a State party, (2) the Security Council or (3) a Prosecutor. It is then up to the Prosecutor acting ex proprio motu ("of his own motion" so to speak) to initiate an investigation under the requirements of Article 15 of the Rome Statute.

I come from Germany and when the big wave of refugees came, I thought it would be good if we helped them. I didn't see the problems, such as the hatred of us, their religion and the many crimes committed by these refugees. I only see how they put their Islam above all else with great aversion to those of other faiths. I see this horrific attack, I see this family, and my attitude changes. Islam is no longer a religion for me. It is a hollow shell that is only used to chase, murder and suppress.
reports say 2 rockets hit Sderot, no one was hurt
I was thinking exactly this since the behaviour of Iran in the aftermath of october 7th. On the other hand USAs several interventions had their part on the global situation right now. But for now, I really hope they would do something to empower the people of Iran to end the islamist dictatorship there.
&gt; Why is it bothering them so much?Because the posters remind people that Hamas isn't just a bunch of sweet and kindly freedom fighters who would never do a bad thing to anyone.
&gt;Hamas want‚Äôs a cease fire to allow for hostages to return but Israel won‚Äôt let up. Who knows how many hostages have been killed by Israel‚Äôs indiscriminate bombing.For all the hostages? A source for that would be interesting
Bar on the left should be speed, far right bar height, the bar a lil more to the left gives the distance to the locked target and 3 indicators which tell you max range, optimal range and min rage of the selected weapon (in this case propably an Aim-9). The bar at the top tells you the direction, the bar at the bottom which moves as the plane turns indicates the horizon.Edit: since Israeli planes are American models the values are most likely in knots and feet.
The US flag and the Malaysian flag are both ripped off from the British East India Company flag.
Ya that trend is idiotic. I‚Äôm pro-Palestinian emancipation. Doesn‚Äôt mean I have to hate Israelis or Jews. I just dislike their government and their treatment of Palestinians You should want the hostages returned as-well as a cease fire.

As someone who served in idf, negev is m249 just modified, special forces uses negevon which is shorter version, both use 5.56 round, we have mag as well which uses 7.62 but they are heavy and we don't like it so much, usually they are top of tanks of hummers.
Israel cant do that, they will just shoot from school, hospitals , near kids etc.. and wait for Israel to bomb them, they always used died citizen against Israel, all the wars in Gaza or Lebanon stopped because killed citizens and the world forcing them to stop
Nah bro it's all about material conditions. Hamas doesn't have a choice but to launch thousands of rockets at their neighbors because they can't import PlayStation 5's.

The explosion was big because it was an American JDAM that detonated before it hit the ground. Would you like me to send you the videos of these 3 year old ‚Äúfreedom fighters‚Äù with their heads, legs and arms ripped off? Thousands of those videos floating around on here. Gotten so bad that parents have to write their children‚Äôs names on several different parts of their bodies so that when they‚Äôre found they have something to identify them with. Or maybe you‚Äôd like to see the videos of IDF soldiers pissing on the burnt corpses palestinian men and children. 1300 jews killed by terrorists vs over 7,000 civilians killed in bombings (4,000 of which where children). Hamas want‚Äôs a cease fire to allow for hostages to return but Israel won‚Äôt let up. Who knows how many hostages have been killed by Israel‚Äôs indiscriminate bombing.
Why was that circle perfectly over hrr square in the beginning but offset quite a bit leading up to the missile launch?
Can these assholes stop taking down the posters. Why is it bothering them so much?
The problem is that when the US "goes home," nothing happens to us. When Israel goes home they're just counting down the days until the next suicide bombing, massacre, or rocket attack.
I remember an engineer saying they once weren't wearing their hearing protection while doing routine maintenance on an F/A-18 and accidentally triggered a sensor check (I think it was an RWS, to make matters worse). The cabin beeps made him deaf temporarily. Those are meant to be LOUD even wearing hearing protection, a huge helmet, having someone scream into your radio, firing the gun and the noise produced by going over the speed of sound. Taking that noise unprotected must be excruciating

I honestly am surprised that Israel doesn't have an automatic "counter battery" response to rocket launches. Gaza is such a tiny strip it's surprising there isn't constant total surveillance. Catching launches should be the easiest thing.Of course we know Hamas and friends shoot these from schools, hospitals, etc, so invariably the counter battery fire would likely be desired by these creeps.

That's what we in the biz call "Hamas's problem."
This was disproven by several independent news outlets and experts.What a coincidence that the countries you‚Äôre agreeing with are all pro-Israel. People like you were parroting weapons of mass destruction and yellow cake uranium 20 years ago too.
The Red Sea near Israel is rather narrow and surrounded by mountains, almost a fjord tbh. You can pretty much see Egypt, Jordan and even Saudi Arabia from Eilat (Israel).I think people don't really realise how small and cramped Israel is.
I tell you theres often a huge price to pay but the armed services people of this world get too see some truly magnificent and/or terrifying shit then your average civilian just won't ever even imagine
Lmao
They were thinking that they could benefit from a war with Israel. The concerning thing is whether Israel can manage to have a war with Hamas that doesn't achieve whatever it is thst Hamas set out to gain.More widely, this is part of the wider proxy war between Iran and the US, so maybe a bigger question is what Iran is planning - they seem to be getting bolder.
Or as granny used to say. The dildo of consequences rarely comes lubed.
PULL UP
Wake it up when September ends.
Being so far removed from war, these people see war through rose coloured glasses.Malay Muslims generally support the Palestinian cause not because of any humanitarian basis (They fucking hate refugees) but out of a religious commitment to a global Jihad against the Jews and the West. They dont support Palestine. They support Hamas. They love Hamas. The Malaysian government has been a known state sponsor of terrorism in Southern Thailand, Acheh, and Southern Philippines albeit very discreetly. Thats why terror attacks have occured around them but never exactly within the country proper. There is a growing movement of Islamism within the younger generation that seeks to harm the multicultural facet of the nation by effectively establishing a form of religious apartheid and greater role of the Shariah Court. Malaysia is trying to do a Pakistan and I dont think it can survive this process.

Doesn't mean anything. Iron Dome only fires interceptors at targets that are going hit in a populated area. So it doesn't fire at things that are gonna land in a farmers field.
Several independent nations have concluded that it was indeed a failed Hamas rocket and the death toll was in the dozens not hundreds.The irony of you calling me a propaganda believer is just incredible. Please use your critical thinking skills.

Israel is the terrorist. Everyone knows that. Don't worry your time will come.
They have training bases out in the open. Maybe, just maybe, if they had everything you just listed, millions would‚Äôve died in Israel on oct 7. I don‚Äôt know which hospital you‚Äôre talking about, but fyi, according to international law, if a hospital is used for military operations, it becomes a legitimate military target. Too bad they give zero fucks about the Gazan population.
You mean the hospital parking lot that got blown up by a failed hamas missle and then Hamas claimed it took 500 lives and morons like you believed them?
All of these points assume Hamas still exists in a major capacity after the war. Gaza could end up being a tent city-state filled with UN peacekeepers.
I wonder why they don‚Äôt launch like 50 of them at the exact same time. These small and sequential launches seem like a waste.

Look, I don‚Äôt care whether you want to believe your IDF propaganda numbers, considering that the IDF has a very bad credibility record as well, and [they said it themselves](https://x.com/saulstaniforth/status/1714537107320873347?s=46).The fact is, Israel is bad on the ground without their air force being very effective. They have lost every single exchange with Hezbollah ever since 2006, you lost another Brigade Commander in an exchange with Hezbollah recently. I'm not sure if you understand how bad that is..You got destroyed in Al Karameh battle and Battle for Jerusalem against Jordan because your air force couldn‚Äôt do much You got destroyed in 2006 against Hezbollah in a crazy odds war, again because your air force couldn‚Äôt really damage Hezbollah, they bombed civilians in other areas of Lebanon as a way of pressure (typical Zionist terrorism).You will get destroyed if you actually launch a ground invasion against Hamas, no army in the world can succeed in such a tunnels guerrilla war without losing 50k of their soldiers, and you‚Äôre too cowardly to do so.Btw, [Israel did launch an operation in Khan Yunis 5 days ago](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2023/10/22/%D9%82%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%88%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%AD%D9%89-%D9%88%D8%AA%D8%B9%D9%82%D8%A8-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%89-%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%B5%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A3%D9%88%D9%84), they fell into a [Hamas trap](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/amp/middle-east/1663969-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%AA%D9%83%D8%B4%D9%81-%D8%AE%D8%B3%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B1%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%83%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%85) and lost 2 bulldozers, a tank, a soldier and 2 others were wounded and the unit had to run back on foot, I'm not sure if you get this information or not, but probably not. I attached 2 sources, one is Hamas' story and the other is the IDF's.
Might be missing the point but what's being raided exactly ? Feels like those old isis vids where they shooting at air üòÇüòÇ
Maybe we can use that money meant for the chinese sub that was never delivered because the germans wouldnt give them the engines.
Head of the snake; at least Iran (s government) is currently bent on provoking the USA, maybe they will start something the Iranian people can finish and change the country for the better.
I mean how much elaboration do you want? Judaism was founded in the ME before Islam was founded, the region was literally called Judea by the Romans, then the Muslims came in and took over, then the Christians came and took over, then the Muslims came and took over, then the Christians came and took over, and so on. Eventually the Brits took the land from the Ottomans, split it how they wanted to, and the land was about 40-60 split between Jews and Muslims, which drastically changed as Jews from Europe immigrated in and Arab countries attacked and subsequently lost several wars in their attempt to wipe Israel off the face of the Earth. If we're playing the incredibly stupid game of "whoever was here first is the rightful owner", then it should probably go to the Babylonians or Hittites or Egyptians, but it sure as hell shouldn't go to the Muslims. The idea that the Jews are a colonizer when they have existed in the area for thousands of years is actually brain dead, and diminishes the complexity of the issue and how fucked up genuine colonizing actually was.
In the first moments of the video: that ricochet of the tracer off of whatever it hit on the coast. üëÄ
Would work as a nice excuse for Thailand to buy a squadron of F35 though, so I take this as a win.
Sure, name the military base in Gaza‚Ä¶.Or, maybe, just maybe, they‚Äôre forbidden to have an army, navy, Air Force, military installations by the people currently bombing them.Sick justification for bombing a hospital though.
As a Malaysian, I wouldn't mind if the US takes over Malaysia lol. Maybe they can do a better job at being the government.
Jesus christ, guys... turn that fucking racket down.
I mean, if I lived there I'd be bored out of my mind throwing rocks at whatever moved just to see what happens, so I guess I get it...
They all (Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis) take their orders from Iran.
South East Asia is doomed
Nazy (pronounced with a soft ‚ÄúS‚Äù) means beautiful in Farsi, so I agree, the raid was beautiful indeed!
Hatred for jews is drilling in Islam doctrines, so it's no surprise that these people are like this even if they never know or meet jews in their life.
Nah, too tame for it.  No people wearing flamethrower equipped steel angel wings
Ah fuck, this shit better not cross the border. The south of Thailand is already unstable enough as it is.
That's literally how every government has worked, ever. In the history of humanity. The fact that Palestinians had a choice at all for who represented them at some point is an actual improvement over most of human history. Nations choose a path, and the people pay the consequences. Do you think monarchs were dying in their wars of conquest, or the peasants and serfs and retainers? Do you think Jews chose to be born in Germany or Poland or Hungary? Do you think Rwandans chose to be born there? Or Armenians in Armenia? Minorities in Myanmar? And the Palestinians had a lot more agency in their future than those groups. Leaders are chosen with varying amounts of influence by the population, they make decisions that affect the population, and the population either lives with the results of those decisions or they implement new leadership. Welcome to the real world. If Palestinians in Gaza don't want to be represented by a terrorist organization on their affairs, then perhaps they should start putting some effort into removing Hamas from power. It's not fair, but it's reality, and it's not Israel's fault or problem. They have their own people to be responsible for.
Didn't the autobots bomb iran?

I was hoping this would one of those paragliders Hamas used. That would be pretty insane footage
Radar tracking and radar lock. Once pilot engaged radar locked object, it disintegrated and only radar tracking could be heard afterwards. Dings have to be very distinct and loud, because this video don't do justice on how loud jets are. If you interested, search on YouTube fighter jet sounds. There are many more warning sounds. New object, tracking, new contact, special contact, launch etc...
what happen to sunlight?  is this inside a cavern?
Where's the Palestinian resistance to hamas?

This thing looks really difficult
Are they roleplay Hamas in fucking school parade? FFS!?But when I realized that many Muslim countries support Palestine and Hamas in the same sentence. That is fucked up no matter what.
His life is over. That's the face of death.
holy shit buckle up guys
No worries!
And 15 years after that, and so on and onNeither hamas or the idf want a peaceful resolution, its just gonna be a cycle of revenge and hate for generations
hamas have no way of fighting this IDF dudes with no thermals.
Gotcha, just saw CNN report it as well

the ammount of times i heard that it has nothing to do with religion and only politics is insane, like this is kinda true if you look at israel as the only actor in this war kinda like how commies look at russia and ukraine as 1 entity and 1 rebilious partwhen people realise that yes palestinians also have their will and their wants it does turn into a religious war
I actually don‚Äôt know about that anymore.  The explosions are all uniform and the same size.  People saying the explosions are venting out of access points‚Ä¶who the hell has a dozen access points in that small area?  Seems more like a demolition job or deep penetrator.  Although I‚Äôd expect to see more dirt come up if that was the case
WAIT WAIT WAIT, WHO THE FUCK PUT OPTIMUS PRIME IN THE PARADE? LMAO
Looks like i was right.
Hamas
This is from HUD camera used for debriefing, not a sensor that pilot can use. They actually just look like shit. 768x494 NTSC video.
Fair. And, TBH what do I even know??? But it seems that over the decades there would be more of a ‚Äúbunker down‚Äù protocol using everything they had. But I am 100% ignorant and someone with facts can probably tell me why I‚Äôm wrong
Jihad
"well, I don't know what I expected..."
I think everyone in the defined borders of Israel should vote on what happens to everyone in the country, and stick to the results, whatever they are.
Thank you for that. I heard the audio of the Hamas guy who called his parents and he sounded like he was on a whole lot of some kind of speed.
Take a look around the next Von Neumann is somewhere in this video
The Hamas Charter (Covenant of the Islamic Resistance Movement) has some choice goals, including:* (literally) peace is not an option* Musilms are religiously obliged to help Hamas* The goal of Hamas is the total elimination of IsraelAlso some very long paragraphs that basically repeat the last 1000 years of antisemitic conspiracy theories (leaving out Blood Libel, weirdly).Basically, Hamas' goal, by their own words, is to destroy Israel and kill as many Jews as they can.  Everything else places a very, very distant second, and the Charter makes no mention whatsoever of providing a homeland for the Palestinians, nor any mention of protecting non-combatants.  Everything is allowed in pursuit of their goal.Which is of course why the press should be treating claims of civilian deaths in Gaza with much more scrutiny than they do.  Hamas has no qualms about claiming hundreds of dead minutes after any incident, even when it comes out later that they were lying by an order of magnitude.
They already had invaded parts of Gaza.  Last night they started a sea raid on a beach in Gaza and landed some troops to destroy terror infrastructure.
I bet you're really fucking fun to hang out with at parties.
Yeah clever idea‚Ä¶facepalm
Man Yemen really wants to be the most war torn country in history; why are they (Houthi's that is) getting involved when they already are fighting multiple parties?
Ah, thank you.My friends told me that it was over the Negev.I appreciate it.
Have they tried that?If not, how can you know?
It says in Hebrew this is over the Red Sea. No reason for the Yemenis to go all the way into the Negev when there are military bases and port city much closer to them.
Are these Hamas rockets we‚Äôre seeing or Iron Dome interceptors?
Too soon
I lost it when I saw that. Optimus Prime was purposely designed to represent the USA and Megatron old world views of Japan by the creator. He‚Äôs fucking red white and blue for fucks sake. Did they think he was Malaysia?
By the book
That's a ridiculous ask to have them posted here.They'd be posted to the War Thunder forums.
Tbf the explosion was pretty big... because it probably blew up a weapons cache, which was near a hospital..."Freedom Fighters"
No, your argument is invalid to the point where it‚Äôs not even worth commenting on. If you seriously believe ‚ÄúThey were here before muslims and the Islamic religion and therefore it‚Äôs their land‚Äù. Ok? King Cyrus allowed Jews to return to their homeland after the conquest of Babylon. So by your logic the land also belongs to the Persians, at the end of the day if age is the only thing that matters, not religious, or cultural significance to the land I guess also the Greco Romans are entitled to almost half of Europe, because they were ‚Äúthere first‚Äù.
The actor who plays Fruity Rudy isn't just an actual Force Recon Marine, *he literally is Fruity Rudy!*

Lol comments are amazing. All of them, who wrote the comments, killed or discriminated the other side without any reason.
It's weird. In Israel everyone was like WTF, Hou this?
A lot of the aid is for Iron Dome replacement, they have been using a shit load for three weeks straight
Hamas is Sunni, just like al-Qaeda, IS and all their offshoots and affiliates - most of them view Shia and Alawites as apostates that deserve the same treatment as infidels.  Hezbollah is a Shia outfit.

Plot twist: new CCP method to increase declining birth rate.
How about living in reality?Best way to stop a war is to never start it.As for a ceasefire, havent heard of hamas begging for forgiveness yet on Israel. But i sure heard they love to hide behind civilian structures and infrastructures.
F-15 HUD for sure. top middle horizontal scale is heading.  Left scale is speed in knots. though exact speed indicator is blurred speed is around 350knots.Far right scale is angels or altitude in feet.Inner right scale is missile launch zone in Nautical mile 10 and 5 mile markers with a dynamic carrot on the left the carrot number also indicate what I think is closure rate. the 3 small bars on the right of the launch zone are dynamic launch zones, top one is Range Max, no escape zone or NEZ and range minimum. you can see it dynamically changes as the target interception goes from head on to tail chase. This was a very close shot, between the circle indicator on the radar lock box and the scale of 10miles on the DLZ most possibly an IR missile shot. what's most interesting is the speed of the target, in the head on before the merge target was closing in at ~680 knots while aircraft was doing 350ish, making the target speed ~310knots range. in the tail on before the shot which is much cleaner for estimating speed since they were in line "velocity vector being more stable" my estimation the target was going 285knots range or 527kph 327mph, that's fast for a drone, not remotely impossible but its up there .
Cool view
0:06, wonder what that one is going to hit...
I have so many similar shots from Ukraine that I hope to see them when the F16s arrive.
Land of hot wheels is now hummus Territory? :(
The HUD and the noises and the alarms always make pilot FPV videos really hectic/chaotic. It would be cool to learn what everything means.
And? what's so unfortunate about that? future Hamas soldiers
**CONSUME AND REPRODUCE**
&gt;No. They are high on the hatred of Jews.Not only, Captagon too
With the 60s audio to boot
&gt;did Hamas load these guys up with some type of (meth)amphetamineActually yes, they used captagon - it's all documented - look it up

To add, I'm not sure they could do anything to improve Chatham except delete it from the planet.Last time I checked I've got family there and it would be great if they got deleted as well.
I guess they should have warned them to evacuate first right?
Unprecedented strikes, earthquakes have been felt in Ashkelon because of them, 22 km from the Gaza strip.All internet and cellular infrastructure has been destroyed as well, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if it marks the start of the ground operation.
U.S.A.D.D.A.M.
Citizens in the Israeli south report the ground shaking due to the current bombing in Gaza. Most significant air attack in a while. From Gaza Now:&gt;Urgent: Very violent bombing on various parts of the Gaza Strip now.. A bombing that Gaza has not witnessed since the beginning of the aggression üáµüá∏&gt;Urgent: Complete disconnection of communication and the Internet from the Gaza Strip üáµüá∏Massive artillery barrage reported aswell, this might be it.
Love seeing tracers at night, monkey brain think it look like star wars
Seems the title it's Misleading.
Thanks! That‚Äôs what I was asking.
This is F-15 HUD. Unless you're asking about the target, which was most likely a drone.
One failed Houthi Drone (which was scheduled for Israel) wounded 6 civilians in Egypt. So, Egyptian and Israeli coordination in the Red Sea is very plausible now.
Yeah, and destroyed 2 kinder garden.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not politically motivated! I am too stupid to find another route I swear!‚Äù
So...why does Isreal need military aid from the US? They literally have every advantage possible
And how'd that work out? No, seriously, I'm ootl.
1- it would make MORE MONEY since they supported at the start to control Gaza2- they are simple minded since they are controlled by people that live in Qatar and their militia get constantly killed more and more until they replace it with new indoctrinated people. Look at the percentage of adult men and children in Gaza and tell me being part of Hamas works out.Their leadership is literally pushing Israel to destroy all Gaza and make Palestinians run away from their homes, what do you think is going to happen even if Israel goes all-in?They remove money from Israel? Stop supporting them? And then what?That's a no plan from a simpleminded such as Iran/Russia and all the other autocratic countries that believe this will destroy the west anyhow. Logic and critical thinking don't work for autocratic countries and sometimes it doesn't even for democratic ones too, what matters is the security issues that each country has and no one is going to contest Israel on this besides strong words.
2 were intercepted by Egyptian jets over the Sinai and this one was intercepted by the IDF over the Red Sea. Likely another combined assault of Samads and cruise missiles. All this does is force Egypt and Israel to cooperate to ensure the Red Sea's security. Houthis will make Hamas lose its key agent for mediation.
Ask for a source. Don't say something that sounds iffy otherwise, you are implying that person is lying - you know what why I'm wasting my time with such a low IQ'd
These kids will grow to be great doctors and scientists.
 Pretty sure they don't think past "Kill Jews". I would have thought they were trying to rope Israel into doing something that would be strategically advantageous to them, but seeing them have no counter to having their buildings turned to chalk made me realize Hamas isn't thinking strategically.
Idk dog but extremists aren't really known for rationality.
USA! USA! U...S...a... hmm, wrong crowd.
Nowhere does the original comment say anything about just in Israel/Palestine. In fact it says world wide news.
Probably the goal is to do so...like  before
/s There you go.
I have been watching the IDF bomb Gaza for over 10 years. These explosions are very common, and are not indicative of a secondary, its the way the bombs are fuzed in conjunction with hitting a subterranean structure that causes the distinct vertical plume.
Do we know what plane it was?
?
Obviously, these figures are worldwide. Only a fool would think that 1,699 journalists had been killed in Israel. You lack the honor to say, my mistake
It's deliberate obfuscation, you don't want your enemies to know how good your visuals really are.
The real Eric Kocher is also in it, he plays someone else though.
Malaise era Optimus.
hey good question.  my point is I want a legitimate scope of the attack that has been used to justify the response.  News outlets and social media have consitently run information around the globe that is given to them by the IDF.  The IDF has lied a million times over about injustices.  Just like I dont want to get my information from the CIA, Hamas, or any other military agency. Google Shireen Abu Akleh if you want a recent example, but it doesnt take much digging. for instance, the massacres of the Kibbutz.  I can definitely see Hamas raided, murdered, took prisoners, all terrible crimes against humanity.  However, what I can glean is that IDF forces also went into those towns and fought Hamas to take them back.  There was a several day period, (again from my understadning, i could be wrong), before foreign press was allowed to go in and see what had happened, with information about the attack being given to them by an IDF general.  In the meantime, we hear reports of rape, beheaded babies, etc.  I think it is important to know more about those claims to be honest as much as I really dont want to know.  You have to remember as an american and Arab/Muslim, Propoganda about the savagry of arabs has been used to justify slaughter. And Lastly, as a palestinian-American, please remember I have been there (Not to Gaza, but Isreal/west Bank).  Somehow, Palestine is the most heartwrenching and beautiful place I have been to.  In terms of "researching the ongoinging conflict,"  Im pretty versed.  No one can argue away and obfuscate seeing apartheid on the ground.  Its sick, its immoral, its settler colonialism.  And I will not accept that Palestinians living in Diaspora, of which I am a part of, are somehow illogically genociadal.  Palestinians throughout the world are very educated and successful.  We have lower crime rates per capita than most of the places we live.  I will not accept that we cant walk and chew gum and should be akin to animals like so many IDF let slip on the airwaves to no resistance.Thanks again
In a trenchcoat?
Merecido.Perjudicar a personas de tu pais para protestar por cosas de otro pais es bastante estupido.Hace tu reclamo en la embajada, no bloqueandole la calle a los autos de otro lado del mundo.
Why does this look so Ai‚Äôish?
There's a fucking Prime Problem there! WTF, is this Carbombya or something?!
Ah so not in Israel but world-wide, now THIS figure makes far more sense. I kind of figured it was unlikely in one place only.
in Israel? From bombings? Seems inflated. Nothing wrong with asking for a source, with such a claim. When you repeat something you read somewhere be prepared for someone to ask you this next time. Or don't, I don't care.
They can afford to drop thousands of tons of explosives onto civilians, yet can‚Äôt put a clear camera on their multi million dollar jets?
See the baby crib and stroller pisses me off.  Fuck Hamas
Optimus prime???
&gt;Update: ‚ÄúAerial vehicle confirmed to to be Hamas weather balloon‚Äù  Update: Blocked for trolling and disinformation.
It‚Äôs super gay to think he‚Äôs anything less than gorgeous.
And it‚Äôs totally not gay to think he‚Äôs hot.
The Israelis are more than capable of ending Hamas as an effective force in Gaza, if they actually go for it. There's been plenty of Terrorists organistations who were either wiped out or so effectively countered that they just gave up. In fact, thats what happens to most terrorist organisations. Any more excuses for the most disastarous US foreign policy regime since Carter?
Fun fact, the [Rolling Stone reporter character](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evan_Wright) is based on the actual experiences of Evan Wright, the author of the book *Generation Kill*.Also, the actor who plays Fruity Rudy was an actual Force Recon Marine who was actually in the push to Baghdad with 1st Marines.
yes they were standing in a row.  an unfortunate row.
Detonation vs. deflagration.You should learn the difference before you come here to lecture others.
It was attack from Yemen earlier today. Houthis, obviously.
optimus is palestinian after all
People really love dunking on naive extremist children and pretend like that‚Äôs what everyone believes on one side of the argument. Congrats, enjoy your upvotes, feel good, thousands of people are dead but we‚Äôre so much smarter then those crazy dumb internet people on instagram XD
That round killed 1500 Palestinian children.
I think it was a UAV from Yemen
Reality outjerked us again
Most likely a Houthi drone from Yemen heading north to Israel. A US warship shot down multiple Houthi drones in the Red Sea a few days ago.
&gt; Shopping Cent*re*How do you do, my fellow Yanks?
Absolutely love it. It is like a modern version of Band of Brothers/The Pacific with way more humor.

This looks like a scene from the 60s sci-fi movie.
Oh God... why?
No it‚Äôs for people who don‚Äôt use their critical thinking abilities and want a bit of dopamine by clicking a button that validifies their assumptions and beliefs. And does absolutely nothing of importance for creating a dialogue, and in fact drowns out important conversations by contributing to 1 of 2 resounding echo chambers, both of which are utilizing records levels of propaganda in desperate attempts to persuade as many people as possible at any cost, regardless of truth.

PS. I don't lie for upvotes or attention. I simply talk about what I have read or researched. It took me two minutes to find out that figure and convert it. You could have done the same before calling me a liar.
No.
Bomb explosions don't go straight up, there's something funneling those explosions.
that ricochet at :03... wonder where that landed...
*Generation Kill* is fantastic and IMO one of the best captures of the US military experience in terms of how we talk and act with each other. On one deployment we even had a company level officer also lose his shit a bit. VetTV does a pretty good job too.
Idk if it makes sense but i believe you can report this to malaysian authorities. While Malaysia does support Palestine, being out and about Hamas supporter might make it adjacent to islamic extremist groups which Malaysia cracks down on
Pentagono.
Which military area or facility would you prefer Hamas to fall back to in Gaza?
Israel had no real choice, and Hamas knows this.The current Israeli strategy of making friends with the 0.001% of the Arab population that is part of the Gulf state ruling class and hoping that good feeling will somehow trickle down to the Arab masses is hopeless.As long as the masses hate Israel, a group like Hamas that is full of hopeless young men willing to die for the cause can always politically defeat Israel by creating violence that breeds resentment in the Arab public. The Saudis won't officially normalize with Israel for years after this, at which point Hamas or whatever comes after will simply do this again and repeat the cycle.Israel needs more imaginative leadership.
OK, well, good luck! I'm sure all the death will stop all the death. It will all work out just fine.
Over the last 20 years, 1,699 journalists have been killed. That works out at 85 per year. So one dies every four days. I read a headline that gave that exact figure in quotes but I can't find it. I need to get used to providing a source if I make a claim. I often just repeat things I have read. I've just checked if my source works and it says there is malware present but several articles give the figure of 1,699 dying over the last 20 years. Google it and you'll come up with 1,699.&amp;#x200B;[sf.org/en/1668-journalists-killed-past-20-years-2003-2022-average-80-year](https://sf.org/en/1668-journalists-killed-past-20-years-2003-2022-average-80-year)
maldito! pero por favor no El Aviv!!!
Shocking you‚Äôre getting downvoted for staying a fact. They‚Äôre turning Gaza into another mauriopol
&gt;What's the point of a detailed event list of what occurred on Oct. 7th? Wouldn't you get more information researching the ongoing conflict between the two that lead up to this event? From what i understand, on Oct. 7th a large amount of Hamas infiltrated the Israeli boarder at once, dispersed and performed a lot of targeted murders all at once on a holy day where they were vulnerable. Once again, what's the point of a timeline?
I don't believe the majority want that, I do believe that some in positions of power have worked to engineer conflict (on both sides) for a long time. Collective punishment is wrong, no question.
The death of innocent civilians in Gaza *is* a war crime, and that crime is being committed by Hamas not Israel. The use of human shields is in itself categorized as a specific intent war crime under the Geneva Convention and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
Hamas stores their rockets along tunnel walls, deep underground. the rockets cant go through 20-50m of rock and dirt from deep underground. they don't look like the surface cook-offs you see in Ukraine or ammo dump explosions. These aren't military grade explosives, those explode in their own way, and are less powerful. Rather than flying around, the propellant and explosives ignite each-other in the tunnels creating a sort of eruption like effect like they blast out of exits. Hamas also produces their rockets in the tunnel, using various materials like sugar, fuels, and fertilizer.But in the middle, lower left at 9 seconds you can see a single escaped projectile heading down the street.The weird part is you don't see what set off the detonation in the first video, every explosion from start to finish is munitions detonating in the tunnels. I cant even tell if the other videos are related as they cut off way too early and are zoomed way in
First one shows that there are tunnels with stored munitions underneath the city streets.
Thank you for illustrating my point so succinctly
I don't understand how people think there are secondaries in the first clip. Its a coordinated JDAM attack, and the second set of explosions is another set of strikes. Do people really think that secondaries look the same as the JDAM strike lol.
The demonstrations around the world aren‚Äôt anti Jewish they are pro Palestinian. Over 2,000 children have been killed in 2 weeks by Israeli air strikes. Not justifiable
Every day is more ‚ÄúThis is Hamas FAFO moment‚Äù footage. Some of the FLIR footage is crispy!
You guys talking about how this is going to radicalize the Palestinians need to put down the crack pipe. They already went around raping and beheading toddlers without provocation, and the journalists went around justifying it and victim blaming the jews for existing. What can these assholes do to Israel that they weren't already doing?IMO the israelis are acting this way because they have decided the Palestinians are already implacably hostile to them. So I think now the unstated goal is \[censored by reddit\]. No one is going to be radicalized in gaza because they're going to turn it into a parking lot
Those caramel deLites are the bomb
Guys surelyyyy all this is a land dispute right? Right?
Alot of people crying foul after the sucker punch of the year ....
Where are the secondaries? use your head for a second. The first set of strikes are a coordinated JDAM attack, with a second set of attacks a few seconds later.
I hate commenting publicly on this kind of shit, but I do agree, this is what needs to start happening.
Bingo
Yeah, and they'll get fucked up in the process...
No. They are high on the hatred of Jews.
Disgusting, I had to wait until I was 16 to join the National guard youth program, to learn to shoot.
The death of Stalin stopped the purges.
Not fully accurate. It‚Äôs multiple bombs striking along the tunnels the explosions that come after are the munitions.
And the jihad initiated by the hamas is meant for peace and happiness in the region. In what unicorn and rainbow world do you live in?
This is bleak.
To my knowledge israel doesn't use the m249
Hamas realllllllly didn‚Äôt think this through lol
To be fair I don't think they are going to find the hostages in London.
Hamas doesn't control west bank but they are there ans fighting the idf. It isn't hard to find unbiased info. You just gotta look and educate yourself.
Maybe until it stops smoking at the very least.
&gt;What the hell was Hamas thinkingDesperate or manipulated people do not think rationally. Helpless charges, suicidal uprisings, and the killing of innocent people have happened all throughout history.
1. That they will embarrass Israel and win a lot of support from Qatar, China, Russia and Iran (plus billion of micro-transactions from bleeding hearts and muslims worldwide)  \- Check...2. That they will capture many hostages and clean out Israeli prisons  \- Check (halfway there but trust me on this one)...3. That they will rally the many miserable Gazans and enshrine Hamas as "the only power that can do something", inspiring Gazans to live in misery for a lot longer  \- Check...  Hamas HAVE been thinking.  We in Israel were circle-jerking.
This is all manipulation and propaganda. The posters.This video.These obvious bots in the comments. We are being conditioned my dudes
Probably going to shoot some kids playing football on the beach like before...
&gt;That part of the world is gonna be so much better without Hamas"Is it going to fix the issue? The death of Stalin and the USSR did not stop Putin. As long as there is hate, resentment, and inequality, another group like Hamas will emerge.  Honestly i have no hope that this region will see peace.
Just need some hero to start posting it all here lmao. They‚Äôve got to have some peak footage and heaps of it. Drones have been around basically forever now and I can‚Äôt imagine leadership passing that up just for learning opportunities if anything.
sorry dude, I can't agree at all.  1) Hamas makes money on BEING a terrorist organisation. The whole idea of countries that want to shake up stuff is to sponsor terrorism to destabilise established countries.  If Hamas wouldn't bother the middle east, than Russia, Qatar, Iran and China will find someone else who would  2) Hamas has proven that they are not simple minded. I mean, the footman eating 556, JDAMs and Hellfires - sure.  But their leadership is outplaying the Israeli leadership - or, at least, posing some dilemmas that Israel would struggle to solve
They beheaded Optimus prime and are now parading his head publicly.
Are you considering people living in the Negev desert as settlers?
How strong and organized they let this fk terrorist become.. they are bombing every day and still has some shit there.. but Hamas is probably done after the invasion. ISIS and now this fukers
Either a Negev or an m249
Always take these with a grain of salt of course but in Israel everyone knows someone that at least knows someone. So it's not that out of the question. I've heard similar things.
Optimus Palestine? Terrorformers? I don‚Äôt think Ill manage better than that
They haven't been vocal about it at all and post-war solutions have barely received any attention. It's very clear from the current situation that they are uncertain on how to proceed, even from a military perspective.
Thats because knowing Chatham, it probably is.
Hamas roll out
Thanks for this!  This is the best approximation of what I am looking for.  Unfortunately not the whole picture but it has me started
They weren't. They legitimately believed that their resistance was dealing actual real damage and Israel would just roll over, give up and die the same way the Americans were chased out of Vietnam and Afghanistan. What they don't realize is, Americans can go back to America. Israelis are fighting for their home and existence. Apart from the elderly, nobody in Gaza has enough brains to realize that Gaza was conquered by Israel in 1967 in under 6 days.Jews have been ethnically cleansed and genocided multiple times before Islam was even born. They reclaimed their capital an entire 2,000 years after the Romans destroyed it. If there's anybody in the history of the world who is more stubborn than Palestinians, it's the Jew.
The REAL Pentagon is in Italy and was built by a Pope:  https://robertobrumat.wordpress.com/2021/05/10/il-pentagono-italiano/  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vghZv9GAaCY
The civilian casualties are not justified, but the culpability lies with Hamas for using them as human shields. It seems you would prefer Israel not bomb military installations that use human shields, but I encourage you to follow through with that thought experiment. It sets a *nasty* precedent essentially telling all 2 bit wannabe despots and tyrants that the best answer to the threat of bombing is simply to use more human shields, because it‚Äôs the only way to stop the bombs from dropping.
 *I'm Neo in the third act of The Matrix.*
Every secret operation has had an eye in the sky just imagine all the footage if it was recorded that's hidden somewhere on a network across the world.
ok
Israel has plans for both military and post-war political solutions and have been quite vocal about it.
Thanks for your wonderful and coherent contribution to this discussion.
They knew Israel would respond like this, spark outrage in the Arab world, and derail political normalization between Israel and Arab countries. Israel took their bait and more.
Hamas leaders could be on the moon, and Mossad will still get them.
Someone cast inferno.
It‚Äôs Joever, they have Optimus Prime on their side
But i thought leveling gaza would not only wipe out terrorism but also stop people from joining them.  /s
Hamas are not Shia. They're sponsored by Iran, but they're not Shia.Hamas didn't get along with ISIS, but they've clearly adopted some of their tactics.
Zitter: firmly crumbling in the Zussy of Musk.
Serious question: did Hamas load these guys up with some type of (meth)amphetamine before sending them across the border?
The raid is by Shayetet 13, basically the Israeli equivalent of the navy SEALs.
Okay!  so I watched most of it (at least half) before it went into even more opinion.  Here's my issue.  This isnt what I was asking for.  Ben Shapiro is a staunch zionist.  Obviously and rightfilly upset by the appearent events, he begins with a monologue and immediately sets out to dehumanize Palestinians in Gaza.  Being an adult, we should understand the situation is more complex, and theres no such thing as Jew=Benevolent, Arab=irrationally genocidal, and VICE VERSA.  I am old enough to hear about how my people are savages for over 2 decades, while Arabs and Mulsims have taken the brunt force of violence from the west and its allies.  Now onto what I asked for vs what this was.  I am looking for a detailed description of the events.  Ben did not offer this.  He offered horrifying images taken by who knows and only credited Yoseph Haddad, who is a zionist activist and former IDF soldier.  The other description of events came from a IDF Major General Veruv.  another video was of another IDF commander speaking.  The only source level info with credit was the MSNBC interview with a mother of children taken.  That was the only actual news offered by Ben.  The rest was propoganda, albeit horrifying.  Would just like to get some clarification of events before the IDF stepped all over everythingI appreciate the time.
Your a goon. Wanting mass genocide of not 1 but 2 religions. That‚Äôs over 2 billion people. I‚Äôm not religious but if people want faith let them. Not all religious people are nut jobs most just want to get on with their lives.
~~Inshallah~~ God willing
Well of course. I will give you some help with that. I won't tell you because you should do something also. Let's see, we have Israelis and Palestinians. We can say that they are part of a different ethnic and or religious group right? Now let's see the other thing. ... Intentional destruction of a people in whole or in part. Being deprived of any rights, killing thousands of them, expelling Palestinians from their houses and now depriving them the essential things like water and food could be said that those are a good definition of intentional destruction of a people. Now if you listen to the things the leaders of Israel are saying about Palestinians you could add that up as evidence to intentionally destroy another group.
They're likely trying to figure out what to do because they are unsure where the enemy is.I assume they are covering those civilian cars, otherwise why stop in the middle of the road? They call out "Let's go, let's go!" at the end, maybe to get the civilians to move to cover.
Maybe soon we will see the American flag there too.
Wow, Hamas invented their own roofknocker rocket, to try and save civilian lives. /s
Yeah this is incredibly morbid but thermal equipped drones hovering above soldiers operating??If this invasion goes down the footage is going to be crazy. FWIW this is not a reason to want it to happen but it would be interesting to see how these urban operations play out from that kind of angle and in that level of detail.
Should probably mention these are secondary explosions coming from a busted tunnel, and not 30 JDAMS
&gt;this shit may continue until doomsdayWe have been watching these groups kill each other every 10 years for the last century and you somehow think this is going to be hashed out anytime soon?Both of these groups walked away from the negotiating table generations ago. This situation just puts a few more miles between both groups and they negotiating table. The chance we are ever going to be able to walk either side back is ridiculous.Even if 95% of Palestinians capitulate there's always going to be that 5% extremist core that will never leave Israel alone. And even if 95% of Israelis choose to work with Palestinians there will always be that Zionist 5% core that don't want to.Going to be right back here in 10 or 15 years watching these groups kill each other again. Just like the last time. And the last time. And the dozens of last times before
36th div belongs to northen command but will participate in all offensive operations as its one of the 2 non reserve armored divisions of the idf(and the better one at that :) )if a northern front will open it will surely be the first to redeploy
Supply and demand, bro. I don‚Äôt see a lot of parkas for sale in Hawaii. But I bet they have a surplus of swim suits
So you can‚Äôt tell me?
they thought Israel is cowardly and weak and the moment they'll get hostages, Israel would be cowering before them. Even if thousands of Palestinians die, it's a sacrifice Hamas are willing to make. Moreover, I think even they were surprised by how successful their 7/10 operation was, they didn't expect to be able to take so many prisoners, but more than that, they didn't expect to kill so many. I think they expected their forces to encounter heavy resistance in protection of roads and villages, so they'd be able to strike the outposts, but nothing like this happened, so they just massacred their way through the Israelis countryside. Now Israel can't stop, it can't allow itself to continue to live with Hamas at the helm in Gaza.
It's just pro-Israel propaganda, it's not like they'll somehow appear in London.
Hamas is targeting kids. Israel is targeting Hamas.Israel protects it's citizens with it's rockets. Hamas puts Palestinian children in front of their rockets.Two-sideism is pathetic.
You don't need to be a historian to see how military action does not solve the root of the conflict. But hey, time will prove me right. Get ready to be dissapointed.
Impressive
As Hezbollah's leader said when addressing the Israelis in a speech some years ago: "You love life and we love death".
Looks like a tunnel was hit in the first video.
No it really cannot. Just read one more time and try to understand what it says. Come on now. You can do it.
Oh man, I didn't even realise that!!I thought this was some sort of coordinated bombs exploding at the same time. That is insane!
If I have to tell you that than you are not paying attention my boy.
True, but Hamas has another card to play. Release all the hostages with US passports but hold on to the Israelis. If that happens, how long will the US attention span/support last?  Factor in upcoming elections also where Biden could be edged out of the Whitehouse.
By this very broad definition, the defeat of Nazi Germany and the eradication of Nazis and the subsequent banning of that party in Germany, would be considered Genocide. I‚Äôm sure you don‚Äôt think that was bad to do.
I tell you, it didn't
It's almost as though some rockets are defective and don't work, and others are not defective and do work. Crazy concept, huh?
The last thing Israel wants is other governments in Gaza watching their apartheid policies first hand. They will never allow other countries to run Gaza.
Impressive!
Because if the situation doesn't improve for the average Gazan after this war, the place will continue to be a breeding ground for this type of extremism.Israel only has plans for military action. Improving life conditions requires political actions, continuous dialogue, investments, etc. The current Israeli government will never consider that, even though this is exactly what is necessary to achieve a more peacefull situation in the long run. But to be fair, you can just see how this thing will go and judge for yourself after a few years. I'm 100% sure i will be right. And i don't even want to be right, but that's the way it's going to be.Since this is /r/combatfootage, a subreddit focussed on military action, you'll have the typical bias of people thinking that miltary action resolves everything. It doesn't.
What‚Äôs your hometown, fellow man-of-Kent?
And how is that what israel is doing? By dropping bombs on legally legitimate military targets after thousands of warnings and evacuation orders? Also interesting how despite the ‚Äúyears of genocide‚Äù the Palestinian is 6 times larger than it was in 1967 and continues to grow each year. Perhaps you should focus on dismantling the terror regime who is absolutely throttling Palestinian civilians, stealing all their aid and money, brainwashing the kids to become terrorists, taking their fuel, using their water pipes to build rockets, and using their violence and murder to oppress Palestinians and use them then discard them in their quest for Jewish blood. You‚Äôd rather ignore all that though right?Without Hamas oppressing them, the Palestinians might actually have a chance for a happy and safe life. Sad it had to come to an awful war for that to happen.
For a few seconds my dumb ass thought that it was the US flag
Hamas lied about the death toll and US/European intel believes the death toll was only 10-50. Hope this helps!
I'm not American! Nor have I expressed any support to either side. Isreal is killing kids, Hamas is killing kids.Dismantle away!
They blew up part of the hospital parking lot, not the hospital itself. No (((zionist))) propaganda here. There‚Äôs plenty of photos and videos of what happened along with plenty of confirmation from non-biased sources that day it was a Palestinian rocket. Learn what‚Äôs going on before running your mouth.
Yeah that's a pretty normal reaction, I totally agree
agreed. :(
Oh noooo won‚Äôt someone think of the settlers
It wasn't and it will never think.Imagine the amount of money Hamas could make by just having a civil conversation with Israel and start a peaceful trade between areas.Terrorist organizations are simple minded and filled with religious problems. They kill who talks bad about a book (fantasy) but it is ok to go to a concert and kill teenagers.
Reading the daily mail online isn‚Äôt good for your mental health.
Why are so many Americans always thinking everything going on in the world is similar to them?I see it so much. Thinking Israel vs Hamas is White vs Black (While over 70% of Israelis have brown skin themselves). Thinking it's all about race (While over 20% of Israelis are Arabs) and thinking Israel vs Gaza is going to play out like the US attacking foreign far away nations which have nothing to do with it.Israel has no long term interest in controlling Gaza. In fact our country left there and gave the Palestinians the keys almost 20 years ago.Hamas will be dismantled or at least lose 99% of it's strength in Gaza. The PA will return (Which much of the population already accepts and has all the institutions and forces ready right this second) and the entire world has already shown they would help Gazans with aid to rebuild.
There will be no Gaza.
I do not have a side in this, I guess I was always educated in the ways of thinking Palestinians PLO was the bad guy back then. But a lot has changed in the decades past. A terrorist group attacking a population does not in my own opinion warrant attacking the ethnic population of said terrorist group. I do agree that millitary targets are fair game but not starving a population.
he who smelled it...
More people need to comment to stop this inflow of propaganda and misinformation. They need to get used to it.
The Jewish community majority wants the Palestinians wiped off the earth. It does not matter if they are all Hamas or only some Hamas, they want all the Palestinian/Arabs gone. Hamas just gave them the opportunity they needed to kill as many as possible claiming it warranted because of the attack made by hamas.
Genocide is the intentional destruction of a people in whole or in part. In 1948, the United Nations Genocide Convention defined genocide as any of five "acts committed with intent to destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group".
If you actually read the comment you replied to, they're clearly talking about Palestinian civilians caught in the crossfire.
They were warned days in advance of the Hamas attack. Netanyahu just sacrificed his own in order to get a casus belli for his war. I don't think he considered that Hamas would be this "successful" though.
You did imply...
What the hell was Hamas thinking
That "oh my God " means business  ü§£ü§£ü§£
Or the blue flash is an indicator two power lines hit each other and arced?
How is it genocide?
Damn we don‚Äôt get to see actual naval combat that often
Not surprised they‚Äôve resorted to this when they‚Äôve been treated the way they have for such a long time.
There was a lot of ID confusion, IDF and police had a hard time discerning which fire was friendly/enemy
Can I get some more of that beside the turret long-range cannon salvos
Idk maybe , but will never know if that's the best explanation of what you think will happen over there .. Seems to me your comment is dumb , no?
Where in Afghanistan have I heard that before
I meant if that skiff/little boat had travelled a liittle further and the shots had deflected, the filmer couldve potentially had a very bad day.
Negotiations,wars  , occupation and  isolation it's all been done .. Israel's best option is to send the gaza strip to the store age ..Peeps be thinking Isreal is going to black opps every Hamas member .A massive portion of Gaza was active or supportive of hamas,  imagine what the number will be like now ... No way Israels is planning on a large occupation or leaving enough Infustrucure intact on the strip to support a large population...
It's a good stepping stone towards a career in anti fraud.
Probably dont get paid enough to stop barking dogs at the border.
That part of the world is gonna be so much better without Hamas
My uncle lives next to an apartment that was hit yesterday. Our relatives are all texting on WhatsApp panicking bc you could feel that rockets had gotten through and exploded, the buildings shookHe‚Äôs not answering, we‚Äôre worried. We see on the news it‚Äôs in his neighborhood. We panic moreHe calls back all ‚Äòakol beseder, achi‚Äô and sharing fucking videos he took of the smoking scrapnel outside, like there couldn‚Äôt have been another fucking barrage of rockets ü´†
UK is a shithole lmao
Harder to meat ride terrorist when there's footage of their war crimes
Ah yes. The number of my comments is the issue.Maybe I was lurking and had enough of Hamas supporters crawling around this website so decided to participate?I know it hurts to see anything but [Iranian propaganda](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9bvkqa/an_update_on_the_fireeye_report_and_reddit/) here. Well get used to it.
So hard to understand what Hamas is trying to achieve, like they are happy to lose 100 soldiers to kill 1 Israeli. Technologically/mentally they are still in the stone age.
the guy in the vehicle ask the camera man if he see a terrorist and camera man said yes ,then u have some time jump and they saying it is our forces there and then they boarding the vehicle.  probably others IDF forcers already engaged with this terrorists and there was not point in staying while u have so many other pockets of terrorists killing unarmed civilians
"has there ever been a successful operation of wiping out a terrorist organization completely because I can‚Äôt recall so.  LTTE (Tamil Tigers) have been awfully calm lately....
They gotta be on drugs to go out onto that water with military ships floating about.
el explosi√≥n
I am the English language and I can confirm, he is better than me.
Sounded like a negev
This really shows what a massive advantage thermal cameras are. The picture from the drone is clear as day.
You really need to understand the extremist Islamic concept of death. Ever saw the video of the ISIS people drawing lots or something for who gets the honor of driving an explosives-laden truck into a target? These guys are truly radical in their beliefs, and they glorify death in a way that is shocking and unimaginable to our western sensibilities. They knew their actions would cause a lot of death, but they celebrate them. Unfortunately many people in Gaza that DON‚ÄôT share in their beliefs are caught in this too.
That was some highrate of fire weapon there at the end. Any idea what it was?
It's pretty telling how you could know which side you are seeing, if you were not told. If they are already surrounded by rubble they are in Gaza. If it's a nice furnished condo it's always Israel.
There are literally videos and recording of Hamas blocking roads so Palestinians wouldn‚Äôt be able to get away from the fighting. As for civilian infrastructure, do you know what the hundreds of thousands Hamas fires at Israel are made from? That‚Äôs right, water pipes meant to serve the Palestinians.No one is saying the IDF are saints but if you really care about the Palestinians civilians you should know they have no bright future while Hamas is in power.
I‚Äôm not surprised this comment comes from a west ham fan
Dude thinks helmets are gonna stop rocket attacks  from taking limbs off and buildings falling down. Op needs a helmet.
Seeing the same headline for 2 weeks now. Ground  invasion has way too many downsides for Isreal . It will trigger war with Hesbullah. I think it's not gonna happen.
Israrli Navy seems to not intentionally hit the boat. It is giving them a warning shots thats intentional misses and that says get the f out of that boat and sea.
Hell that‚Äôs nothing. Come to the West, where the porn is free, saturated, and just a few simple clicks away on your phone. we also have god awful musical (I hate to even call them musicians) influences such as ‚ÄúSexy Redd‚Äù and ‚ÄúDoja Cat‚Äù , not to mention abortion clinics busier than a Sunday night football game. let‚Äôs not forget the massive birth rate decline, fentanyl literally on every street corner, overcrowded prisons for profit to go with corrupt police officers/government officials, marital rates declining at an all time low, i could go on and on but I have to get to work so I can provide for my family so we can afford our over priced and undersized apartment to go along with our hellacious grocery bill! Talk about indecency
&gt;Israel can't winIt's not about winning, it's about getting back the deterrence perception that the IDF had before 7 Oct, creating a DMZ, and hopefully, maybe, even get the hostages (or their bodies) back.
Vague negativistic comments from people - never historians of course - wanting to believe that insurgencies/terrorists have never been defeated
Ah yeah, the "human shield" narration. Hamas is using really similar absurd rhetoric. Obviously you won't change your mind even if I point you to UN reports stating that IDF constantly, deliberately targeted civilian infrastructure. There are so many cases of it but sure, IDF is the Mary Poppins of the Middle East. I see that your love for child murderers stands strong.
Is that Pentagon City? Or some copycat brit thing? LmaoEdit: yeah its some british thing. I thought that was the big ass mall thats at Pentagon City in DC
&gt;I think they're the dog that caught the car. I agree, they caught Israel at the exact time when they looked away. The people storming the border were surprised they didn't get stopped by the IDF.
NC?
Hamas leadership is safe and protected in Qatar also. No amount of bombing Gaza will reach them. And unfortunately, with the amount of casualties Palestinians are taking, Hamas is going to have plenty of recruits after this is over.
Then where is the representation of both, this is one sided political propaganda to push a pro Israel narrative.  If they wanted to condemn both sides they could have done that, instead they chose to only represent Israel‚Äôs struggle.
You don't know how much they hate jews, it bring them together.
Cut down on Starbucks. Make your own coffee.  You could save like $35 a week. That should fix it.
Close to 90% in the US support Israel, including large majorities of both political partiesMaybe more importantly, our attention spans are short. The news cycle has already mostly moved on, leaving Israel with carte blanche to do what it likes at this point. I don't see any serious "outrage" from anyone other than bored online slacktivists and bots, other than in the  expected places, which have very little impact on anything
Yep exactly. We're all on the same team here, relax.
I don't doubt that at all, they're all Sunni terrorists
When you have nothing left to defend IDF Genocide of Palestinians you go after the Holy Quran...the thing you forgot was that IDF killer Christians too when they bombed the 1400 year old Church in Gaza... I guess the Holy Bible has the same terrorism message like the Quran according to you.
I hope the hostages are ok
Tamil Tigers seemed like an "idea" that couldn't be stopped at one point
Holy hell, town-next-to-hometown mentioned on NC? Huh
Only when Hamas are invading there. After that Israel are the justice deliverers.
See every single insurgency style war ever.
That bastards destroying citizen buildings. How this is not war crime?
Yeah like rape, decapitate, and shoot rockets....crazy stuff
Yes, her.
He knows more than the troops on the ground
Not indiscriminate at all
But that‚Äôs not fair! College students told me that the goal in war is a 1:1 casualty rate. Lopsided = genocide
I always laugh and cry to read about Queers for Palestine
Disgusting human beings.
The only support Israel needs from the Americans is the only thing that holds Israel from starting to target civilians in Gaza. The goal is to overthrow Hamas by the civilians. The siege can last for months but Hamas isn‚Äôt prepared for it. 2 million people will get hungry fast and will eventually take over the tyrannical extremists that is Hamas. Last paragraph is only my 1 cent opinion.
Can't be a terrorist if you're killing the terrorists you silly goose.
Yeah well, I can say the same about the IDF, literally.A bunch of rapists and murderers carrying out terrorist attacks against the Palestinians for 50+ years, but they‚Äôre getting global support for some reason. But guess what? The majority of people are waking up to this and are finally supporting Palestine, because Israeli propaganda doesn‚Äôt seem to work like it did in the 60s-80s, when you can commit genocide and hide it.Egypt, Turkey and Iran have way bigger and stronger militaries, stop your delusion please, you're so arrogant and ignorant. Ranting everyday about ‚Äúanti Semeticism‚Äù, about terrorism and about the holocaust. Yet, you are doing exactly this to everyone around you, literally nobody likes you in the region except some leaders, so I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre the issue here.You got destroyed by 800 Hezbollah fighters in 2006, so please don‚Äôt mention the ‚Äústrongest military in the area‚Äù thing again when your record on land is a laughing stocküòÇ
That was a clean throw though
A lot of tactics used were isis tactics. They also had instructions from AQ on how to make chemical weapons.
They have been kissing ass to isis ever since they were at their height during the Civil wars.
Ottomans had always welcomed Jews, from Spain and Nazi Germany.
Rudy? Is that you?
Israel is a terrorist state
Listen here buddy I went to FU (Facebook University) and I have a master's degree from my evangelical church and I am the expert on all things I feel like talking about on the internet and don't make me make empty threats and use all caps next time I type something
No one is shooting back because they are all in their tunnels hiding from the night bombing. if no one shoots back at you it means you're doing a good job defending your soldiers. the objective was to destroy infrastructure and I assume it was a success.
I hope whatever your government does something and you get the same situation in like Israelis and Palastanians on the both side. There are so many people who doesn't want war and justification like this is crazy. You justify genocide by saying yeah you should have not chosen x government. This is called mass punishment. I did not choose, I born here what can a person do? Like what could have you done if you were in the same place? I'm not Palastian nor Isreali but I also have been living with a government that I did not choose for a long time. Nowadays Nazis are USA, Israel and Russia can't you see it? They all like to murder and invade and USA just does not care other than money. You like a foot soldier are here to die, and others can make money. No one benefits from wars other than military industrial complex. This ww2 comparison bullshit is crazy. I guess you would have called North Vietnamese people terrorists who needed to be destroyed and refer back to the Nazis.
And, they all hide in the same place under the same tunnel systems. What makes a difference what‚Äôs the name of the group that committed genocide on civilians, jews, Muslims and Christians alike. they are sharing the same ideologies and needs to be eradicated accordingly.
Explain why not then.
Do you genuinely think that if the IDF entered Gaza today that Hamas would be wiped out? I can‚Äôt understand why people think that‚Äôs even remotely possible. Hamas is a multi country organization that‚Äôs being backed by and from different countries and different people. In short, an invasion into Gaza alone will do nothing. None the less, let‚Äôs say Hamas was strictly contained to Gaza, has there ever been a successful operation of wiping out a terrorist organization completely because I can‚Äôt recall so.
Well thank you, now imagine a whole city and network of tunnels full of these fighters, you think an army like Israel's can take them out without losing half their forces?
Great idea. Dead baby chucks won‚Äôt get in my hair.
Nah‚Ä¶by everyone lol
What? 1.5k Hamas fighters went through to Israeli settlements, only like 150 were left behind not ‚Äúaround a thousand‚Äù. And those 150 literally announced their buildings to the IDF, because they also had hostages inside, so the IDF just sieged the buildings, and guess what? They still lost a brigade commander and a bunch of other soldiers during these sieges, and they also invaded 2 others cities even when the IDF was deployed heavily in the South. Please research the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, it was 800 Hezbollah fighters with AKs and Katyushas against 30k fully equipped IDF soldiers with air and sea support, Israel still got its butt kicked hard.So don‚Äôt just throw numbers around without having an idea of what you‚Äôre talking about. Otherwise, why are they delaying the invasion everyday for the past 2 weeks? Literally everyday.Another fun fact about Israel's ground forces, in 1968 Al Karameh battle, and after Israel's repulsion from Jordan, Jordanian soldiers found Israelis tied up to their tanks so they wouldn‚Äôt run away from the fighting.
So they aren‚Äôt barbaric terrorist of one clan, they are barbaric terrorists of another one. Got it üëç
El-Aviv? Mexico?
Hamas is (akin to) ISISThere. Now we can all be happy. I‚Äôm a uniter.
Nah, probably Girl Scout cookies.
Hamas threw a rock at a hornets nest.....naked.  ...
The first one looks like a fire show at Rammstein concert .
You dumb?
Nukhba's naval unit infrastructure close to the beach. It's probably following the attempt to infiltrate from the sea couple of days ago.It's destroy&amp;gather intel mission likely.
The black smoke theat comes up though the rocket vents is from "rocket candy", improvised sugar based rocket fuel. Military explosives dont make much smoke, just kicking up a lot of dust and powdered concrete, which is grayish-white. You are talking out of your ass here.
They got rid of some bases being used by Hamas‚Äô naval forces and frogmen. And I‚Äôd trust they know what their doing far more than I‚Äôd trust you know what you‚Äôre talking about, random Redditor, especially since you clearly don‚Äôt
tunnel entrances, rocket and ATGM launch sites, outposts etc.
halloween decorations
I can't follow your logic. If they had a Manchester United flag with them would you instantly believe Manchester United had invaded Israel? Just because they had an ISIS flag doesn't mean they are ISIS...We know Islamic Jihad had a part to play. More than likely one of them cunts had it.
Their defense is hiding behind women and children so that the ignorants and hypocrites of the world would condemn Israel endlessly.This is why they are trying to prevent civilians from escaping war zones.
Oh don't worry, the IDF will justify it's spending by completely eliminating Hamas.
What is terror infrastructure?
We are regretting not taking care of this problem sooner.
Obviously, after Hamas, the terrorist organization invaded Israel.
There's almost no chance there will be Ukraine-like videos coming from Israeli side. It's always censored to bits and snippets, especially when it comes to Specops. There was a night raid on Hamas infrastructure at Southern Gaza beach, and that's all that can be clear from this video. No-one has to "justify the spending", whatever this means.
Those two things are definitely not comparable lol. Have you see the Hamas summer camp videos? They make no attempt to hide they are training the kids to be terrorists and commit murder against Jews.
It's also well known that it triangulates where rockets will land and prioritizes targets based on risk. With many more rockets than normal, they are probably just focusing on the ones with more dense residential areas and important targets in their trajectory.
Hamas can't be tackled by military action alone. I don't understand why people seem to believe this.
Hamas spend all the money with random rocket, they don't have any costal defense
lol what m8
they are mostly destroying terror infrastructure
The civilian deaths are completely unjustified. Hamas had no right to use them as human shields.
maybe one, the rest are probably War Crimes.
That‚Äôs the dedication I‚Äôm looking for. Your intel could prove crucial. Stay safe my recon warrior.
The IDF will just ‚Äúmow the grass‚Äù again in 15 years.
They are blowing tunnels - they are fuse delayed munitions
Second footage of Shayetet 13 this war, hope for more.Edit: first video this war - https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/comments/176dafj/israeli\_naval\_special\_forces\_shayetet\_13\_clearing/
Big role play vibes. No one shooting back, clearing the mess standing straight up, going through the motions. Gotta justify the spending I guess.
I know that is why I take English b SL
It was like Egypt and Iraq before they were colonized but always called by there name
Yup. Ga'ash division.
[Source](https://spankbang.com/6mkkp/video/kim+soo+ji+i+compilation+2) clip is at 35:22 I believe
Ok I‚Äôll book a flight now. I‚Äôll hit you back once I gain the recon you asked for
That's what the IDF published.
They‚Äôre in the US also
Tier 1 baby! get some
The death of innocent civilians in Gaza *is* a war crime, and that crime is being committed by Hamas not Israel. The use of human shields is in itself categorized as a specific intent war crime under the Geneva Convention and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
They‚Äôre expecting to generate more sympathy so people will look the other way while they bomb Palestinian civilians
So there was at least one ISIS flag but you are saying that they weren't involved? I can't quite follow that logic.
Having a trillion dollar military infrastructure, it would be a shame if even 1 Israeli soldier died from lack of use of  aforementioned trillion dollar military infrastructure.
Who drops the bombs on Gaza? The IDF. You can‚Äôt seriously tell me that those civilian casualties are justified. Saying Hamas uses human shields is just justification for killing civilians.
Sad, seconderies - definitely hospital equipment.
Glad to see the IDF kick ass there
Not really. It's Israeli territory so the only threat is hamasBut still getting close to a warzone is pretty stupid
Disgusting action and people
The death of innocent civilians in Gaza *is* a war crime, and that crime is being committed by Hamas not Israel. The use of human shields is in itself categorized as a specific intent war crime under the Geneva Convention and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
Obviously the fuckers support ISIS which is why they had a flag. But I don't think anybody can claim ISIS had a part in it at this point
I invented the English language and I can confirm: his English is better than mine.
Ah yes.....one of my worst nightmares
Considering the absolute clusterfuck of being taken completely by surprise, I'd say almost none who are actually loyal.
I'm guessing not enough otherwise they would know in advance about the 7th oct
What makes you think the IDF enjoys them, they are not the targets but Hamas uses them as human shields so they can live another day to actually target babies. You don‚Äôt have to like reality but ignoring it does not change things.
&gt;frustrating to hear my fellow Americans speak about gas prices, Nato, and any other international issue I think **one** of the reasons is because our country is so big, and so diverse that many people don't travel and have experiences beyond our borders.
If you only care about Israelis and see Palestinians only as collateral damage then yeah, this isn‚Äôt a conversation worth having.
Loser ü§£
It was a mass suicide bombing as far as they are concerned. Their goal is to cause pain and suffering, and they expect to die.
Strongly agreed
Far too gone, like my kids captured friends (x2) and their dead teacher? I guess so..
Ok.. Hamas and ISIS invaded Israel and butchered children while they were trying to hide and then burnt their bodies.Happy now?
Hamas has been sending huge barrages at Tel-Aviv and that area (like the airport and stuff too) for a couple days. Just in the last half an hour they sent a bunch of
Well I don't support anyone. I just don't like child murderers you know. Whatever is their religion. A quirk of mine you can say.
If Israel listens to all the whack-jobs in the West and does anything less than turning Gaza into a 300ft ditch devoid of all terrorists then there might be a coup. We‚Äôre kinda done with our government caring more about public opinion than our own people
I thought this was a repost at first. I already saw the exact same thing posted about in NYC. It seems they are putting this posters everywhere.
at the same time they are officially open to negotiate a deal to release civilians with Hamas (they said no deal except full return of hostages and full surrender).and the fact that the US sent all their reserve of 300 interceptors does show that their stockpile isn't that great, even if it was 30000 (100x what they sold to the US).
Yeah, like are they expecting them to turn up in London?
I noticed, but didn‚Äôt think much of it until I noticed it sparked someone‚Äôs curiosity. Now my curiosity has been sparked.
Only Israel does roof knocking, Hamas‚Äô goal is to kill civilians which is exactly the opposite of roof knocking
I mean, they literally state that they love death more than Jews love life.
Not quite. Many explosives have a primary charge (such as the fuse) that detonates the secondary more stable charge. Since the majority of hamas rockets are sourced locally their explosive composition is probably incredibly unstable. Friction, impact, or direct flame could cause the explosive to detonate instantaneously. Or on the other hand the explosives could be very low quality and fail to detonate which is also likely. Either way I wouldnt want to risk being completely vaporized
By everyone you mean you.
Is it so hard to believe that they are smart enough and evil enough that this is exactly what they wanted? Seeing all the Palestinian kids being bombed on TV for sympathy because they knew it would happen, and be willing to die fighting when Israel invades because they are fanatics.It's machiavellian, as is a lot of politics. It's a brutal means to an end, and their ends is getting Palestinian support.
*Pentagon says*: **SHOP!**
Antisemitism is flaring in Europe, but mostly because of the millions of Muslim immigrants that have flooded their countries. There will be a boomerang effect in which the far right parties will keep growing and winning. Italy. Sweden, France, Germany, etc are witnessing the destruction of their cultures and civil society. It's a massive issue and there will be mass expulsions in the next few years . If they can't win politically, there will be massive violence, the right is now just going to give up, and right not they are having huge increases in voter support. Sentiment for Muslim and Arab immigrants is at an all time low across EU.
You‚Äôre too far gone to even argue with
I understand what you are trying to say. But I also know what you did say, and what everyone is/will perceive it as.
I have heard a bunch of booms every night for the past couple of weeks and have had to head for shelter multiple times; you are right on the money
*The Pentagon shopping centre: this is your new reality, fuck you*
It may be true that a flag was found but ISIS and Hamas have been opponents for years and have separate ideologies. You can say Hamas is a terrorist organization without saying they are ISIS. It just isn‚Äôt true and does nothing to change the situation.
Good. Why would you want to waste munitions?
Edit: It was 3 French men
Even after I have offered you clarity , you still seem to believe i was saying something I was not.You are trying to inject your opinion into my sentence, please don't. I am not Palestinian and this war is not over.
Nothing about war is good
that makes the slogan above the door read like a threat.
Awww... I feel so sorry for them.. but then again not. Here is an easy way to stop the bombing...1. Return the captives2. Accept Israel right to exist in as 2 states side by side (yes, we know that the Palestinians have rejected multiple peace plans until now and it's actually against the Hamas charter to accept Israels right to exist).Seems pretty self inflicted to me. But seriously : Start war on a country by invading and butchering their babies... what did they expect?See how
That‚Äôs not the real Pentagon, I can tell by the fact that there‚Äôs no self-important yanks wandering around in suits‚Ä¶ just dreary UK weather, and the smell of piss &amp; cigarette butts. Amazing how I can actually *smell* this image.
Likely a first responder filming and assessing the situation
One side is using babies as a shield while the other doesn‚Äôt and you choose to support the side that does.
Nobody said a single rocket can blow up an entire hospital; but they can and quite a bit of damage where they hit. How about you get your head out of your ass and accept that terrorist launching rockets purposely aimed at civilians is a bad thing and should be condemned?
Good!  Not one building left standing!   Take over the land and make death an inconvenience to the enemy.
They should be deported.
Based on the original comment you responded to, You implied that the Hamas conducted their large scale terrorist attack so they "would be talked about on the global level." This would imply that they have achieved what they sought after "to be talked about". This would be considered "worth it", since they achieved their goal.So yes, you did imply that it was worth it for them.
So why did they leave ISIS flags? Or are you saying Israel was invaded by BOTH Hamas and ISIS?Mutilation of the bodies and other acts seem to align with ISIS previous activities.https://m.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-767887
I‚Äôm glad you got your information from the IDF üòÇüòÇüòÇ. That‚Äôs like me asking for non biased reporting on 9/11 from the United States defense department. You aren‚Äôt getting one.
Good shot! Wow!
Nice try Fedrial, the Pizza Meter will stay relevant for as long as there is a Pizza Hut in the Pentagon
Biden is already trying to prevent Israel from going in on the ground, apparently his foreign policy successes in Afghanistan and Ukraine have taught him to trust his inner Jimmy Carter.
As I didn‚Äôt go school and I just schooled you have you anything on the contrary to what I‚Äôve said or are you the one that hasn‚Äôt been to school ü§£ü§£ü§£
I hope that Hamas is still celebrating this festival of lights six months from now. If it takes six months of bombs to kill every single one of those devil pigs, then good for it
The explosions smoke colour is also saying no major Hamas weapons storage facilities were hit as a lot of their explosives are ANFO based and you would see the signature orange tinge smoke.If there was a big secondary explosion then it would be ejected at the weakest point from the source and along the tunnels and would reduce with intensity from the epicenter. Not evenly spaced like we see here and producing the same exact explosion along a road.I think Hamas should get destroyed for what it did in Israel but trying to claim this is some sort of major Hamas weapons storage site isn't correct.
Hard to protest when you have no food water or shelter and you are constantly fearing air strikes from the IDF. If anything this will radicalize more people in support of Hamas and that‚Äôs what Israel wants in the long run to justify further persecution of Palestinians
How long before Hamas makes or gets an Iranian knock off of those suicide drone boats Ukraine is using against Russian Navy?
Hamas isn‚Äôt ISISEdit: did I say Hamas isn‚Äôt a terrorist group? No. But the two groups are factually not the same and have been opponents for years. Someone please provide proof that Hamas and ISIS are now the same organization. Would be greatly appreciated
Alt F4, Alt F4!!
Well you‚Äôve also justified this attack on Israel with that statement.
They also store ammo lengthwise along tunnels, we've already seen pictures of that.watching twice at .5 speed i counted at least 16 explosions mostly of the same size, if those were all JDAM that would mean they had to coordinate 8 F-16 for a single strike. kinda overkill even for the IDF.
Nah, they knew that antisemitism is so strong throughout the world that they could get away with even the most utterly despicable provocation imaginable and still be able to play victim, and that‚Äôs exactly what is happening.Hamas are a lot of things but they‚Äôre not stupid. You may not be able to figure out what their plan is but be sure that they do have a plan and it‚Äôs working.
You aren't fit to advise my dingleberries.
israel was finding a reason to annihilate gaza,hamas gave them one
Did i say or imply it was worth it ? I only highlighted that the world is now talking about something that it wasn't before. Whether or not the Palestinians believe that's worth the cost I don't know, ask them.
I strongly advise a long look in the mirror.
So why didya say wat you said to start with?Pompous ü§°
3 weeks ago were they facing a full scale invasion/offensive which is going to destroy 70% of the infrastructure and completely upend and change the lives of every single citizen forever? Hard to say with a serious face that all that is "worth it" for 2 million people, to just simply be talked about.
I just looked it up, they said it was to take out a stockpile of weapons and specific individuals.
I don't think Israeli state is regretting anything.
A bird told you the details?
Yeah sure thing fed
I wonder how many 'moles' Israel has active in Gaza...probable and hopefully lots of inside (literally) intel
Support for Israel in the US has rocketed after Oct 7. Americans know a 9/11 when they see one. The Queers for Palestine are not representative of public sentiment.
13-1700, according to Hamas.
Thanks
I would change the title in: "Nightly \*precision strikes\* compilation of Israeli air force in Gaza for the 26/27 of October."
I don't live in gaza and I'm not Palestinian so it wouldn't be prudent for me to speak on behalf of their feelings.
This is a very controversial war, and many people love to hate a side for no particular reason.So, I guess many comments were deleted to avoid more controversy or because it broke the rules of the sub.
.... what are you smoking?2-10 terrorists fortified themselves somewhere in a civilian area at an unknown position with possible hostages, them having claymores and satchel charges plus anti tank weapons.That takes ages.
The last poll I saw support for Isreal was at all.time high.  Don't take a bunch of 20 year olds as the will of the American people. [story about poll](https://www.axios.com/2023/10/26/generational-divide-on-the-israel-hamas-war)
Death. They‚Äôre trying to achieve death. They‚Äôre a nihilistic cult like ISIS, they just love killing people and creating mayhem.
Same child murderers as IDF. Only IDF is winning the competition.
Lame cop-out.
Couldn't tell you, I'm not Palestinian.
You're saying it was worth it?
 I watch it intentionally, but I do so on a personal device.
Ah yes, nothing more glorious than dying in a completely failed mission.
The first freedom bomb obviously lighted up some holy hamas war rockets.
I know you're probably joking but just to clear it out of the way; that's what happens when the rocket reaches its destination with far less fuel (if any) + the hospital wasn't hit that bad as they claim.
Coz Israel need the support from US to survive. And US will bail eventually under internal pressure. Look at the current outrage in the public and congress floor. Yet  the ground invasion hasn‚Äôt started.I wish Israel the best of luck. But I don‚Äôt see a winning scenario for them.
Yes It does good luck
That is indeed unfortunate. But proportional.
I think they're the dog that caught the car. They never thought their attack would succeed so well.
You can't kill an idea after all.
Why would it? This is existential for Israel. Has global outrage stopped Russia? The US is never going to sanction Israel. They will utterly dismember Hamas.
The first clip is clearly not because of secondaries.Those are multiple hits from the same type of weapon in a short time span (JDAM with delayed fuze to try and hit tunnels). The explosions are all exactly the same.We've seen that type of thin funnel shaped explosion so many times when used in Gaza by Israel to hit tunnels.Sad people here can't tell the difference between one massive explosion (say, from a weapons warehouse getting hit) to multiple of the same explosives hitting a concentrated area.Edit: they're even nicely spread apart and only hit the road so as to go as deep in to the ground as possible. Come on guys.

It's really nice to see the **sort** of protests the world saw in the 70s about 'Nam.Different countries, but same protest, "all we are saying, is give peace a chance" etc.  Or as in Roger Waters' song, **The Tide is Turning**?  But is it, though?
"In Fatman we trust" this dude is a legend in Barbados rn. We call him "Van Helsing"
Was the world talking about Palestinians 3 weeks ago ?
I saw this irl. I was videoing and watching through binoculars and I saw a big flash, now I know what it was
It‚Äôs interesting how there seems to be an uptick in Hamas rockets hitting Israeli civilian building but yet no outrage from the people who were claiming Israel is literally Hitler for any of the civilians they have killed.
I‚Äôd imagine after awhile you become a bit desensitized to it
It looks like they hit one of the underground tunnels where Hamas store rockets and other weapons. The explosions are venting out through the tunnel access points.
Unfortunately there is no avenue to ‚Äúwin‚Äù for Israel here. This is an idea, a concept, passed from generation to generation. Before Hamas it was the Fedeayean (sp?), Black September and so on. It just morphs and becomes more violent, reckless and sadistic than the last.
Whew wait til you see what they‚Äôre doing to people in Gaza (where those missing people also may be)
Absolute legend, good on him. He was like fk you if I'm dying you're dying too!!! Brave muthafkr
Absolutely brilliant !
That is just an Hamas war crime in the first video.
I'm so baffled what they thought was going to happen. I literally can't fathom that they expected the end state of this to yield a net positive for them.
How can they do it?You would get a rifle butt in your mouth at best.
You do know Hamas has zero control over the West Bank. So again, Why is the IDF targeting West Bank where there is no Hamas?
A weapons depot hit.
Only Israelis are this curious to see this shit. I'd do that too.
Actually, just for the sake of accuracy, it was the Islamic Jihad, but yes for the rest of it
Are you sure this is the 36th? They belong to the northern command
I‚Äôm an English teacher in England and his English is actually better than mine as well.
I agree
They did target tunnels in the first clip, the description says that. Don't think it was a controlled detonation though.  ground incursions didn't reach that far into gaza, I believe.
‚Äú600,000 people used to live in this city, now it's a ghost town.‚Äù Complete obliteration‚Ä¶ üò®
Which isn't really that much space when considering a strategic bombing plan

They‚Äôre finding out
Gaza is 5 times larger than Manhattan
I love this guy, holy smokes what a powerful statement."I'm not politically correct, I'm not your type... And I will not be!" *he said with a slight grin*
Yeah no Logic
However, the gobla outrage will stop Israel eventually.  Yest, it is still effective. Yes, people still buy it. Yes, seems young generation liberals in the west are Hamas's best ally.
Better than mine, and it's my only language
And fun fact: it's one of the only acronyms in English (AFAIK) that is the same in Dutch, where EOD stands for Explosieven Opruimings Dienst (although they use the official designation Explosieven Opruimingsdienst Defensie).
""accidentally""
Hamas isn't a thing that can be destroyed. After all this is over, no matter what happens, Hamas and Palestinian militancy will still exist in Gaza to undermine whatever the "after" is.
I saw that fire show at a Duran Duran concert. Maybe some Gasan wanted to reproduce it.
It's propaganda whether you emphasize with one group or the other. They are killing thousands of civilian Palestinians right now, bombings hospitals &amp; schools, how are they gonna justify it without propaganda.
At 0:50 they hit a street. Seems that under it was a tunnel with munition
Immigration without integration. ü§¨
They may have went too far (was burning people alive even in the official plan?), but let's see
How the fuck are there still buildings lol Gaza is like the size of my backyard
There's no question about it. Some mista'arvim unit is already in Gaza.
It should still stop rockers heading to low population but won't intercept those whom will fall in an open field. Also its 95% success rate
There is. The total destruction of Hamas. Then having Gaza ruled by an international consortium for a decade. This gives the Gazans a chance to have a decent life, the Arab countries to behave responsibly, and the Western world to breathe before the onslaught of the waves of terrorism prominent Arabs in the Middle East have been warning us about.
If I was hamas, I wouldn‚Äôt be so sure that Israel can‚Äôt stomach a full occupation/invasion.
Maglan is an elite recce unit that got organised quickly and killed a lot of goobers on the 7th. You can't draw any useful conclusions from a few seconds of contextless footage on a very chaotic day.
Your english is great mate
Same same
Wow, wth was that?!
You think I should have been thrown in an oven you sick fuck. This is the issue, right here! YOU ARE THE FUCKING PROBLEM. Go denounce your American citizenship and head to Gaza and join the fight you‚Äôre so passionate about. You want millions of people extinct! Seriously man FUCK YOU AND EVERTHING YOU STAND FOR. Another keyboard warrior. Rest in piss
They can weather this. The only way to end them is with a full force invasion and occupation, and they are sure that Israel don't have the stomach for the casualities that it would costI think they use the standard assymetric anti-western strategy of making the war too costly for the enemy until they eventually give up and go home. Unfortunately for them, israelis aren't going anywhere so this shit may continue until doomsday
Well said
I don‚Äôt know, ask your friends at Hamas.
So are there any protests within Gaza?Like people complaining that Hamas stores missiles under their homes? Or demanding the hostages to be released? Surely not everybody is radicalized, right?
I guess when you can't work, can't travel, have no control over your electricity, water, or future you just might eventually say wtf and do crazy stuff.
The first looks like tunnels were mined - can‚Äôt see any ordnance strike before the explosions. Note the explosions are all almost simultaneous which leads me to believe this was a controlled detonation following the recent ground incursion.
At the start they are talking about entering a certain building and how they should do it then it cuts to ?them being ambushed? The soldier in the vehicle is asking the soldier that's shooting if he can see any terrorist he then replies that he does he also said hamas trucks just passed by them after that they seem to start charging at the enemy as the video cuts out . Sorry for my bad English it's not my first language and I'm too lazy to paragraph this.
All you fucking lunatics that support fucking Hamas are truly demented. Girls at that PEACE festival were gang rapped so badly their pelvis is ruptured. Kids being slaughtered like cattle. Families being burned alive in their cars. DID Israel just start decimating Gaza for no reason. Your beloved Palestinian government knew exactly what would happen to their own people when they committed these atrocities. If you have some one to be upset with go explain this to your local terrorist. I‚Äôm so fed up of the poor me bullshit. Tell your fucking Islamic hero‚Äôs to show up to a battle field and fight like men instead of using the innocent as human shields. They hide among Palestinians that have nothing to do with this. If they would come fight like men the bombs would stop. But they are cowards who are willing to let everything and everyone die around them to save themselves!These are your fucking brave hero‚Äôs.Tell me where in the old testament where it said go kill Arabs ! YOU WONT FIND IT CAUSE IT DOES NOT FUCKING EXSIST YOU STUPID FUCK. These men think they are doing gods work. Well if they did gods work than why is your fucking country getting leveled right now?! I‚Äôll tell you why. Because only use that as an excuse to act on their own demented agenda. Do any of you Americans think Hammas would let you live no matter how much you love them!? You would be shot or beheaded on sight! WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE. I‚Äôm just glad I know who my neighbors are on my street! Now go enjoy the rest of your Jew hating day you twisted fucks
I would say that they try to figure out where are their opponents, and what they should do. In the meantime they use the vehicle as cover.Seems to me that they are in constant communication trying to figure out if there‚Äôs a force they should join, or if there‚Äôs a threat to which they should reposition. They speaks of Hamas jeeps arriving, and then a bit about contacts, and then they speak about mounting up their vehicle and there the footage stops.
They wanted to derail normalisation talks, push Palestine back to #1 on the global agenda, and trigger widespread international outrage at the Israeli response. The price? Palestinian civilians, who they don't give half a shit about.Hamas have been massively successful thus far and they haven't even traded the hostages yet. Israel can't win. They can exact revenge by killing lots of Palestinian assholes and civilians but there is just no avenue to winning for them here.
Just look at the demonstrations and attacks on Jews all across the world right now.. Hamas / ISIS knew exactly what they were doing and what the result would be. Personally I think that the Hamas declaration of war, rape pillage and murder spree was just too "successful" and it's backfired.
The death of innocent civilians in Gaza *is* a war crime, and that crime is being committed by Hamas not Israel. The use of human shields is in itself categorized as a specific intent war crime under the Geneva Convention and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court.
Irondome also can only intercept so many rockets I can be overwhelmed and then a small percentage of the rockets can actually hit some stuff Unfortunately iron dome will not be able to be 100% perfect
You saw a baby dragging a body through a street? Interesting
Every single Palestinian all 2 mil of them? Do you have proof of that?
What is the protocol? Wait 5 days?
that first one definitely hit something with munitions. so much destruction. i still don't understand what Hamas was trying to achieve. i think i never will
like Kirby said: "in this type of war civilian casualties are expected"
What assholes
Unfortunately have a look at the location of the underground arms depot
This is the never-ending story, and in the end, only the civilians who want to live in  peace get obliterated by a bomb, not the politicians, military generals, religious lunatics....
Wait until Hamas and looking up and see the A/10 warthog screeching at them
I have a little experience in this area, but I'm not an expert..I believe the danger at this point is fire from the rocket motor (although at this point that should be burned off or close to it) and the explosives burning, not detonating. To detonate the warhead of the rocket, a smaller detonation would have had to occur from another source (the fuze, which typically happens from the moment of impact, although you can have fancy systems that this is delayed or happens prior to hitting the ground, etc). Obviously, it is still not safe, but the risk of detonation at this moment is less.
Unfortunately it probably killed a lot of civilians. Easily 20-30 in that one strike alone.
The 1st strike is by far the most impressive, an underground ammo depot hit, nice seconderies.Also, the battalion commander of the west Khan Yunes battalion of Hamas was liquidated.
the victors in war is who manufactured the weapons
I wonder if terrorists are beginning to have pangs of regret over, you know, starting this shitü§î
By the 2 vehicles standing on the road they either spotted hamas terrorists or have been ambushed. In a situation like this you return fire from cover and can‚Äôt just charge the enemy
Yes, that's EOD's job, not firefighters'.
Consider this coming from a naive observer, but what is the significance of them gathering in one group behind this vehicle, while apparently the only returning fire is from this guy with the camera? Are they queuing up for an assault, or simply trying to desperately defend themselves?Update: thank you all for your insights. Really interesting
Your mum
You can easily notice that none of them are native Britons or Europeans.Muslims everywhere just hate Israelis
Attacks came from West Bank too. All of you acting like Israel was the one that attacked first were not watching the world as it actually is
Well in Ukraine it is covered by insurance, because it's not an act of war, it's a 3-day special military operation! Sorry, lame joke.
üòÇ no it wasn't. It wasn't even a country, nevermind an Arab one.
If they wanted to they could, the numbers don't add up.   The number of Palestinians in Israel, the west bank and Gaza are all growing over decades.  There is less than half an injured person per a bomb that the IDF airforce drops that blows up two stories in one of the most dense areas in the worlds. And that is by Hamas reported number that includes people it hit itself.   While Hamas like the PLO used to have a declared "kill all the Jews" in their declared goals
I am not sure what "sources" you have, but they sound delusional. Just because Israel was caught by surprise by a bunch of rapists and murderers doesn't mean it is "fucked". Israel's army is the best in the shithole we call the "Middle East" and probably much better than a lot of nations globally. Hamas and Hezbollah are delusional terrorists brainwashed by their hateful, genocidal religion.
I've seen these exact posters through CBDs in cities in New Zealand. It's definitely organised, I'm surprised more people here don't recognise them.
While IDF has activity in the west bank including blocks to limit movment it's not a closed area, they have open borders with Jordan, there is trade, there is people movement, it's easier to smuggle things and people into the west bank than it is to Gaza.   There are Hamas people inside the West Bank and there are relatives of Hamas people in Gaza. There are militant activities from the west bank against Israelis, more common with knifes and guns than rockets.
This whole event has absolutely proven that a whole lot of people are not capable of that amount of decency.
Hamas and Islamic Jihad rockets are junk. How can anyone believe zionist propaganda that they can blow up a hospital  even after being shot down? They don't have firepower to do so.
And yet they say a POS rocket just like that killed 500 at the Al-Ahli hospital ü§î
Hello, it looks like you've made a mistake.It's supposed to be could've, should've, would've (short for could have, would have, should have), never could of, would of, should of.Or you misspelled something, I ain't checking everything.Beep boop -¬†yes,¬†I¬†am¬†a¬†bot, don't botcriminate me.
I think so too, he used a term fire fighters usually use to describe a fire
Coz they want to erase the people of Palestinian and take the rest of Palestinian and make it all israel there nasty people Hitler should of done em all before they took the land of the Palestinians
These bombs take out 3 floors of a building in a direct hit as you can see in vids.  ed numbers? (which also includes Gazan's killed by Hamas, for example, the 500 bodies they counted within 5 minutes of their own rocket hitting the hospital)  These bomb take out 3 floors of a building in a direct hit as you can see in vids.  Gaza is considered one of the most densely populated areas on earth.  You think they don't know where to hit if they want maximum kills  and asking half of them to move south just concentrates it  Do you think a bomb shouldn't kill 50-300 ppl at the minimum if they were targeting max kills?  There would have been over 100,000 kills if the aim was to kill the people of Gaza and that's just the first 3 days worth IIRC, we are now over 2 weeks in.  Also for some reason, the Arab Palestine population in both Israel, the West Bank and Gaza continues to steadily grow over decades.  IDK how you can justify the math
There are over 1000 Palestinians detained without trial in Israel (known officially as administrative detention). Is that materially different than a kidnapping? It is still armed people snatching people off the street.
The argument is that Jews have been in the lands long before any Muslims made the claim and then after being driven out brought some land back and then got attacked because Muslims disagreed with Jews living there. Ever since then all aggression has been started by Muslims states. 1948 Arab Israeli war was started by the Arab league. 6 day war that was started by Egypt and Syria and they lost to Israel (then Israel got Gaza and tried to hand it back) Egypt Syria  have it ago again in 1967 and lost. Then Isreal got West Bank from Syria as the victors. I can go on but if the Arabs didn‚Äôt start wars with the Jews all the time they wouldn‚Äôt be in this situation.Look up Palestinian land purchase. No colonising by the Jews here.
Basically War Thunder CAS :'(
Dumb bombs would be much more difficult to use due to altitude the planes are flying at (they have MANPADS). Plus the risk of civilian deaths go up tremendously.
Pronounced "shitter"
Dude, they just wiped out around a thousand Hamas fighters in about 48 hours three weeks ago, by mostly fighting house to house. I think they're going to be fine.
Well the Ukrainians have been under bombardment for nearly two years now against munitions that are significantly more potent than what Hamas is firing, them going to ground makes sense.Israel has been experiencing regular rocket strikes for the last 22 years*. A significant portion of the IDF have grown up experiencing these regular rocket strikes and a usual lack of damage from them.*: A Wikipedia article claimed Hamas' affair with rockets began in 2001. That seemed more or less right from my memory, so I ran with it.
‚ÄúJust so you know BC is before AD‚Äù yeah no shit sherlock. Make an argument instead of posting wiki links. Man never went to school.
The cameraman who lives, never dies.He reminds me of those Tsunami videos where all the people wandered out to the beach when the water receded "why why why" and then the waves came back. He should be running for cover -- bullets do fly.
I like to imagine how the terrorists shat their pants when they realized an Israeli cruiser was in the way of their massacre joyride."Oh noes!"Nothing they could really do in their little speedboats with small arms but kiss their asses goodbye.Same with the terrorists who recently tries to infil underwater in scuba gear.Israel's Navy is doing a top notch job being a massive pain in the ass for these rats.

explosive ordinance disposal
They want to kill all the Arabs
Seems a bit pointless really, every building is levelled in one of the overhead shots, could have just used dumb ammo and achieved the same thing.
If the navy wasn't there, those would be his last minutes.
FCK Hamas. Honestly.
These raids are also giving cover for insertion of SOF elements, I bet.
Lick finger, pount it to the sky, guess which way the wind is blowing....
They must be somewhat comfortable with iron dome stocks considering they keep pushing back the gaza occupation
last thing you want to be feeding unexploded ordnance is fresh air through a cupboard door.
Yeah lmao this is exactly me. I wish I was a cute skinny femboi but I'm a 250 lbs 5 ft 9 bear so I decided to get buff as fuck lmao
Didn't mean to come across as though you were defending IOF, apologies that I did. Mostly just wanted to expand on why Israel's narrative should be taken with a hefty salt lick.
Does EOD mean explosive on demand?
Yea Israel has complete air superiority over Gaza so it can pretty much do what it wants unlike Ukraine which is contested by both sides so you don‚Äôt really see this type of leveling of buildings in that war
I think you‚Äôre on to something. The way the posters are put up, the way the posters look the same. It doesn‚Äôt look like the parents or loved ones of the hostages that have put this up. I don‚Äôt know who of course, but it looks organized. And while the kidnapping situation is bad, there is probably many missing Palestinians in this conflict too. That may make Palestinians feel that as you say, that the posters are propaganda. I really hope humanity can find a way to live without conflict, war and violence. I hope more people see the importance of honesty. And compassion.
I'm aware of those incidents. I'm not trying to defend the IDF or its actions, mind you.  I was replying to someone who falsely claimed the tweet they linked was Israel confirming that they specifically targeted that journalist's family, and my point is simply that we should stick to the facts. Likewise I acknowledge the discrepancies between what Israel has claimed regarding past airstrikes that hit media offices and the (lack of) evidence backing them up, and yes that does call to question the validity of their claims and potential motives.
The after of this is some great footage, the Israeli Navy did a great job taking out the trash.
Hamas, as their government, should be the ones delivering aid to their OWN people, instead it prefers to send missiles that will 90% of time get shotdown and do terrorist attacks that result in more death for the Palestinians.
Guy was like"Im not locked in here with you, you're locked in here with me"
You are way too cynical for someone who probably resides in a democratic country. For starters, 5 of the hostages are British nationals. Secondly, showing the faces of the hostages might activate conscientious citizens in countries with deep diplomatic ties with Israel (like the UK) in order to put international pressure on the Israelis to prioritize the welfare of the hostages over their military objectives in the forthcoming ground operation. Someone might see the missing persons fliers and phone the office of their MP.
He seemed pretty calm, I would be running and screaming myself. :/
Have you seen the aftermath footage from the ground? The IDF still levels complete blocks, they just need fewer bombs for it than the russians.
Source for your numbers?
It‚Äôs because Hamas is shit at it not for lack of trying 7590 rockets shot over Israel‚Äôs border this month.https://rocketalert.live
SOX STRIKES AGAIN!
No unless they‚Äôre stacked. If you‚Äôre using this logic to say it wasn‚Äôt what hit the hospital, it doesn‚Äôt apply as 500 didn‚Äôt die and the damage was done to a parking lot
Hope those guys stay in jail for life. Attempted murder over a car robbery? What scum bags.
I read that in Murr's voice.
Kingdom of Judah 930 bchttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_JudahKingdom of Israel https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_of_Israel_(Samaria)both of these are now modern day Israel. Muslim faith came into existence in 610 ADJust so you know BC is before AD and Jews where in the land over 1500 years before Muslim faith became a thing
Hamas has boats? They barely have bullets!?!
That home is in Rishon LeZion, which was founded by Jewish pioneers in 1882 on land purchased for them by a Jerusalem-born Jewish businessman from the local Sephardi community who was also serving as the British vice-consul in Jaffa.
Imagine a fishing boat putting off a wake like that. The people who believe this shit
Always impressed about the precision they work these targets in such a densely built area. Bombs/ missiles coming in from 2 or even 3 sides at the exact same time and with perfect precision. A complete difference to the stuff we saw in Ukraine the last years where complete blocks got leveled.
&gt;ROCKET INSIDEYou all have seen rocket in pocket, but are you ready for kazzam in closet?
Lol that's a lie, leaders negotiate all the time with terror and militia groups often enough. The USA does it, Israel does it, Europe does it etc. Even just now, it was US pressure and working with Qatar that got 4 US citizens freed by Hamas. Many foreign policy experts also believe Israel is leading secret negotiations behind the scenes but doesn't want the public to know to not appear week.Getting your people back is often very important for public morale and public support of your leadership.
Completely agree. We‚Äôre all entitled to our view on the geopolitical issues here, what none of us are entitled to is an opinion on the value of innocent civilian‚Äôs lives. Every single death should be condemned and warrants our compassion.
I bet you the safety was on.
I think this would be a much more compassionate, and more powerful, move.

Open borders... Until Hamas decided to turn to more violence.
"And in this room, we keep the fire and UXO"
I don't think people should tear them down but what is the purpose of having them hanging in London or anywhere outside of Israel other than propaganda to support what Israel are currently doing to the people in Gaza? The hostages need to be freed but ironically the method Israel is using is more likely to get them killed by an airstrike.
Are you going to blame every single conflict? Because children do not exclusively exist here.
It's not incorrect. Once the Ottoman Empire conquested the region. They genocided the Jews too. Only took 1000years, after the fall of the Ottomans, for the Jews to return.
That‚Äôs one long leap in logic, in your assuming the worst in Israeli intentions. Mind you, these are human beings behind the government while with their own intentions (maybe even to what you describe) you also have to realize that there are many levelheaded people Highup in power as well. My point is don‚Äôt assume the worst in people unless you‚Äôre absolutely 100% sure. And don‚Äôt assume the best in people if they appear to be victims. There‚Äôs no one good guy or bad guy but people like you and me with interests. To be fully honest the most levelheaded of hammas (not the terrorists) as well as within the Israeli government want this war to end. Because in reality, the majority of these people in power are not the pinnacle of evil. It‚Äôs really disheartening to see how radicalized people have become because the actions of the bad few who‚Äôs gotten the medias attention. TLDR: be a little bit more levelheaded and optimistic about people and their point of view.
The amount of ballistics experts who appeared out of nowhere after the reported hospital attack was insane.
You confuse Nazis with the German people. Both sides suffer. However, the Nazis were voted in by the people. And the Nazis refused to give up and fought to the bitter end all the way into Berlin. No one complained then, no one should complain now.
Martyrdom
Yes, they frequently use flares.
No one here defends terrorism. Because of three decades of experience using human shields and blaming Israel for their own failures, Hamas seems to be the only terrorist here.

This took place in central Gaza. From the details I've heard so far, the troops found a tunnel and the Hamas fighters inside were then attacked by ground and air forces. Hamas anti-tank positions and command and control centers were also attacked, as were Hamas operatives trying to escape.
Xitter
but both make no difference, like some other comments said these posters won't help find those kids. It's just propaganda. to those who tore them down it's just propaganda to those who put them up it's propaganda. So all in all no differences were made on either side.
Cool your fucking 767s dude. The anti-Muslim hysteria after 9/11 was literally so bad that republicans have been coasting off of it for 22 years.
Lmao, funny
This was a gta San Andreas mission
There is a difference between feeling better about yourself for raising awareness about innocent people who were abducted, and feeling better about yourself for tearing down posters of innocent people who were abducted. The latter is despicable.
I would be highly anxious if I had a smoking inshallah rocket in my house.

AlJazeera  and r/news be like: "Israeli man sets Palestinian home on fire"
She clearly would not have any need to as he already has chased her away from the car and quickly changed his attention to the other people going close to the car. You could almost say he is reacting like that because someone else is in the car and he doesn't want the mob to attack them. And instead gets the attention to himself.
Because....evil
Isreal is doing what a bully does...hits on people who can't fight back...they have no weapons...just bricks..there is no Hamas in the West Bank because Isreal controls the concentration camp... anyone who tells you otherwise is lying...IDF thinks every young Palestinians in the West Bank is a terrorist.... IDF is creating a new generation of Hamas supporters in the West Bank and Gaza with its War Crimes....but it comes with the blessings of USA and European countries...
If seeing that stroller in there isn't eye opening enough for how disgusting this war is ilthen humanity is dfucked.
The world is a shit fucking place.
I'd like to think that *THUMP* in the last second of the video was the driver throwing them against the van!
I'll take that bet. How much are we talking about?
People confused Germans and Nazis in WW2, too.  That's war for ya.
60% of the time, it works 100% of the time
Seems like a good time to bring up their intentional attacks on international media offices. In 2021 they targeted towers that housed local and international media, levelling them. They also claimed that they were targeting Hamas.[Targeted Israeli airforce attacks have destroyed the premises of 23 Palestinian and international media outlets in the past week.](https://rsf.org/en/rsf-asks-icc-prosecutor-say-whether-israeli-airstrikes-media-gaza-constitute-war-crimes)&gt;The latest airstrikes destroyed the bureaux of the US news agency, the Associated Press, and the Qatari TV broadcaster Al Jazeera.

Blinken said he has pressed Israel for justification.
Yup. Just got banned from the 'therewasanattempt' sub last night because they updated their rules to be a meme about any kind of criticism of Palestine being a bannable offense.Meanwhile, totally cool to post anti-Semitic stuff and posts justifying the October 7th attacks. Israel = bad, Hamas = good.My reply was to someone saying roughly 'Israel should have kept their heads down, now they're going to learn'. Again, about the October 7th attacks. Straight up victim blaming. This tribalistic shit is sickening. It's worse than the hysteria after 9/11.
Gosh, I wonder which hospital they were actually aiming for.
Schade
He is not instigating a fight. He was running in circles around his car to protect it. And then got attacked by a mob. He then pulled a gun as a deterrent. And got arrested it's lucky for him because as soon as they figure out he is not gonna shoot it's definitely a death sentence.

Hamas literally sought out civilian victims... so not everyone agrees.

DON‚ÄôT ROCKETOPEN   INSIDE
He definitely was only defensive else it would have escalated quickly. Lucky he had a gun as a deterrent or he would have been beaten to death.
Funny how I don't live anywhere close but the power blinked on and off right when this happened.
they been plottin
They tear them because it's Israeli propaganda, I have seen the same flyers at my country Chile, those flyers don't want to help searching for those civilians, their porpoise it's to make some pro-israeli propaganda. That's why people
This dude has to be stoned as shit rn, he is saying "heres an attack, live. Why,why,why(israeli slang for wow, even though we say wow too lol). Who's boat is this? On my mother, that's a boat of terrorists!" All the while *not de-assing himself from that beach while a Haji boat‚Ñ¢ is gunning it towards him*. What a madlad
"I do love humans", while ripping the posters off the wall..Yeah Right B. Just not Jewish Humans !
Take my upvote...
How is Israel doing "state terrorism"?Is defending your country's sovereignty "terrorism"?I swear leftists have lost their mind.
Crewed by starving babies and women. Don't forget that part in your story
Reminds me of something that the stooges would do.
State terrorism is actual terrorism, too, and I don't think I said I support Islamic terrorism? Oct 7 wasn't just Islamists thoEdit: Yeah, typical r/combatfootage take where history begins on October 7, 2023
So you support Islamic terrorism? Actual terrorists. Okay.Edit: you wanna know why they support Israel? It's because they saw the Hamas atrocities before they were censored by Reddit.
Insane takes never fail to amaze me.
Very serious situation, but him being like ‚Äúope i think it‚Äôs in this closet. Yup its in there‚Äù is hilarious
And also, bitch you need a grammar lesson.
i literally clicked on this post to forget that. why would you remind me
Not dead sea
The only correct reaction
Fwiw, this isn't the first time in this war that they've used battlefield illumination. I commented about it on Oct 7th after seeing it on the livestream.
Oh man you showed me by using a less intelligent way of say what I just said to you. Jesus what a moron. And speaking of Jesus you know he walked the streets of Israel. That‚Äôs should give you a tiny indication of how long ago Israel was there. I just feel for the man that ends up with this mistake in biology that is you.
From all the times I've seen this video, I've never noticed this... Driver got extremely lucky.
This rocket alone killed 500
No need for justification the 7th was enough to keep going until Hamas is deleted
Bitch u need a history lesson
its an extremely complicated situation/history half the population of gaza is under 16, they are very much on social media and they are really good at it. Most people get consumed threw the lens of their feelings, so which ever side embeds first, couple in all the weird qanon antisemetic theories and things. It resonates with people. I saw a palestinian/confederate flag sticker today.
MINUS 15000 SOCIAL CREDITS
dude this is like the 2nd video I‚Äôve ever seen of Israel getting bombed, but I see 10 a day of Gaza lmfao
This is asshole behavior regardless of the nationality of the victim. Wtf is wrong with people
Apparently, Israeli children don‚Äôt matter.
you think Jews were there first LMAOOO is your source the Bible? learn some actual history idiot
Come on Risky, you can make the difference between hamas and Palestinians, you smooth brain dog
FRAUD!!
Unless i'm confusing two events, the Japanese found her still afloat the next day and finished her off with destroyer long-lance torpedoes.
Not bombing the fk out of people gives them a better life in general
I didn‚Äôt say all of them but if they choose too , what‚Äôs wrong with that they could have a chance at a different life that could possibly be better . But that be an outcome if the option isn‚Äôt offered ?
He didn't want that smoke
He knows his insurance company won‚Äôt believe his claim without the video lol.‚ÄúSir, you said the multiple holes in your ceiling were‚Ä¶from a rocket?‚Äù

Easy, switch to LED bulbs and use a bicycle instead of a car for short commutes, that should save you a lot in electricity and fuel
Yeah the comment section of r/combatfootage is pretty much an onanistic orgy of folks who openly support Israeli state terrorism
And yes they did vote for them as westbank voted for fata.
Yet they are in the streets supporting them as they parade dead Israeli corpses through Gaza? The lack of actual intelligence on this subject is astounding.
That's the part he came to an hour ago.
Ah, another shill for state terrorism

Arafat fucked up and ultimately created this situation.
I can‚Äôt even understand the first part of this which shows me the level of intelligence I‚Äôm dealing with here. Israeli people were booted from those lands far before the Palestinians went their. They were killed and conquered by the Napoleon, the Roman‚Äôs, the Ottoman Empire just to name a few. Palestinians went there by way of one of these empires. Can you guess which one? So your level of understanding on this is backwards so maybe actually do some history research before you go slaughtering a sentence to feel smart.
Palestinian shouldn‚Äôt have moved to people who didn‚Äôt leave there even But what can I say once a colonizer always a colonizer
It literally belonged to them there is dead that say Jerusalem or Palestinian when they look at there house deed
Also that the reason many Palestinians left, was because of other middle eastern countries threatening to attack israel. They would rather leave than risk dying.
It was an Arab country
Lol, it‚Äôs not even porn!
Lol. My science teacher did the same thing when I was in 7th grade. He put on a bootleg dvd of a Dave Chapelle standup and walked out to go smoke a joint probably, when the movie was over it cut to him railing some woman in a bathroom. He walked in and saw it playing and just nonchalantly shut the tv off, laughed and didn‚Äôt say a word. Next day was normal as if nothing happened, none of us really gave a shit and a couple of us fist bumped the teacher, I can‚Äôt imagine if this type of shit happened today it would be all over the news and the guy would be fired.
Can't imagine those premiums right now.
At 10 o'clock in the morning; in *this* part of Israel; located entirely within your child's bedroom?
It‚Äôs true Israel did not confirm. It‚Äôs a journalist commenting on it. Why people are focusing on it is this part of the quote ‚ÄúGenerally we know the target. For example, today there was a target: the family of an Al Jazeera reporter. In general, we know.‚Äù
I was gonna ask "what rangefinder doing"
It's never been insanely effective, during operation cast lead they only took out about 10% of Hamas's rockets. The reason their rocket attacks haven't been very effective is that the rockets themselves are cheap and poorly aimed, about of a 3rd of them never make it out of Gaza and most of the ones that "hit" Israel land in the middle of nowhere.
Holy fuck I cannot handle when people post videos to the internet and say that it JUST happened. Like buddy, what the fuck? Do you think everyone is going to see the video the goddamn moment you post it? Like, do you understand how the internet works?
I suppose Israel should just allow this to keep happening right?

This is an alt account, so coming back after a week just to see your comment "Fuck You" to a Delete just made me genuinely laugh.
i find christians annoying  too...they didn't signal before they made the turn
No matter your opinion that you think is so important to share about the conflict between Israel and Hamas. This is some demented shit
Where the hell is "Matzliah"? It ain't on Google maps
Don't argue with the hasbara man they've hired too many and some are clearly subpar.
Rather than tearing them down, why don't people put flyers of all the dead Palestinian children?Seems like a better approach. Civilians are civilians.
Can you elaborate? I'm completely ignorant on this topic.
He literally yells I WANT MY MUDDAH (mother)
Fuck dude, me too.
Hamas is really out here building these Looney Tune Rockets
Well elon has just committed arson with twitter, among most other social media becoming absolutely (even more) terrible in recent history. I hate all of it way more now including reddit api stuff, but clearly, they all get plenty of traffic because we're addicts.
Funny thing is the lack of outrage here. Hamas for 20 years firing rockets at random targets in Israel, no one cares, but outrage about a fake story about a hospital being hit.
I‚Äôd say they were using crossfire as a metaphor for the ongoing conflict, not trying to say it was literal crossfire.
wiki page   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline\_of\_the\_2023\_Israel%E2%80%93Hamas\_war  This has an event timeline (Arab supporting source) [https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/7/what-happened-in-israel-a-breakdown-of-how-the-hamas-attack-unfolded](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/10/7/what-happened-in-israel-a-breakdown-of-how-the-hamas-attack-unfolded)Abit more neutral source running a similar story[https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-hamas-attack-israel-unfolded-2023-10-07/](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/how-hamas-attack-israel-unfolded-2023-10-07/)
Fuck outta here, comrade. Russia is going down with Iran.

Found the zeigeist movie producer.
Plainly inaccurate statement. To say that Arabs colonized Jewish people is just incorrect. The only narrative that fits this statement is yours, and again it‚Äôs just wrong.
In that video you can see a genocidal occupier illegally targetting a Palestinian peace suicide preschool that is filled with mentally disabled toddlers.
Actually 2-10 fighters did reach Ashkelon, and it took the IDF like 30 hours to get rid of them. (The Arabic sources said 10 fighters, the Israeli sources said 2 fighters)This actually indicates how fucked Israel are if they actually do a land invasion. Their record in the past 20 years is one of the worst on land, they‚Äôre not at all prepared or good enough to fight a tunnels guerrilla war.
Oh that's lame. I liked looking back to see what people had awarded.

Huh, I just noticed the "Gilded" section in profile that let you review your awarded posts has also apparently been removed.That's a shame.
That's exactly what I mean with the suspect distribution system. I think Reddit will end up keeping most of the money because the paid upvotes will go to people or bots who will end up not being eligible for payout for whatever reasons Reddit decides.
Lmao well then see above video
Ah yes. Logic and reason. Logic and reason with your terrorist apologist attitude.Youre not smart or coy. You're just an ignorant af liberal who's mad that for once a country didn't resort to "thoughts and prayers" after a tragedy. Right? Isn't that what you people do? Laugh at the idea of thoughts and prayers? Now what? You're mad that a country actually does something in response? There's no pleasing your side and that's mainly why I smile at every Israeli strike video in Gaza.Thoughts and prayers.

Or maybe just letting a few slip in to keep justification of strong retaliation going? Go ahead, downvote me.
Fight or flight are both fear responses.

Well duhhh. Of course that‚Äôs the  right thing . We all know Iran wants nothing but death for Israel. At least the rulers do.
Hamas will now say that this was targeted and they meant to cut off electricity, but in reality it‚Äôs just coincidence; spray and pray!
welllllllll all of gaza is pretty much missing right now, sooooooooo
Do you have any statistics to back this up or is this an assumption?Would 9/11ing moscow be morally fine because a "lot of russians" are pro Z? This is so far above and beyond identity politics it is insane.
Imagine being so braindead you can't possibly make a distinction between a terrorist organization and civilians and then go on to conflate the two.
If this was actually a genocide Israel would have carpet bombed Gaza into atomic dust by now.

No
These people will never view each other as human beings, only enemies. What a miserable existence.
You are either a troll or genuinely retarded.
Iron dome extrapolates the trajectory of the incoming rockets and then prioritizes to take out those headed toward dense civilian or strategic sites. It will allow rockets predicted to fall in low population areas through. However it‚Äôs only about 85-90% effective for targets it attempts to intercept.

There's IDF gun camera footage of this, the zodiac blows apart. But the footage is black and white so don't if its thermal of an earlier night attack on another similar boat on that day.
well if America put the kkk into goverment power your simile might have some grounds..
What's crazy to me is how used to this both sides are.  They just stand around filming incoming rounds.  It didn't take the Ukrainians 24 hours to find every storm-shelter, basement, and subway station to use as bomb shelters when the sirens go off.  Sure, they've gotten a bit more lax as the war drags on, but not like this.
Welcome to whose war crime is it anyways? Where are the rules are made up and the points don't matter.

There's a theory that it's due to the us Congress passing some laws that means to crack down on things like lootcrates and crypto in one fell swoop, but the wording is vague and also generally reddit coins fit the description so they're trying to quietly get ahead of it by pretending they never sold coins to begin with.

kind of how the world works when you fight in wars and lose. like ww1 they got land and ww2. they lost it.  It shouldnt come as a shock of who owns what. War determines that..
It's not, but i think you're talking about Sook-Yin Lee who was a Muchmusic VJ and did a movie called Shortbus.
Perhaps in a kibbutz for personal self defense and how to potentially fight off an aggressor. But there are no children in the Israeli military. Mandatory conscription isn‚Äôt until 18.
Aside from an open field, fighting in an urban environment is both the most dangerous and difficult. Every window, corner and crevice is a threat until its cleared. It is a slow and brutal process to fight building to building in a tight environment.
Too soon. Still ill from the first time seeing that.

hey they could be hamas sr.edit they are in fact older
So its okay to detonate a hospital but when it acctually flies across the border and hits something. Nah man
the same amount as someone who put them up. Both sides can feel a little better about themselves while contributing nothing and making no difference to society.
I recall reading about the same thing happening in a 1970's kibbutz - teaching kids hand-to-hand combat.  Is it preparing kids or indoctrination?  Judgement is in the eye of the beholder.  If I was raising my boys anywhere within 500km of Gaza, I'd make damn sure they knew UXO &amp; gun safety - regardless of which border we lived inside.

What are you talking about (aside from "y'all" not being a real term)? Are you seriously trying to make such a ridiculous statement? Where are you from? What is your background?
You doughnut. If Israel wanted to kill every living thing in Gaza, they could do it TOMORROW. If they were really doing what you claim they are doing, Gaza would be uninhabited right now.
Wonder what cameramen said
Have to wonder if they're running low or relocating/preserving launchers for the northern front. I'd bet the latter but if they are running low they're going to be in major trouble if Hez joins in.
Exactly. They can't get simple food and water into Gaza, but they can get what they need to build and launch thousands of rockets.
Yeah, I‚Äôm an athlete myself. I 100% for a fact know you are not, and lack knowledge when it comes to this topic. Have a good day.

Summer camps in Gaza are Hamas training drills. There was a video on here closer to the beginning of all this that shows them training children ages maybe 10 and up, maybe even 8?
neither is stealing homes at gunpoint or shooting people in the streets
Full video plz
Israel has EOD, I've trained with and seen them at Eglin when i was in USAF EOD school back in 2011(i washed out in Ground and became a mechanic haha, my brother has been doing it for almost 20 years though) most US allies come here for EOD experience
Oh i see thanks for explaining! I am just annoyrd how they dont see hamas is killibg israelis and innocent civilians from palestine too
So the USA is an open air prison? We don't have open borders. You can't just walk into Canada and Mexico.
No, I don't think that is what he meant by his comment. Yes, there are innocent Palestinian civilians that are not Hamas, but there are plenty that support Hamas, and Hamas continues to do terrible things and must be stopped. All those so-called "protestors" out there saying ignorant things about freeing Palestine, and pretending that everything is one sided, are who this comment is for.
It already is inhabitable,  Isreal has cut all there resources across the border including power and provided no civilian aid while clearly stating they had no intentions of providing any further assistance to any citizens in Gaza .. They've already systematically leveled entire city blocks .. The people of Gaza might be on the strip still but the city of Gaza doesn't exist anymore in turns of supporting a population.. Good luck rebuilding that,  Id love to see bidding contract on rebuilding in that nightmare .. No country in the world wants to touch Gaza right now .. The stakes are high.. Only conflict in the world where no outside organizations are actively trying to remove civilians from a war zone .. For good reason too as we could be about to watch the middle east implode on itself.. It's not about lives over there , the symbolism of a Palestinian refugees leaving the Gaza strip gives jet fuel to every extremist group in the middle east ,and every country is riddled with them ..Eypt itself is one wrong move away from a government revolt ..

I would imagine it would be quite hard to sink a CVN. Look at the damage Forrestal (not a CVN, but still a supercarrier) and Enterprise suffered during their fires off Vietnam during the Vietnam war. Just the size alone would make them stupidly hard to sink, and combined with good damage control crews, as long as the fires don‚Äôt remain out of control and get contained, and that any breaches in the hull do not penetrate too far, they could stay a float and habitable.Repairing them though would be an absolute pain in the ass
Jews spitting on Christians the way Nazis spitting on Jews when they took power in Germany in 1933.  Israel is one big Stockholm syndrome!
MmmHmm, you are also missing the excuse  of innocent children being killed , your also the missing the excuse of innocent adults being killed but what exactly is your point? You got a reasonable, executable solution to end this ? or just trying to beat your chest with a moral high ground for the team you choose to stand with ..

Jewish state of Israel has no constitution for one reason to preserve the apartheid state that treats Palestinians the same way the Nazis of Germany treated Jews in Europe from 1934 to 1945.  Israel has become a fascist totalitarian state and its democracy is a sham!  Netenyahu will bring about Israel's ruin, like so many fascist totalitarian leaders of the past destroyed their countries in an endless war of hate against a perceived enemy.
Well, here in Ukraine we have special insurance that covers damage from drones or missiles strikes.

For perspective, how do modern carriers compare in terms of toughness? There are people cheering on the destruction of the US carriers stationed in the Mediterranean right now and I can't help but wonder how impossible it would be to sink one.369 additional 5" shells and countless torpedoes couldn't do it, and it was already listing hard. Are today's less hardy?
Casualties happen in war. Hamas instigated this war. You should be thankful the death count isn't higher.
So you're OK with rockets killing babies, as long as they're Israeli. Is that correct?
Korean actress Kim Soo-ji. At least that's what someone said in another Reddit thread.
This is obviously cgi‚Ä¶. /s
Couldn't say for sure, just chucking a dime in the possibility Box. True about the drone though, must be like white noise torture by now for those below, its intrusive and persistent.
...not to mention the way you have to qualify to cash out...you'd basically have to start a bot farm to stand a chance of ever seeing any cash, let alone think about actual income.
Carpet bombing with the intent of genocide has this effect.
I think if Israel really cared about these hostages they would be trying to get them back rather than bombing every building they might be inside.
At some point they have to start deciding to defend civilian targets or military targets with the dome. They might not have enough ammunition to defend both. They definitely don't if Hezbollah joins in and manages to launch rockets effectively.
You know both can be wrong right?
these homes were built by Israelis.

This is so fking scary but hilarious at the same time.
You will always hear a drone in Gaza lol, you can't the hear a helicopter in the video but I assume it meant the helicopter lunched that missle from far away.
They want all Israelis to suffer the same fate
Yet here you are, giving your expert opinion
Looks like a transformer was hit.
Ahh, yeah that‚Äôs correct.
You wish to blame Israel for defending itself. You refuse to address or acknowledge that Hamas is initiating attacks against Israeli woman and children within the vicinity of Palestinian woman and children. Your argument is morally bankrupt and devoid of logic.
Instead of tearing off flyers they could've added to the wall flyers about how Palestinians are dying as well and then the wall would've shown the bigger picture about how war affects civilians on both sides hence why it should come to an end to protect them both.
It's the age where everyone is a expert but also simultaneously has no idea what they're talking about.
Happy to help but the real hero is OP
Maybe a miss understanding from Arabic or Hebrew translation for the wording regarding drone/helicopter. Could be wrong but I can clearly hear a drone so maybe its just a simple translation error ü§î
Looks a lot like warning shots to me.
Doubt the internal community let's that happen. And I feel like they could be well on their way to doing that and have chosen not to already.
I‚Äôm trying to understand the motivation behind it. Best I can come up with is Palestinian people or Palestinian empathizers see these hostage posters as propaganda. The people on the posters are not in London and people in London aren‚Äôt really going to be able to find the people on the posters. So they see this as an act of propaganda to stir emotions to the side of Israel. Maybe they see it as hateful when there are no posters of the missing or dead Palestinian children?

The fact you cannot see the absolute insanity of 5,000 deaths, shows your level of morals. Those are women, children. You‚Äôre such an ignorant person, this is why the world laughs at America. You‚Äôre uneducated
Nothing you just said justifies the deaths of 5,000 civilians, regardless of the actions of Hamas those people do not deserve to die. But you‚Äôre morals are fucked so what am I even saying
You sure that's a helicopter?
No get some reading comprehension.  Hamas were/are.  Hamas were/are firing at Israeli woman and children.  Israel fires back.  Hamas just suck and don't have Iron dome so more of Israel's salvos make it through.  This is going to continue.  One of three things that can be done 1) Hamas can stop launching attacks near Palestinian woman and children  2)Hamas can surrender 3) Palestinian's can move away from the area when they see Hamas launch attacks.  The ball is completely in Hamas and the Palestinians court.
Palestinian Islamic Jihad by most accounts. Though it's very much a potato-potahto distinction.
The electricity tit for tat wars.
Im sorry, we must not have realized Hamas was *innocently* firing thousands of rockets in the direction of civilian population centers or decapitating children and civilians (*innocently* of course)
Why are you making shit up I never mentioned anything about anyone being killed, what is wrong with you, are you one those NYU students that want to kill American Jews? Do you enjoy seeing Jews getting slaughtered in their homes, tortured in front of their kids and parents? You must also enjoy the Pittsburgh synagogue massacre too I assume? See I can make shit up about you too, grow up
Most countries would of leveled the place long ago , including every middle eastern country . The existence of gaza is simply a means of destabilization now .At this point the Palestinians in gaza have become nothing but scarfical pawns by extremists to attack progression in multiple middle eastern country's.. You can very much veiw hamas terrorist attack as an attempt to instigate a Arab spring but in reverse.. A invasion of Isreal isn't the immediate goal , discord,   Civil wars, and revolts in other surrounding countries is .. We are not to far off , just wait and see what happens once any other Middle Eastern country accepts refugees from the Gaza strip .
Looks like a human version of Donkey Kong driving his Mario Kart.
You mean the one that accidentally flew back to China,  in a time machine.
Yea imagine how the Palestinian parents of the many children that were killed feel. There hasnt been a day with out a lifeless child was pulled from a bombed building.
Ideologies are.
They summon a demon from the underworld to whip you a million times while all the aborted Chinese girls sing you nursery rhymes with bleeding eyes and you‚Äôre always in a state of just remembering you‚Äôve left the oven on at home
Where the hell did I say that? I said it wasn't occupied for 75 years and that it has not been occupied since 2005 when Israelis expelled thousands of settlers and handed the keys over to Gazans.
Thank you , this was the point u was trying to put across, it's not just about the Israel Palestine conflict. It was about everything really and how quickly people take a firm stance in their ideas / opinions. It seems like open discussions are dissolving. I've seen people get verbally abused for being on the fence about subjects instead of being die hard for / against.
Not when they are muslims, apparently.

He confirmed that the Al Jazeera reporter's family were known fatalities resulting from an IDF strike and that when they don't know the specifics about the fatalities they wait for an announcement from Hamas.Not sure why you're bringing up "an accident". It was a deliberate IDF airstrike, no one is disputing that here. The IDF itself has officially confirmed that it did carry out an airstrike there.That is still not the same as claiming the airstrike was deliberately targeting the Al Jazeera reporter's family in particular though. Like I said, maybe it will come out that they were. But that isn't what is being claimed here. No games being played here dude, just sticking to the facts to not muddle things further in an already messy and tragic situation.
It's not porn. It's an 18+ Asian movie. Either Korean or Chinese. Trust me I know.
Glad you agree, thanks
Sure buddy.
May want to check your math, are you a girl? 2005 - 1967 does not equal 75 silly. Israel has not occupied Gaza since 2005. Blockade, along with Egypt, is not an occupation, words matter
I didn't lose shit. I'm just a human being against the killing of innocent people not cheering like most people in this idiotic sub.
Thought Hamas and PIJ rockets can't do any major damage, sure looks similar to hospital parking lot damage
Words like "genocide" mean things. You don't get to use that word when it's not happening and expect to be taken seriously.
It honestly looks more like a movie sex scene than porn

Well yeah my mistake. It's actually more like a Warsaw ghetto kind of thing.

There was a crib in that top floor feet from where the rocket entered

Ahh yes. The prison they are firing rockets from. I hate when my local correctional facility launches attacks on my home

You‚Äôve just described exactly why it is propaganda.
Oh I thought they meant non-IDF/Hamas stuff. Yeah. Well, humans have really been on a roll since 8,000 bce
I think that's the overall point of the comment. People are so convicted about things they are so ignorant of that they don't realize how ignorant they are and presume that their point of view is objectively true when they don't know shit.
Because of 75 years of being in an open air prison.
No amount of polishing is going to make that turd look good.
On god bruh, I really think we would've been much better without it. We would still fight for sure, but at least it would be between people of different mindsets rather than mindless followership.

It's currently active, and you can give golden upvotes to the comment. I think Reddit grossly overestimates how many people are willing to spend money on an individual upvote. When awards were part of being a premium member, they made sense to give out. Having people spend a minimum of $1.99 for a single monetized upvote, that has a pretty suspect distribution system, doesn't seem like it's going to have legs.
Whats funny to me is the video was halfway over and fullscreen, how did they get here in front of all these people?
Hamas, and it only hit the parking lot of the hospital.
Why is it that every time someone tries to sympathize with Israel the "oh but what about palestine" argument is thrown for some reason but it's never the other way around? Everyone got mad when Israel commit war crimes but celebrate it when they were the victims of it? It's so weird that people act like they are neutral, when they are clearly part of the propaganda and want to steer away the narrative themselves.Nobody asked the people in this video to tear the posters, they are doing it on their own, instead, if they care so much about Palestinians, then do something that could help them, tearing posters of missing people isn't saving Palestinians.
Palestine was a sovereign  state....wow didn't know that.
Hey, I just wanted to let you know that it was pretty cool of you to ask so others wouldn't have to.
Do they fly their choppers usually this low?
People have been asking them for years why they don't hit Hamas rockets sites. We see now that they have the planes, they have the bombs and can take care of them. We've seen multiple videos of rockets being fired from Gaza from above as a plane starts dropping bombs on them.They have aerial imagery of these rockets firing off. But they don't end up hitting the location. Not before this war at least. They could have been doing this for years. But they haven't. And it's not a matter of international optics. They've been dropping a ton of bombs in Gaza for years. Just not much on the missile launch sites.I will say it's at least nice to see the Israeli people figure this bullshit out after all these years of us watching it go down.
They're bombing idf tunnels
Maybe, and stick with me here, we humanize everyone. And, and, I know this is where it gets tricky, dehumanizing one side doesn‚Äôt humanize the other. So tearing down posters about kidnapped kids, hope I haven‚Äôt lost you yet, is a really shitty thing to do.

The Palestinians have been slipping quite a few of their peace and innocence rockets past Israel's air-defense the last couple of days.  Iron-Dome must not be 100% at the moment.
Idk there is not even nudity here. Honestly the video of the girl licking a gum wall was more indecent..
While we bomb the shit out of an entire population!Stand with humanity indeed.
Female IDF soldiers don't suffer nearly as many problems. They have them for crowd/protest control and limited combat roles yes. But when you look at some of the nastier sides of what the IDF has done it's always groups of guys. They don't bring women into it.Those dirty deeds are what is fucking these guys uphttps://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/video-i-killed-you-these-hands-israeli-soldier-tells-lawmakersThis former IDF soldier sums it up pretty well. His mother had to pay for his treatment after his fighting in gaza. Then the Israeli government sued her because she didn't pay it back fast enough.They are just a big bag of dicks
I don‚Äôt care who you support, there are victims on both sides, this is disgusting.
I agree. Nothing left to lose.
I just don‚Äôt buy at all they haven‚Äôt been targeting rocket launchers all these time to allow money to pile up, more likely optics of reply to relatively insignificant targets during time of relative peace aren‚Äôt worth the hassle, if what you claimIs even true at all(I doubt that part as well)
Uh don't lie. The tweet you linked reads: &gt; Channel 13 journalist Tzvi Yechezkeli, confirms that it was an IDF strike that killed the family of Al-Jazeera‚Äôs chief correspondent in Gaza, killing his wife, son, daughter &amp; others.  That is a journalist confirming that it was an IDF strike and that the victims include the family of the Al-Jazeera correspondent. That is not at all 'Israel confirming that they specifically targeted that journalist's family'. What happened is terrible. The IDF has those civilians' blood on their hands and what they are doing is going too far and wrong. But don't lie about what the tweet you linked said. Lying like you did here is what perpetuates misinformation and a cycle of prejudice and violence, and it helps no one except those who profit off that cycle continuing. If it does come out later that the IDF did deliberately target that journalist's family, then ofc that should be shared and spread so that people can be aware of what is truly happening. But the tweet you linked is not making that claim.
Clear evidence that China is supplying rockets to Hamas.They don't work long enough to explode once they reach the target.
Careful with that door!

Why do you think the Israelis are trying to get Netanyahu out of office? The most recent poll showed 86% in favor of him leaving.The Israelis have finally woken up and realized a few key points about this conflict- they live in a medium security prison praying that the maximum security prison doesn't open getting some of them killed- their leaders are more interested in staying in power and making money than they are solving the Palestinian issue or protecting Israelis- their leaders are lazy and ignorant and take warnings from other governments and intelligence agencies yet don't act on them. Resulting in Israeli deaths- their leaders have taken a generation of Israeli boys and turn them into thugs and strong arm guards resulting in a mental health crisis amongst IDF troops that's not being addressedSo I'm not victim blaming. I'm going after the abuser (Netanyahu) who is unwanted by the victims (Israelis)Catch up. There's a lot of news outside of this sub involving this conflict. It's best to stay up to date so you don't accuse people of silly things on social media due to a lack of knowledgeDownvote üëá
I assume you take a similar attitude to pro-palestinian protests in the West, then? Seeing as both are different methods of achieving the exact same objective?

Could that be a roof knock? I would leave if that happened to me.Or is it only Israel that roof knocks?
I mean‚Ä¶maybe we could stop bombing them, that might help too.

Google the median age for Palestine. Then let's talk about kidnapping.It's in poor taste to tear these posters down. It's in poor taste to pretend there aren't tenfold more missing Palestinians from the last few decades. This is propaganda that gets us to humanize and empathize with one group and ignore/not learn more about the devastating plight of another.

I understand your point about awareness but would you consider the fact that this news has essentially been covered from every single international journalistic enterprise from every single angle?? Awareness is, I would argue, not an issue. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, what Hamas did was horrific and wrong. Terroristic organisations do not have a place in a peaceful world and therefore they should be condemned and yes I do condemn them to their core. That being said ‚ÄúMissing Persons‚Äù posters are placed in the area where they went missing to generate leads to find them, these posters do not generate anything of the sort and are purely placed there to garner sympathy and although I do sympathise with the people who have been kidnapped and their loved ones these posters also ignite negative emotions or apathy towards Palestine and Palestinians, which in turn would make it seem that Israel‚Äôs actions in Gaza are somehow appropriate response or justified. Think about it this way if you were a loved one of someone who has been a victim of a political kidnapping would you give a rats ass about a poster in London or would you be more concerned about bringing them back? This is essentially propaganda and ‚Äúpropaganda‚Äù isn‚Äôt an umbrella term used for any reasoning or evidence for political situations, it is intentional use or misuse of unrelated rhetoric to promote a government agenda for example if a government wants to explain poor economic performance they can select a specific group within the population to villainies and blame even though that has nothing to do with economics the tools used to accomplish that would be called propaganda. I feels like you‚Äôre saying that apathy towards the conflict is the correct way to look at it and I disagree my sympathy will always be with the ones that are innocent and are suffering namely the Israeli people and the Palestinian people all other entities calling for war and violence can go fuck themselves.
My dude where do you get your world view, snapple bottle tops?
I feel like at this point some of the civilians are just kinda jaded to this. Especially since it didn't blow up (at least not yet). Its just kind of a pleasant suprise.

&gt;Except they‚Äôve traded hundreds of Palestinian prisoners for a few Israelis in the past. And look how well that turned out. They definetly stopped Kidnappings. You know, they didn't felt encouraged to cause even more hostage situations, right? Those released Palestinians went into retirement and didn't conspire to harm Israel; only pacifists were released, right?You want to argue that taking civilian hostages is a legit strategy?&gt;You wouldn‚Äôt even wanna see what they have to say after 200 hostages? No need to ask what Hamas has to say. Pretty obvious what they want. And that's rightfully unacceptable for Israel unless one desires a repetition of the October 7 attacks.

I'm gonna wait on more details than reddit, I already see tons of people have decided the whole story ahead of this, even before looking further into it. It's quite shocking how easy it is. You can post a video on twitter that is so short and perhaps not even translated correctly (Idk) with someone saying his take on it, and that's all that is necessary. Is it possible they "targeted" a family, bien sur. Is it absolutely true? Who knows. I don't assume or trust reddit much more than twitter, esp bc reddit gets all their news from twitter or worse, TikTok and youtube. I give up on getting to know the truth on here, sadly.

Ahh no worries he closed the door, all good.

Every four days? I know of a journalist, a cameraman, and this family, I'm sure there are others but every four days sounds iffy. Do you have a source for this? However I agree that people forget just how dangerous being a journalist can be, if you are covering wars or people with secrets to hide. I loosely keep track of journalists who have been killed here in America or abroad, it's still always a shock. There are plenty of non famous journalists who don't get publicity in America, whose deaths are suspicious as well. But one every four days sounds extreme unless you are covering war or the mob.
6-7 hours the IDF will prob post something. Maybe more clips will come out from Gaza till then.

I had written a moment ago that I didn‚Äôt understand why anyone would do this. It hadn‚Äôt occurred to me (clearly) why someone might do this. Your explanation was helpful. Thank you.
They always do this on reddit and on twitter, you have to filter through the noise to get closer to the truth. Targeted is used often when it should not be. I've even seen purposely false translations or fake subtitles added in the past week, one to a NK dictator's speech, another to a song sung by Israeli soldiers, purposely done to drive rage and reactions and engagement. When people do this, they don't realize they are also pushing away those who would normally be supportive. If you have to lie or embellish for your message, be sure that there will be some people who notice this over time. It then makes me doubt the entire narrative, sometimes.
Hell no. The Woodward group will never let that thing run low.They got loans and investments in the IDF, a "charity" wing that makes political contributions to netanyahu's party from the top down, repair contracts for some of Israel's hardware etcThe more Israel uses the Iron Dome the more money Woodward makes replenishing them. Which means more they can invest in Netanyahu and his military.Letting Hamas fire off rockets and letting the Iron Dome shoot them out of the sky has put money in pockets. Yeah they could have been targeting Hamas rocket sites to protect Israelis all these years. But that's not good for business.
when do we get clips from these night time raids ?
I don‚Äôt support Israel. I feel for the Palestinians. I don‚Äôt understand what doing something like tearing down these posters is supposed to accomplish. It just seems hateful and purposeless.
UN has been keeping track of war crimes committed, this will be noted if Bibi and the IDF ever face actual prosecution. Don't be hopeless, although it's hard.
Gentlemen, there is no fighting in the war subreddit!
Disgusting, heartless people.
I mean, who hasn't been in that situation?
Did that even last a month?
I think it's easy for us to say that these acts are uncalled for because we have not gone through what palestines have gone through their blatant injustices and it's honestly okay to think like that. They saw the world never cared when their kids and families were getting humiliated, treated like dogs and killed every day for years, no one batted an eye then, but when the same thing happened to the oppresor everyone came in to support them. Instead of empathasising, they were being called terrorists, when their homes were destroyed, when their kids were being traumatised, killed. So why should they care for anybody else, when their fate is sealed. Most people here cannot comprehend what that feels like because they just did not live through it, so it's easy to sit on their confortable couches and critisize these actions.
yeah well Twitter has posted enough fake news since Elon ramped up the lies and the paid bots, so is there another source? It's crazy what they are doing on that site now, you can't trust anything, just about.
I was in London recently and noticed people tearing these down.Civilians are always the losers in war, regardless of which "side" they are on.

So shiny, so Chrome! Witness me!"
My question was kind of rhetorical, but yes, I think hate is a big part of it. I also think it‚Äôs following the herd‚Äîif you hold certain beliefs you need to follow others who hold those same beliefs. In some cases, I think it‚Äôs people trying to give themselves a sense of purpose or action. For me, tearing down these posters shows a callous disregard for innocent people‚Äôs existences, dehumanizing those stuck in the middle of an unconscionably awful situation. (This by no means excuses Israel‚Äôs own dehumanizing actions against Palestinians over many decades.)

The reason they gave was that some consumer study (with what we can only assume we're lowest common denominator soccer moms, preteens, and boomers) thought that the award system was too confusing and had too many options. So instead of going back to the prior simple Reddit Gold system it had for a decade they just took everything away while they think of how to finish polishing up their updoots-for-cash monetization.
Very sad

Netanyahu made Ayelet Shaked the Minister of Justice after her appallingly racist, vitriolic rant. Internally, Israel has a problem. To assume otherwise is blind willfulness or the sign of a much deeper problem.

Very graphic.
Because he's a reporter, not Israel. And because if you listen to his words, he's guessing that the family is the target by waiting for Hamas to announce who died. Like did you even watch it?
Lmao, It's funny when you put it like that, I wonder what his logic was, because being honest if a rocket or an Unexploded bomb went through my building &amp; I was still alive, I would run a good distance.but on the other hand him thinking differently as a first in humanity has been able to document what an unexploded rocket looks like from the top to the bottom and the whole room full of smoke/dust.To an untrained eye, everyday person most of us would be like of course something is wrongI do wonder though say If a Firefighter was already responding to a building fire, and they were going room to room, and somehow never heard the rocket Impact/devastate the building as they were in it,  If they would be able to tell anything was off about the way the smoke was behaving from that new room compared to a normal house fire?just wondering.
r\killthecameraman
Let‚Äôs go get right next to unexploded ordnance‚Ä¶ very smart.
I don‚Äôt agree with what they‚Äôre doing but this is their motivation. They‚Äôre mad that Palestinians imprisoned without trial don‚Äôt get this kind of attention and view it as a distraction from the injustices carried out by the Israeli government. I still think what they‚Äôre doing is nasty and uncalled for, in no small part because it helps to spread the narrative that the people who are critical of Israel‚Äôs government are that way because of antisemitism
Yeah but not when there is fire around unexploded munition. Here in Germany we have large forests where the firefighters don't enter in case of forest fire because of the 'pretty safe' military hobby in our countries past.
Sorry, it‚Äôs hard to tell with the current climate lol.
Yes... its what the bbc quoted on that hospital bombing.
You‚Äôre kidding right?
And that was just after they whined about al jazeera coverage and asking them to tone it downThis is obviously intended
Considering the amount of disbelief and antisemitic lies, I'm not surprised he wanted more evidence.

We‚Äôre talking about hamas rockets, they won‚Äôt have the same safety features as western rockets.
These people believe one of these rockets can cause a blast as big as was at the hospital. You're not going to convince them of anything you have to say based on technical knowledge or expertise. They're just here to watch stuff get blown up. The hows and whys don't matter.

Absolutely zero urgency which is so funny
You would be surprised the amount of people that disagree with you, it sucks
Let's be real, Google is as bad as Bing nowadays
Evidently not
It‚Äôs incredible how misinformed people are. Isreal was already there for 3000 years but they were pushed out and after ww2 when they were granted their land back for a Jewish state the Palestinians had to move. The Jews had their land taken and it took a genocide of their people to get it back. Isreal is around 3000 years old. Palestine is around 2000 years old.
Sure. Nothing stopping them from doing that instead of tearing down posters. But they're pro-Hamas, so they don't give a shit
Yeah man, I'm ex combat engineer. It's so easy they teach even infantry officers to do it alone.
Yeah but thinking just a little bit further would lead you to the "now we ain't got no driver, going 100+ down the street" scenario. These kids didn't plan on dying so dude gave them a fear factor.

Lmao
The US Mark 14 torpedoes had‚Ä¶issues. Their detonators weren‚Äôt worth a pile of poo and they ran about ten feet deeper than set.
Lmao wtf is that going to do when 50 tons of concrete fall on you
Sick fucks
Anti fraud lecture in China??? Oh the irony.
The irony here is that we just need to look towards Reddit moderators for examples of Palestinian suffering being removed, locked and censored from view.
I think everyone can agree that civilian victims sucks. No matter what their nationalities are.
Probably wouldn‚Äôt stay there
It can't catch everything. Some rockets do get thru.
Bro had to give us the proof like the hole in the patio wasn't enough man went to show us the house on fire lmao
My insurance company: looks like storm damage, act of god, not covered.Me: there‚Äôs a friggin missile burning in the master bedroom!Insurance: well sure, the storm blew it there
That's one of my worst nightmares when presenting to an audience

This reality is sad as shit!
How many Palestinians did Hamas kidnap and torture? Oh, right, none.
Idk but i want out now
This feels wrong but I also don‚Äôt know why they put those posters up in London either
What‚Äôs the point of tearing down the posters?
Also could have been POINTY fragment after interception. Anyway, lucky guy, that would be like $50.000 in repairs in Israel. Shit's expensive.
no cops around? How many littering tickets should that idiot have gotten?
Excuse me everyone SEEEEEEEEXXXXxx!! Now that I have your attention.
This is absolutely wrong.Stand with humanity.
They found a new, more lucrative, way to monetize which has yet to be implemented, afaik.
.....I have never heard a worse take on this.
He‚Äôs from Gaza bro. He lives there. His family is from there. And he‚Äôs not able to leave the Gaza Strip either.
Why would the innocent Palestinians do this?
They are making videos of the traumatized children and mothers but for some reason that isn‚Äôt considered propaganda. It should all be shown on each side, however they want to release it.
He also says that the rocket penetrated the roof into the apartment and that there's an active fire. then when he opens the door he says "that's the fire, I'm closing the door now".  madlad
I would like to imagine I would not hurt civilians who agreed with the bombing, but I would certainly no longer be a pacifist.
ALL OF US GONNA DIE THEM
Cause many of those prisoners are citizens of thst cuntry also to remind people why the ear is happening.
[its illegal to boycott israel in several us states](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti-BDS_laws#:~:text=Proliferation%20of%20anti%2DBDS%20laws,passed%20with%20broad%20bipartisan%20support.)
That is absolutely hilarious. I don't know what a "fuck saw" is, but I think it just makes the story even funnier.
Godlike explanation, sir/ma'am/fapper.
I'm enjoying the comments by all  reddit's geopolitical experts telling us what Israel is doing or not doing in  secrecy.
This is like something that happens at the end of a raunchy romantic early 2000‚Äôs movie.
I'm so tired of people thinking they know enough about so many subjects that they do stupid shit like this. Ukraine, Israel / Palestine, COVID, UFOs, everyone's a bloody expert these days.
How much time do you dipshits spend coming up with this drivel? An hero. Look into it.
They‚Äôre called Anti-BDS laws.‚ÄúTo date, 37 states have adopted laws, executive orders, or resolutions designed to discourage boycotts against Israel.‚Äùhttps://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/anti-bds-legislation
Good thing he shut that door
Maybe put up kidnapped Palestinians next to them, then what?
Do you think they call it "Asian porn" over there, or is it just "porn"?
Ohhhh, that's embarrassing!But uh...what did you think?
These people in the video are pro-Hamas. Call it what it is.
It‚Äôs not a surprise. Israel has been assassinating journalists for years. Most people don‚Äôt want to believe that as Israel cannot do anything wrong.
This can blow up and kill everyone near it.This guy: I‚Äôm gonna run and check the rocket with my own eyes.
I remember getting a reminder for every project in my highschool US Gov class that the website was in fact whitehouse.gov lol
Citation please..
He's right handed
I promise you, I am not the person who would know the answer to that question.
Little do you that know that Bing is the ONLY tool for that job.
Can‚Äôt cite for countries in Europe but in multiple US states when performing work as a state contractor you are required to sign an agreement that you will not protest against the Israeli government.  Mostly red states because freedom is contradictory.
Nailed it.
Who tf investigates unexploded ordinance in their immediate vicinity? It's that rockets house now fuck that üòÇ
2 black dudes look similar = the joke
Isn't that the Korean Canadian lady who was like a radio celebrity who appeared in a movie and actually did unsimulated sex acts, but wasn't actually a pornstar (because she was like a radio celebrity or something, pay attention), but did get fucked on camera anyway?
Thank god Hamas has flinstone level weapon manufacturing. judging by the multiple strollers and the crib in this house I‚Äôm assuming this man is a father with young children.
Looks pretty decent to me
‚ÄúUmmmm No this looks like an Israeli occupier air strike where they killed 60000 Palestinians‚Äù - terrorist apologist
Iron Dome running low?
fucking hellwhat cursed timeline is this
I mean it‚Äôs propaganda at the end of the day. It‚Äôs spinning a narrative. They‚Äôre not going to find them in London. Israel isn‚Äôt even negotiating for their return.Edit: I do agree it‚Äôs in poor taste but to some people seeing blatant propaganda must be triggering.
Why did reddit get rid of them anyway? It was income to them I thought with that whole you paid for x hours of server time thing they had on your profile.
"It's propaganda when I disagree with it."
Why are people denying what the reporter said in the link? ‚Äúusually we know the target, for example today the target was the family of an Al Jazeera journalist‚Äù
I don't think the Israeli's comprehend the absolute cluster they are unleashing on themselves by the way they are going to radicalize normal citizenry into joining radical groups, or maybe they do and they don't care.I am just saying. If that is my wife and kids, I am joining the nearest paramilitary group. No downside, best case scenario I end up with my family again.
And it was his home video.
Are they supposed to find them?
You can at least buy him dinner first.
Jeff Winger???
someone's getting fucked and it's not the porn lady
I'm no fan of the Israeli (governments)'s handling of the situation, but to tear down poster of innocent Israeli's caught in the crossfire is fucked.
What in the softcore fraud is this?
Sooo, even Asians like Asian porn. Whoda thunk it?
Those sounds are the collective murmur of worry of hundreds of social credit scores dropping through the floor.
I'd put money on Israel doing this on purpose.I wouldn't put money on Israel celebrating this because I know no one would take that bet. We all know.
Can you cite the ban and by which government?
No it wouldn't lol. It's amazing how regarded most of Reddit is. Suddenly everyone is a conflict and middle east expert.
That's a paddlin'
It‚Äôs actually not banned, it‚Äôs a good question why pro Palestinian people aren‚Äôt making their own postersInteresting
Why do we have any protests at all in the US about a war in a different country?Any argument for protesting for a foreign issue applies to these posters, propaganda or not
&gt;The secret is that the leadership in Israel knows that they are creating new fighters against them but that is the only way how asswipe-Netanjahu can keep his power. It is very much like Putlers playBenji has to win fair elections to use these tactics though. It's part of what Israelis have continued to vote for, even if they have moved away from Benji it's generally further right (Gantz for instance). Russians lost that choice a while ago
And now kick them out. All of them
CCP always was in the chatmade the chat, made the software and the device
Math teacher at my kids‚Äô Catholic high school recently left Chaturbate open on his laptop while  projecting. Fired a few days later.
I'm still waiting for the freakout, was the video cut short?
Me neither! I was thinking news article!
I had a co-worker for years who LOVED Bing. Whenever we see each other we still make fun of her for it.
üèÖ
This is less embarrassing
Is it banned?
I know this porno‚Ä¶and I start to realize that‚Äôs maybe I spent too much time in pornsites
I noticed that, since your pencil is already so short.
Man saw Jamie Fox in Collateral when Tom Cruise put a gun to his head and said ‚ÄúImma do that‚Äù.
Seriously, is this the first ever instance of "binging" seen in the wild? Did Satya Nadella ever teach in China?
Now you know where Hamas came from.
No he means like "binge", as in "he was *binge*-watching porn in front of his students and suddenly noticed when the post-nut clarity kicked in"
He coulda stayed in the car, back up &amp; have their flattened bodies waiting for the coroner.
Social credit goes weeeeeeeeeeeeee
Yeah he‚Äôll rock their shit they‚Äôre too damn scared to use the gun

It's propaganda and likely without the families concent.
Social cc down to -‚ôæÔ∏è
FuckDude that‚Äôs to funny.  I‚Äôm being real.I messed myself laughing to hard at ya comment.
He managed to not hurt people on the streets ?
Why it‚Äôs banned to do the same for Palestinians who are dead or missing by IDF?
Lol, you lucked out BIG there. Pretty solid for them to not peep over such an accident.
Okay putting up posters of kidnapped people in another country is stupid and pointless. Let‚Äôs be real what the posters really want to do is garner sympathy for Israel and to justify Israel‚Äôs barbaric actions in Gaza to the world. It‚Äôs disgusting to use the tragedy of  the kidnapped to promote your own misdoings, it‚Äôs down right despicable. The posters are nothing more than propaganda. I absolutely sympathise with the people who are kidnapped and their families but these posters are not about them.
But only straight people, everyone else is free to go
Worse yet referring to it as "Binging"
**SEX!!!**Now that I have your attention.
Holy shit mate alright I wasn't expecting _that_ source

"Today were here to make sure you don't get screwed."
Hey I have that same wallpaper
I'm thinking the lecturer's social score is going to be adjusted.
To demonstrate support for a cause by putting a human face to it. It's no real different than taking out an advert to show support or flying a flag or rallying.  I find it more interesting people feel the need to take them down. Unless it's your property and you don't want these flyers up,  it seems petty to take them down.  Especially if they are up with the consent of the property owner. People just have too much time on their hands .
So it was your lecture.
They probably think the driver is 'serial killer' level unbalanced by this point.  As soon as they bailed, I can see them trying to set track records.
Why tf does this have 92 upvotes when the tweet does not appear to support the claim? Help me understand...
The best part is when every single person gets out of the van while it's still moving to get away from each other and now they're all together and a van is now rolling down the street with no occupants.
There's a special place in hell for these people. Looks like the average age is like 20 years old, too. Young morons.
Yea. Isreal needs to stop and it's leaders face punishment for the war crimes it's committing. These people also need to be stopped and shown that two wrongs do not make a right. It's pathetic
lol wtf
Na, kids were 16ish and got on well with them so they kept quiet and no other staff saw. Got quite lucky

perhaps the arab nations should help thier muslim brothers before they are bombed to oblivion along with the terrorists that hide amoungst them.

Dude will 100% lose his job because it was on video but the kids would probably be cool about it if it wasn't. When teaching in China I showed them Romeo + Juliet but misremembered Claire Danes' (angelic actress) name as Claire Dames (butterface pornstar) and made the horrific mistake of Binging it while it was on the projector.
Yes, I tend to agree. Folks may be loathe to admit it, but most nations would respond similarly to such an assault against their citizens. Of course, elements of this conflict are unique (a conflict of inherently, vastly unequal sides), but the side of human nature that would inevitably call for blood was never likely to be silenced. The cost is great, in lives, radicalized people, public/international relations, humanity, ethics, morality... perhaps far too great. And increasing every hour as collateral damage mounts.
Its certainly anti-fraud she wasn‚Äôt faking it.
This happened to my 8th grade teacher as well, although, it was VHS so even harder to do ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù IMO

Those interested in reading a Kate pilot's autobiography should search for 'The Miraculous Torpedo Squadron'.
lol if this is true, I feel sorry for the lecturer. Just imagine all the charges. Public indecency, disruption of societal order etc. This would not only make him/her fired, but also banned on media platforms, fined and perhaps jailtime since he/she could have also angered chinese parents from CCP.

Those pesky Jews never should have attacked Germany and killed a bunch of innocent people first. Oh wait that never happened. üòÇ
This is nothing more than an Islamist crusade. Jews and Muslims lived together in peace in Spain and Portugal. So much so that in 1492, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire sent his Navy to bring them both back to the holy land. Sultan Bayezid made them citizens and threatened the Jews mistreatment with death. The British and the French lit this fuse. So, from 1492 until 1917, there were no major problems, but once the English Empire crumbled, so did the mideast. The immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries had been looked upon through a different lens. We can go farther back, but 1492 is significant in many ways. War and conquest are a very unfortunate part of the human condition. Watch a good documentary on the Ottomans. We humans sometimes do not make good people. Fun fact the Pax Romana 1000 "mostly peaceful" years no major war, but Judaism was in direct conflict with the Roman religion system of tolerance, but only if you had to pay monetary homage Think Jesus and the tax collectors. 2 revolts, and they had enough. 1492 I hope for a Pax Romana but without the overseers. For Hamas, Hezbollah, and Iran, it's a war for the Holy land first, then the rest of us. Peace for all humanity. I just want to be left alone.
Sauce?
Sauce??
The date in OP's title implies it happened in January of this year. It was a typo.
they really didn't plan for such an eventuality though, i mean i don't see how they *could* have held even a single village beyond the walls but i also don't see the whole operation as having been planned with any expectation of achieving *strategic* goals.  I think anyone trying to hold ground just thought they had a chance from the initial chaos, but even getting hostages felt like a "stretch goal" to me.
[Love how people want to ignore the Palestinian president.](https://apnews.com/article/palestinians-israel-holocaust-abbas-antisemitism-1d84b3a82f0d8ff3fd8601f06bc1176e)[And Palestinian politicians.](https://apnews.com/article/palestinians-holcocaust-abbas-israel-controversy-antisemitism-jewish-3bc304b40e5aa7213b61e68f23271381)You know who else were antisemitic and came up with rationales for the Holocaust? That‚Äôs right - Nazis.
Given the meanings of that word, it's way too ambiguous for this news story.  For example "Bob had his neighbor killed by a hitman".This gentleman was a journalist - he would agree. A diverse audience are reading these reports.  Some are new to the issue and trying to learn what's going on from the other side of the world with different problems sharing the news cycle and competing for their attention.
Everyone in the north has been told to move south, closer to humanitarian aid, everyone in the north of Gaza knows they are at extreme risk of being killed, staying put is absolute lunacy, they are asking to be killed at this point.. and saying "this is our home we wont leave" is not a valid excuse to stay.
Then what the actual fuck did they look out for?
From the looks of it, it seems that it was actually pretty well orchestrated, and they moved around and met in tunnels to coordinate the attack.   OFC, Israel still dropped the ball PRETTY FUCKING HARD on this, but it seems that Hamas actually knew how to elude some of Israel's surveillance systems.

believe it or not straight to jail
This is kind of insulting to the IDF lol. They are just kickin their feet up having matzah ball soup I guess.

Shh...we don't want to rile anyone up that a bombing to kill one guy leveled three buildings. I'm sure all 3 of those large residential buildings were filled with extremists and not innocent civilians!
How do you think they know he‚Äôs there? Satellite tracking, surveillance, local assets or the good old fashioned call up the target‚Äôs landline and when he answers the phone pull the trigger. Sure they can get it wrong, they have gotten wrong in the past, and they will get it wrong in the future. The Geneva Convention clearly states that the simple presence of civilians is not enough justification to deter attacking valid military targets. When Hamas sets up shop in a building they invite attack upon everyone else in the building.
This is truly disgusting and disheartening
Sooooo we're just taking their word for it is the answer.
make it 326 are children
People have been told to move south, away from the north, closer to humanitarian aid... at this point staying in Gaza is just complete lunacy, almost asking to be killed..
I mean that Isreal has no chance to win this war. The way they do it, it takes hundreds of civilians to get to one Hamas member. They have limited time until international pressure will force them into a truce. If they won't break Hamas until that time , they lose. So I'm expecting more aggressive strikes with a lot of collateral.
That strike for a single person is surely causing some collateral damage. Unfortunate for all the innocent people trapped in a warzone with no way out.
And the debacle of 1973.
*Total precision strike on a large neighborhood resulting in the singular destruction of the deputy head of intel of hamas and no one else, allegedly.
Because Israel will continue to kill innocent civilians buy the boat load to get at the few Hamas commanders.Most of the participants of the actual attack are dead anyway. Something like 1,500 of them.
One of the best intelligence agencies in the world (except for the debacle of missing the Hamas attack), loads of drones and surveilance. Also, it kind of sucks, but innocent people living in the same house as Hamas headquarters are fucked. The IDF mostly does roof-knocking, calls the people living in the house, sends flyers, stuff like that, but in a case like that where they aimed to liquidate 1 person it would be contraproductive to warn them, so I'm not sure what happens in that case.
we ask them nicely
^CCP ^ENTERS ^THE ^CHAT
no..*had* their family killed *by israeli airstrikes*
Prior to October 7th Israel wasn't looking out for terrorist attack from its bordering region known for committing terrorist attacks???
You could, and that would be fair. But you'd lose out on some of the good talks we could have about the whole of humanity. Which is suffering right now, with all of the bad stuff going on here on our planet.

Exactly. They don't allow footage from the Palestinian side and remove them as "Not combat footage" but not this. Guess who has an agenda?
oh yeah ofc it is. it was the jews fault 6 million of them were killed because they didn‚Äôt surrender.
I'm not saying this through a political lens.   When you say someone *had* their family killed... it can mean they had something to do with it.   This is not intentional, but it's very disrespectful towards him. It's the opposite of what happened.For an important story like this, what you"re communicating in the headline matters.
Sorry, why is it grim exactly? I might not understand
Yeah that‚Äôs the point. How does IDF know he‚Äôs there? What about every other innocent person there?
I'd hate to see that guy when he IS scared.
Out of those 320 are children
I'm just glad there are still subs not overrun by useful idiots supporting Hamas, while trying to act like they aren't supporting Hamas.
I know where my neighbors live and where they go to work. I have no idea what they doing at home.
People say not to trust the casualty figures coming out of Gaza. Why should we trust these headlines coming from IDF. How many babies and innocent civilians were liquidated as well? I‚Äôm sure that Hamas guy was hanging out above ground in a big empty building.
Plenty of tunnels
Curious why this sub doesn't allow videos of Palestinians being bombed ever since the creation of this sub as "not combat footage" but does allow Israelis being hit by rockets after the recent escalation.
Are your parents from the same "willage"?
Yeah, bunkers aren't perfect and you can still die in them, but they're a hell of a lot better then nothing.
They attack Israel and they will be put in their place!
Turning that area into the worlds largest parking lot
Listen to the popular front episode on this
This past few days a lot of my fellow citizens made fun of a tv war live news reporter for dodging besides a car while live feeding whilst israel citizens calmly rode bikes on the pavement next to her. A longer cut video emerged in which we could hear IDF alarm sirens for rocket attacks. She was doing what IDF informed citizens and news reporters to do in case of airstrike attack. Probably those bicycle riding citizens where so used to attack alarms they just chose to ignore that specific one.
It is often hard to see that which you are not looking for.
That kind of detail makes me wonder if it still could have been towed for repairs. Or were they worried it would even again come under attack?
Why is it impossible to find a place that has balanced nuanced takes and discussion on this matter? I suppose that‚Äôs the human condition tho  ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Are you sure it isn't a Sex Education class?
They honestly won't know immediately but Israeli intelligence will be monitoring comms between members and will pick up on chatter regarding damage done, who's missing/dead and whos now in charge.It's a bit more reliable than the "Gaza ministry of health" but
At least you won't be bored when you're hiding in your shelters
Oaths have been broken.  Many.
Electronic intelligence.  You can be certain that Israel has hundreds, maybe thousands, of phones and network connections under surveillance at all times.  They know where these guys are because they've been watching them for years.

This is the fucking Warsaw ghetto with 2 million people. No one leaves. No place to hide from the bombs. No food, no water, no electricity. So? What would you do with your children?
This is not a combat footage, it's an attack against unarmed civilians by armed cowards. Infringes **Rule 4**.
What would you do?   Do nothing because terrorists hide amongst civilians?And if you do nothing it is a matter of time before Hamas kills Irsaeli civilians.

Everything we is "*according to IDF".When anyone from Hams gets killed nobody is hiding it. On the contrary, they gain another martyr.I have seen a video by a respected analyst who claimed that so far IDF has killed about 50-70 "serious" hamas members. And thousands of Palestinians.Taking into account that Hamas has about 5000 members in Gaza it paint a grin picture.
Pure genocide ü•≤

Yes, but dead Arabs kids. Those don't count to the israeli forces.
OP and everyone posting bombings on buildings putting a name next to it... If you don't add a source you can just skip posting. How the fuck do I know who is in there, it looks like every other bombing attached with a name it might as well say "Liquidation of Mickey Mouse" and it has as much credence
That's fair. Do rockets and bombs not really start fires though? I would imagine the possibility is always there.
Better than Hamas intelligence "kill all the Jews"
"Precision bombing""Minimalizing collateral damages""We don't give a fuck how many civilians died in the strike"
After the initial explosion, there‚Äôs something that appears to be shooting out and detonating mid air, if you watch in the far left/ lower area of the screen.
Hamas is actually an ancient race of buildings.
People have not been able to leave gaza....
‚ÄòI‚Äôm just taking the dog out for a piss‚ÄôBoom
If you don't wanna get burned don't play with fire.  This is on Hamas if they want to wage war against Israel then do so meet them on a battlefield like men.  Instead they fire rockets right outside Palestinian homes placing them in danger.  Israel defends itself and returns fire.  Is this the outcome that any sane person wants? OF COURSE NOT. This is what Hamas has chosen your argument is with them. DON'T WANT NONE , DON'T START NONE.
&gt; both sides are still bad I should implement a filter in my browser that immediately hides anyone using this *insane* line of thinking after October 7.
Why do you think anyone left there?It's been 19 days since the start of the war. you would've expected them to evacuate, or else Hamas is forcing them to stay, which who's to blame for that? If I know there's a target on my back, or in that case, a 1-ton JDAM guided bomb, I wouldn't keep children around me.

Please post more things like this it would be greatly apricated. I am bieing forced to take a break from posting so you will see more of me in the comments. People need to see the human cost of atrocities against the Palestinians because at the end of the day all they are doing is radicalizing the survivors which will commit more attacks killing more Israeli civilians creating a vicious cycle of justification for the genocide of the Palestinian people. Remember there are no victors in war only victims.
I think they got 'im
And against all those sacrifices made, today, we have members of the GOP attempting to subvert our Constitution.Sad times..
Not many people can survive having a building collapse on top of them after a missile strike.
Until they surrender its Hamas fault. ü§∑ Redditors really don‚Äôt understand the concept of war.
Exactly, the above comment says it was intentional targeting.
If Israel hadn't brutalized and abused Palestinians for the past almost century, they probably wouldn't have to worry about Hamas, but hey...here we are. Hamas is an Israeli creation. They are bad for Palestine, they will continue to be bad for Palestine and Isreal as well, because what's happening right now isn't going to change anything, in fact it's going to make everything, much, much worse.
Their intelligence was ‚ÄòHe‚Äôs somewhere over there‚Äô.
That's the Essex class Hornet, CV-12The one in the Video is the Yorktown class Hornet, CV-8
Cuz Hamas spent Ll the money the world.gave them instead of feed and support their people
From IDF TG:Joint IDF and ISA announcement:  The IDF and ISA killed the Deputy Head of Hamas‚Äô Intelligence Directorate, who was responsible for planning the October 7th massacre together with Yahya Sinwar  Based on precise IDF and ISA intelligence, IDF fighter jets struck the Deputy Head of the Hamas‚Äô Intelligence Directorate, Shadi Barud.  In his previous role as the Head of the Fire Control Center in Hamas' Operations Unit, Barud planned the barbaric October 7th attacks together with Yahya Sinwar. Barud had previously served as Hamas' battalion commander in Khan Yunis and was responsible for planning numerous terror attacks against Israeli civilians.  Following this, Barud held several positions in Hamas' military intelligence, and was responsible for information security. Until today, he was responsible for intelligence relations for Hamas.
I wonder what the driver was thinking when he got off and realized the muggers also got off at the same time.
It's ridiculous you are getting downvoted for this. these are huge, multifamily apartment buildings in a densely populated area. They literally took out two large buildings full of people to kill one guy.in the last election, about half of Gaza voted against Hamas, currently, 40% of Gaza is under 15. These are the people getting slaughtered now.This is wrong, and more to the point will make Israel less safe. People are downvoting you because you're ruining their childish revenge fantasy.These attacks will make Hamas stronger, and Israel less safe.
they are useless child human shields no one cares them anymore /s
how does the IDF know exactly that they got the guy or whether the guy was even there? We keep getting headlines of x senior commander being killed but it's not like they are out there checking the rubble.
Agreed, but it doesn‚Äôt say the strike was unintentional either.
Calm down, Gaza Health Ministry.
But a redditor just told me that Hamas has ancient rockets that can't be aimed so it can't be that bad.. /s
this is the correct answer.
Cry me an extremist river !! They knew the retaliation would be epically horrendous for them right? Right?
&gt;Firstly where would they get 2.2M Where do they get 2.2M clothes to wear?&gt;Second wtf is a helmet going to do when a concrete building is collapsing on them?I'm talking about prevention and reducing damage/risks.
Palestine doesn't build bunkers for civilians.  All their resources go towards terrorizing Israel.  Concrete and other building material goes to building terror tunnels.  Water pipes are dug up and repurposed into rockets.  Every dollar of humanitarian aid that isn't siphoned off by the Hamas fat cats in Qatar goes towards weapons and resources to support Hamas.
There‚Äôs something off about this being ‚Äúcombat‚Äù. More like war crimes tbh
You didn't watch TENET bro? They just used super secret time wrap weapon. Had to be done.
Like find another hobby‚Ä¶ losers
having been, I can tell you even I had a ton of misconceptions about Israel, I don't think people who haven't been from the US can understand it at all. Its just so different.
What was that first strike? Thermobaric ? Or was that just the shockwave collapsing ?
loool what a dumb thing to say. israeli bombs but hamas doing .
you convey the wrong meaning
And you can go to Alameda in CA and see her still chilling out in the dock

by digging a shelter, put some concrete over the top, and rely on functioning air defenses to dissuade anyone from lobbing one in the first place.
You spelled 10 wrong.
Crazy how all those random people are just photographing/recording the remains. At least that's what I think it is that they're all staring at.
Is this a serious question? Firstly where would they get 2.2M helmets? Second wtf is a helmet going to do when a concrete building is collapsing on them? Do you have a helmet that would save you from that?
Fair point
I saw a video of a hamas dude break into someone‚Äôs house , beat the guy to death and then tried decapitating the guy with a garden hoe.
please fix that headline
Depends on the country. In Hungary we use yyyy/mm/dd
I'm genuinely surprised how many people in this sub are aggressively antagonistic to any kind of acknowledgement of moral ambiguity on Israel's part or the fact that basically all we know is what the IDF chooses to show or tellI legitimately think a big reason for that is that it kind of kills the boners they have to watch Israel kick the teeth in of an inferior force with its shiny new weapons if we start having to think about this as anything but completely morally unambiguous
So the thing is already listing and it takes 369 more 5 inch shells and ‚Äúcountless‚Äù torpedos plus another 12 hours or something to sink. That‚Äôs insane .
Of their house??? I had always assumed that Israel did this on purpose to silence others, but part of me had at least hoped there was a chance this wasn‚Äôt true. I had hoped it was part of some larger structure so there would a sliver of possibility they were targeting something else. Fucking shameful Israel.
For over a decade now, the Russians and Chinese have been going on social media and pretending to be Americans with crazy viewpoints, normalizing these viewpoints and both sides eat it up.
I don‚Äôt get why he left. I assumed the haphazard driving was to scare them shitless and have them bail the moment he slowed down enough to leave but then the dude also fucks off out of the car. So now he‚Äôs back to standing next to the people who were threatening him. What was his plan exactly?
Some fellas say he didn't see it because it was planned by budanov (joke lol)
They could.
I don‚Äôt know, the whole live streaming the murder of Israeli children still seems like a bad move.  I know, 20/20 hindsight and all, but still it‚Äôs a bad move putting gopros on your terrorists during the terrorism.
Hamas should really just surrender already. This is their doing.
Yup, hamas put all of their infastructure among civilians, thinking the israelis would care. And they did, because the rest of the world cared. Now theyre hurt, and they dont care anymore.
Might also be from multiple bombs being used on one target. Hard to tell, both is possible.
See?
basically everywhere that is not the US
That‚Äôs so wrong
Why don't they rat out the Hamas terrorists,  the war would be over
It‚Äôs fine. I was on a Kibbutz and they had a disco in a big shelter. Was quite alright even when packed and partying.
‚ÄúClaimed‚Äù say what you will about Isreal but in no other conflict is it ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù rebels or ‚Äúclaimed‚Äù Russian troops . It‚Äôs just rebels or troops.
I guess trying to divert their attention to the insanity with the government here. This next election could drastically change the country and not got the better.
LOL.  That‚Äôs not what that link says.

At least they have bomb shelters.. the civilians on the other side don‚Äôt.

Not entirely fool proof. But it does work more often than not. There‚Äôs a reason they train to that method. Also I feel like It would be somewhat obvious if you ended up crawling around in circles around a solitary pillar.
Its how we write dates in Israel (and Europe too, I believe)
PAKAR (IDF's Homefront Command) in Israel has *dozens* of SAR battalions, which are both trained as infantrymen and in SAR operations. They also have their own structural engineers embedded in the battalions. They can give SAR coverage to the entire country.
Where does it say they targeted the family? Not in that text. Targeting and unintentionally hitting are two different things.
A piece of advice, since you seem to be very young (or not very bright).Any time you want to write something like..."I hate X... **but** ..."... don't write it.
yes yes, sorry
The Yorktowns were stupidly strong.
Fair enough, I was under the impression that we're talking about the Israelis going forward, not the opposite. Had he said armed terrorists instead it would have been more clear to me.
That's some next level luck and good timing right there. :O
How about offering refuge for the Palestinians
That‚Äôs not what it says
All the excavation teams were busy digging tunnels to smuggle weapons and explosives in, sry.
The context of the thread starts with:&gt; What invading your neighbor that has Air Supremacy looks like, 3 weeks later.Who has air superiority? Israel. So who invaded? Hamas.Then there‚Äôs a question about the use of ‚Äúinvade‚Äù and in response OP says&gt; Is there another way to call several thousand armed men crossing the border, entering outposts, bases, villages and cities and shooting anyone in sight?A few thousand armed men entering villages and shooting anyone in sight - that again is Hamas on 10/7.Afterward I was adding context to someone who called it a raid, in that we‚Äôve seen interrogations saying the terrorists were supposed to take the land, but blamed Hamas leaders for abandoning them. To be fair, it does look like a raid given how equipped they were, but they weren‚Äôt talking about Israel.
It was mandatory in the time of the Cold War here in Switzerland to build a shelter in each house. It was both about the experiences of carpet bombing in WW2 and the nukes. We still have 100% capacity for the entire population of 9 mio. today.We used the shelter as store room for things, but we still had all the needed things there that were mandatory, like food supplies with canned goods, sealed water rations etc. The shelter also has an air ventilation system with filters and all that stuff.The door in my family home is made of a steel frame with a concrete layer, such doors can only be opened with special equipment from outside. There was never any case where any of these shelters would have been used, but well, it's better to be safe than sorry.We also had and still have some very big shelters for both the civilian population and the army, some are even good against nukes, as these are deep underground in the alps. Some of these can take up to \~30'000 people at once, so you can imagine the extreme size, all the space that is also needed for food, water reservoirs etc.Today, we often use these shelter for... well... you can guess it... weed plantages, it's ideal as a room underground and you can get rid of the smell with the air vent system.
And you can call it IDF mossad is doing shit you‚Äôll never know about. Gaza is an open air prison.
A little, yeah. I mean, I get it, all they hear about the middle east is that it's one big desert and think of places like Morrocow.
They were not built to deal with terrorists burning your house.
As a father, and indeed a human being, I found this hard to watch. That man's face is the picture someone staring at a future once full of love and family, now a desolation and a haunted solitude mocked by might-have-been. Unbearable.
Al Jazeera Arabic vs. Al Jazeera English.
26/10/2023?
&gt;No I think you‚Äôre mistakenI'm not. The definition of an attack or invasion is to assault, seize, and secure an area or location and hold the ground. A Raid is the same as an attack except with a planned withdrawal instead of holding. I've planned and executed enough to know this very basic verbage
Whoever does their PR should consider a legit career path
This since Wolfenstein 3D
Completely aggree. The secret is that the leadership in Israel knows that they are creating new fighters against them but that is the only way how asswipe-Netanjahu can keep his power. It is very much like Putlers play. They have to have enemy for the nation so they create that enemy. And that is the reason why "settlers" from Israel steal palestinian houses with the help of IDF or fill palestinian wells with concrete so that they have to move. They put pressure until situation explodes again and then they whine how it is impossible to live in peace with palestinians.
Fail
That's so embarrassing wow.
now show Palestinian families
Why do they then need and ask for billions $usd of aid every year (total \~250 billion without adjusting for inflation for such a tiny state).
Are those second detonations the rockets in the tunnels?
Great little vignette of the battle. More please!
Are these Hellfire or something else?
Cause this entire sub is a bot farm that is pro Israel like a mfer if you couldn‚Äôt already tell.
Right, so when you reach a dead end you go back to where you turned into it and proceed to the next turn. In a collapsed building going up is always better than down if you don‚Äôt know exactly where you are in relation to the outside. Going down just puts more rubble between you and potential rescue. It works. I‚Äôve done it many times.
When I was a kid one of the neighbors had the remnants of a  nuclear bomb shelter under their basement that we used to play in.  Whoever built it  ran a tunnel about 30 feet into their yard which ended in a ladder to, well, nothing, but was probably a blast door in the 1950's....I guess so that even if their house was flattened they could still  enjoy the nuclear winter outside. I wonder if some of those shelters have a similar feature--a passage to an area not likely to be covered by rubble, say a garden etc.
How exactly are you gonna shelter from 2000 pound bombs ?
No I think you‚Äôre mistaken
Yeah, but you get those who train at the moment and then still starting war. I believe if the scale of attack was known - it would be done, outrage be damned.
Until the maze has an isolated pillar anyway.  It's not an entirely foolproof method.
60 seconds
I know... But damn they had military training in the open... you don't need much just one chopper to buzzz them while training.
I‚Äôm not stuck in here with you, you‚Äôre stuck in here with me.
This is why Israel needs to get rid of Hamas. You can't let this go. It's a miracle that Israel hasn't done so already. Almost any other nation would have bombed Palestine into the ground decades ago.
I remember playing a MMORPG a few years ago, telling my party that I'm from Israel. They were amazed I had internet at all. They were convinced Israel uses camels for transportation and that Tel Aviv is basically a big building in the middle of the desert.It was hilarious. Too bad I couldn't see their faces.
No shit?
Could not see the attack coming that involved thousands but now knows who individuals are? More like: ‚ÄúJust bomb anybody that has a motorcycle or acts funny‚Äù
Can't wait for some of the main subs that have become massively anti-semitic dismiss this as an exception and deep fake
Following the wall only works if there are no loops. Going up at every opportunity only works if that leads you as far up as you can go.
It was all fun and games when they were facing women and children.
You mean Hamas? It was period of quiet. If you see outrage now, imagine what kind of outrage would be, if Israel attacked pre-emptively. Everyone knew they were training, it wasn't something new. The problem is overreliance on intel, which never suspected the scale of the attack, nor the date. They actually were really good in hiding, only 5 people apparently knew the plans, communications were by landline through tunnels, while probably orchestrating "business as usual" through cellular. Colossal failure of Shin Bet and Military Intel.
Should rewrite the headline...it conveys the wrong meaning
Should rewrite the headline...it conveys the wrong meaning
At least they have the option to see shelter.
Absolutely horrifying. Hope they're OK, and wish *every* civilian impacted by this war had a similar means of survival.
How the fuck did they let them train in public. Military training.
If a building is collapsing on top of you, no helmet is going to save your life. Nor if a bomb goes off near you, will that helmet save your life.
From some of the interviews with Oct7th people who were hiding in those bunkers while their house was on fire, the ventilation can be an issue.
Fam they paraglided into a music festival to slaughter hundreds of innocent people, bringing forth the wrath of JDAM showers. They're stupid.
It doesn't really matter that they didn't take a direct hit. They may not have many shrapnel injuries, but they were still very close to a very powerful munition going off. The pressure wave alone could very well be fatal depending on where they were and where the rocket hit, not to mention what it did to the ceiling/stuff around them turning into projectiles.The fact you don't hear screaming is not a good sign.
As I write this I can sense how it comes across as a stoned first year marketing studing thinking that they've got this great idea at a party, but here's my best attempt.  The media an individual consumes has never been more customized than it is today. While 25 years ago someone could change a news channel from CNN to Fox news. Opening YouTube, Instagram, TikTok has a wide range of experiences designed to keep you engaged, often via outrage.  Now that I've got that out, I'll talk about my personal experience.In my feeds I don't find the "pro-israel side" as monolithic as you make it out to be, especially when it comes to  "Gazan civilians shouldn't be targeted, but some amount of civilian casualties are unavoidable."   Also in my feeds the "Pro-Palestine side" is mostly trying to highlight that the casualty levels and suffering by Palestinians in Gaza is likely above that "some amount of civilian casualties are unavoidable" threshold. Maybe the Pro-Palestine side in my  circle isn't the same as the people you're talking about. But I don't think I would find anyone in my  social feed that would support the actions by Hamas on Oct 7th. Objectively, defining what amount of civilian casualties and suffering is acceptable is hard to quantify. And determining what is the casualty rate and how much suffering is being inflicted is also hard to know exactly.
Trying, this is still a very on going thing. Just yesterday four more tried coming from the sea.
Hell yea.
For that reason, most doors on those shelters open inwards. If still blocked, you are waiting for SAR.
When we learned about what the Nazis did. We truly believed that the world didn't react because there was no footage or media. We have that now and the world does nothing.
Literal nazis carrying out Hitler‚Äôs ideology.
I posted this yesterday and it was removed I really don't know why but if you want to see the true anguish and despair of atrocities look here. People need to understand and see how this genocide is truly ripping families apart!!! I have so much empathy for these people since my ancestors being black slaves faced atrocities on this scale and no one seemed to care.We live in a new world with technology that allows us a front row seat to the horrors of humanity and while it may seem goulash and wrong. Someone has to be there to cement these images in our minds again and again, until it stops. These people deserve life.IDF generals are telling soldiers to Shoot people in the back what the heck. The United States is calling it a war when bombs are being dropped on residential buildings and people are being catted to blast zones for collective execution. This is evil encrinite and we cannot stand by while this happens. I don't know why my video was removed but I wanted so badly to show the world the pain this man went through. Everyone needs to know his story and feel his loss.I will not speculate why my post was removed but I do know that it being removed is a serious issue that further allows for the dehumanization of the Palestinian people. Their stories must be told, their losses must be felt, their cries must be heard!https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/17g82my/journalist_mohammed_farra_in_ramallah_received/
Hey, there are a lot of hits on Gaza on this sub. But i am noticing a bias towards Hamas propaganda in leftist subs I frequent (ABoringDystopia for example). There, you get downvoted to the challenger deep for nuance. It may be possible that you are in an information bubble without realizing it.
They wouldn't need anything if they didn't start massacaring israelis.
Typically no. Israel has always done this, and it has been very effective in the west bank. I'm pretty conflicted about it, I don't think I would support such actions, but I understand why they're taken
Only the ones that have been build in the last 20 years or so.  also it's not a bomb shelter but a safe space in the apartment that is reinforced.BAck in the day when conventional war start Israel has public shelters.
This literally happens ALL THE TIME, you can literally type something like ‚Äúrobber shoots clerk mid theft‚Äù and you‚Äôll see how people will literally walk in and shoot you without saying a single word even if you only have $200 in your register.
And they tried to send more Hamas nazi's through the sea and tunnels.
Crazy people think Israel should just put up with thousands of rockets fired indiscriminately into civilian areas.
Just so we are on the same page...the fighters families are civilians, yes? Do houses/apartments have military value beyond punishment? Don't get me wrong, on the other hand I applaud some level of restraint. Hence feeling so conflicted. There is an absolute truth to the idea that Israel has the capacity to reduce the city to rubble, and stays it's hand. That said, it is exactly that military power that obligated Israel to play the role of a Great Power, which for me includes restraint.
Unfortunately they tried and succeeded 2 weeks ago... Imagine israel with no defence. it would be a literal genocide.
Never threaten the driver. He holds your life in his hands.
Really dude
Let me add a little context,  This is actually a very old building without a shelter.   The orders are to go down the staircase as the safest place to try to keep safe.
Feel bad if someone eats some chili and releases a death fart in the bunker. Can't escape that!
Do you have protective gear ?
I didn't think it was, but I've seen a LOT of comments who seemed to think so the past weeks
Oh absolutely there is a punishment motive, in knocking down buildings which once housed Hamas fighters and their families. There is many videos of those because they do warn before hitting them.
Surprisingly yes. A lot of my work colleagues honestly didn't know the first thing about Israel.
People still use Tick Tock?
wtf that is a war crime and the world will do nothing
But Israel told me they are only bombing Hamas
What about the Jews who lived there before?What the Palestinians also never mention is that at the same time as Britain allowed for European Jews to move in to the area, the British also allowed Arabs from Egypt, Jordan, Syria and other places to move in. For some reason the Palestinians don't differentiate them as *"settlers"*, *wonder why?* &gt;!/s!&lt;.73% of Israelis are Jews, around half of them are Mizrahi Jews who originate from the Middle East and have their entire lineage there. Add to that the 21% of Israelis who are Arab.So the "European settlers" narrative is just completely false since the vast majority of Israeli citizens are native to the region and don't have any origin in Europe.The only settlers are the Illegal settlers in the West Bank, you can critique those all you want. Plenty of Israelis do and for a reason. But what you are saying is simply Hamas propaganda with absolutely zero historical basis. That narrative only exist because the people promoting it don't want a state of their own next to Israel. They want Israel wiped off the map. So no wonder there is constant war with them.
Old shelters in Israel often have an emergency exit through a fortified window and some ventilation tubes.
Now imagine 7500 missiles which Hamass fired from Gaza and no iron dome.  And the far leftists claiming your not allowed to remove THAT threat from your enemy next door because some civilians will die in a war you didn‚Äôt start.It must be so frustrating  for Israel.
Kamakazi nailed the bridge directly
Holy fuck.
Lol is it contrary to popular belief that Israel is a modern society?
Uber driver here, I always thought about this too. A couple days ago I picked up a girl in a mid dangerous zone I use to work. All normal until she ask me to pickup a dude who was walking a couple streets far from where she lives. As soon as he gets in the car I had a bad feeling, and we took the highway right after that. Then I just drive like a freaking crazy, they were talking each other but as soon I gain velocity they remain silent. Luckily her stop was close to an highway exit, so that was it.
It‚Äôs astonishing that people think that drag queen shows reading books to young kids or learning Abp it being gay/trans or wearing a dress DOES ANYTHING AT ALL to your gender or sexual preference..people are legit so dumb and just don‚Äôt educate themselves..You are born the person you are! Like it or not
a lot less. Israel would have invaded gaza much earlier with the iron dome
I was told by reddit that only Israel shot at civilians. This must be fake.
Why is this upvoted but when I post a rocket landing on Palestinian‚Äôs it‚Äôs immediately downvoted? It‚Äôs almost like this sub has been astroturfed and used to push an agenda.
THIS is why Hamas rockets don't kill a "proportionate" number of Israeli.  Not because Hamas isn't trying...
Could you tell me about the 90k that were already there and when did those "European" Jews convert? And no they were nomads from Lebanon and Syria. They had 0 interest in a state. All the places kept their hebrew names and archeological evidence point to such.
Every day there are over a hundred launches. On the 24/7 live streams of the Gaza skyline you still see barrages go up now and then every day and we are 20 days into it.
I remember watching on TV as a kid scenes where they hold the driver at gunpoint, Always said to myself if that happens to me I am looking for the next incoming train or semi truck
So why jump out of the cars with the robbers?
But now he is outside the van with them with no card to play
Interesting dilemma:  You want the safe rooms to NOT be lockable, because you don't want rescue teams wasting time breaking locks when they are trying to extract the incapacitated people inside...  But then that's how many "safe rooms" were exploited by Hamas - it was a fucking arm wrestling match between the people inside and the terrorists outside leaning on the door handle...
Get your electricity
They were there before European Jewish settlers came over to ‚Äúclaim the land their book says is theirs‚Äù. Doesn‚Äôt matter if it wasn‚Äôt a ‚ÄúsTaTe‚Äù recognized by the whole world‚Äî it was their land and it still is.
The weird thing is a lot of people constantly playing both sides here - "Most Palestinians don't agree with Hamas, and Hamas is exceptionally brutal, but if they did agree with Hamas that would be okay, because they're freedom fighters, and Israel colonized them, but they don't want ALL Jews dead, but even if they do that's okay because they're fighting for a two state solution, which they rejected because they want all of Israel, but that's ok because the Jews there are all racist colonizers, but Civilians on both sides are innocent and want to live in peace."  Like... idk, the Pro-Israel side has picked a side and they're sticking to it - " Hamas is evil.  Gazan civilians shouldn't be targeted, but some amount of civilian casualties are unavoidable.  Al Jazeera is largely lying and reports out of Gaza can't be trusted at face value.  "But the Pro-Palestine side is all over the place ranging from literal Nazis to uninformed college students, with arguments ranging from "Push the Jews into the Sea" to "War bad.  Stop war!"
Yep, that's a hit on a weapons depot, no question. I wish more of the strikes made their strategic value as obvious. Still, there are plenty of strikes that don't look like this, some even targeting the same corridors folks have been asked to utilize to evacuate. And I have heard repeatedly (often from Israeli sources) that the choice has been made not to provide the traditional warning (dud artillery shells "knocking on the building" before a live round. My own conscious worries the "punish" motive has become very powerful. Which I can easily understand, but not support.
No matter what you're better off than just being trapped under the rubble, so there's that. I know it's different, but with our storm shelters we have doors that open inward so you do have the ability to open the door and try to dig through debris, if it's possible.  Other than that, just camp out and wait for rescue.
The news article calls him a hero, but youre right, he endangered a lot of other people while trying to save himself. I'm still on his side though.
They had the side door open. Would have been effective to make a nice hard right turn somewhere and have them go flying right out lmao.
One of these attacks was the assassination of Hassan Al-Abdullah, the commander of Hamas' Northern Khan Yunis rocket launching unit.
Everybody hates code enforcement, until disaster happens.
Hamas targets Israeli civilians while simultaneously hiding behind their own.They are pure evil and need to be removed from the earth.
If you are willing I emplore everyone to watch this and feel what he feels. He should not have to suffer alone, we all must cary his burden and do better.&gt; https://www.reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/comments/17g82my/journalist_mohammed_farra_in_ramallah_received/
I guess every shelter/bunker has emergency hatch, because it would be stupid to not have it.

&gt; This is what firemen do tooThat‚Äôs where I learned it. I spent three years in [this](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_Biological_Incident_Response_Force) Marine Corps battalion and part of the initial training included confined space rescues and collapsed structures, which are very much in the wheelhouse of fire departments. Beyond that we cross-trained with fire departments at sites all over the place, as well as annual training events with FDNY at their academy.
Yeah, they fucking packed the tunnels full of fucking rockets and other explosives vs helping their own people. Religious fucking zealots.
It must get a bit stuffy but the responders come to rescue very fast. They are not going to wait there for hours unless something goes very wrong.
If you have tiktok, look up crisa_lis.
The slaughter and torture on Israeli soil this time should even give someone like the current President a mandate to finish the job.
Why are comments in threads of Israel bombing Palestinians locked?
People seem to think the rockets stopped after the 7/10 attack and only Israel is doing bombing when in reality they have continuously fired thousands of rockets ever since.
But twitter told me this war is one sided
Bingo.
Iran won't attack directly, that's why they use the web of proxies, yeah. While it's not existential threat, it's still unacceptable.
All those rockets and tunnels were made with humanitarian aid that Hamas was supposed to use to improve the lives of the Gazans.
But the analogy holds there too. Iran doesn't want to push Israel over the edge, it's a nuclear power.But this latest terror attack seemed to be designed to keep Israel from building closer relationships to other Arab countries.
Only the ones constantly under attack.
Because all the resources sent for aid go to building rockets and attack tunnels. They want to kill Jews more than they want to protect their children.
Israel doesn't feel threatened because Israel built bomb shelters for its citizens, while Hamas built tunnels for its militants.
Pretty much all of them are just an empty room. They usually hold your home's cleaning supplies.
It's plausible. But just as you said, i'm not really sure about that now. We have to factor in their Iranian overlords.
basically if a Westerner is able to see Palestinians as the equivalent of slaves, it's then easy to see Hamas' behavior as like a slave revolt.  nobody observing history really cares how brutal a slave revolt is.  you don't criticize slaves for revolting or what their means were; they have no agency.  and you don't feel much sympathy for the people complicit in the slavery.  ending slavery is the only issue that actually matters.  if someone goes "okay sure slavery bad but do you at least condemn the brutal actions of the slaves?" you might well say "dude, you're missing the point completely to try to get me to talk shit about *slaves.*"  i rarely hear the word slave used in dialogue about Palestine, but there is a lot of other language/propaganda used to try to basically get people to that place mentally.  i disagree with this perspective, but i can understand it i guess.  most people are just parroting whatever opinion their social sphere has and they don't go much deeper than that.
Might be automatic scan of security camera.
Ah good advice. This is what firemen do too(minus the up). In the movies you can see to navigate around wherever they are, but IRL shits often completely black.    In an AI class back in college, this was also a method you can use to defeat mazes.
they have plenty of tunnels, but those aren't for lowly civilians.
yes and no. If there wasn't an Iron Dome, I think Hamas would launch less rockets because they wouldn't want to trigger total war with Israel. Hamas aren't completely stupid, they don't want to be completely destroyed, well at least that's what I thought before October 7th.
Most bunkers have ventilation, not really an issue.. before the iron dome we had to just hide in bunkers and hope for the best.. sometimes for days.
&gt;Israel doesn't want Palestinians to have bomb shelters&amp;#x200B;israel prevents palastinians from digging or building?&amp;#x200B;then how come there's entire tunnel networks under an entire city? doesn't israel know you have to dig to build tunnels, and you also have to dig to lay foundations of high rise buildings. how can israel not want palastine to have bombshelters, but then palastine does have shit like tunnals and foundations for buildings? is israel stupid?
Link?
Probably should have.
Always built with 2 exits, they have a building code to follow and only certain company's can build them. usually a door inside the house and then a protected window(steel hatch or impact resistant glass) which can be opened in case the house starts burning.
First of all, I hope they are okay. They were just innocent humans living there, now they don't have a home, which is a sad thing no matter the side the innocents are hurt on. Secondly both sides are still bad in this while thing. I'm not going to say anything positive about someone having a rocket explode their house. That is just yet another atrocity in all of this, and it is a terrible thing to happen to humanity. It isn't just this conflict, it is all conflicts happening on our planet. All of it is bad, it is a loss for humanity.
Well if you ever get stuck in a collapsed building and can move, put your right or left hand on the closest wall and follow it wherever it goes, and go up at every opportunity you come across.  Eventually you‚Äôll find a way out if there is one.Edit: This also works for hedge and corn mazes, FYI.
&gt; If you're going to dislike this comment, please educate me on why I'm wrong first...Because although Hamas are a relatively new organisation, Muslim attacks of Jews in the region go back over 100 years at this point, before Israel ever even existed. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1920_Nebi_Musa_riotshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1929_Hebron_massacrehttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Hand_(Mandatory_Palestine)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1936%E2%80%931939_Arab_revolt_in_Palestine
That is terrifying. Id at least need a shit ton of batteries and an angle grinder to start my way out. I'd rather die from the rocket than die being trapped under tons of rubble.
The immediate concern is simply to survive the impact. Just like tornado shelters. Rescue comes later.
Nah, Israel would've went to all our war much sooner.
Yeah I know. I'm not talking about Hamas not having bomb shelters. I'm talking about the civilians. All of Hamas can be blown to shit for all I care but that's not what's happening. Now Hamas will have plenty of orphans to exploit.
Why don't Palestinians have water, food and electricity now? Israel doesn't want Palestinians to have bomb shelters, just like they don't want them to have clean drinking water.
Vape
Israel created this problem it's insane how they not even trying for peace.
u/ApoliteTroll here‚Äôs one
Not sure in this instance, but some homes have places that are called bomb shelters that are mostly just where there is reinforced beaming. There are legit ones but many people refer to their space of refuge as a bomb shelter even if it is not purpose built.
&gt; But to think that many people in the western Media are openly supporting the Hamas.Um no.We cannot even ask Israel to stop bombing innocent children in the west without being called an Anti Semite.
While Hamas have shelters for bombs.
What about air?
A pity there is no FPV cam of the van. Would be interesting to see how other vehicles or pedestrians perceived that smooth stroll around town...
So everything you said justifies the death of 5,000 civilians? Innocent mothers and children?
Hamas is ok with Genocide it is why they hide amongst civilians.  You choose to fight someone do you stand next to your love ones while fighting risking a stray punch to hit them?  Hell no you would be an idiot to do so. Should the person being forced to fight you just not fight because you are putting your family at risk?  See this is common sense shit.  Hamas are the problem and the IDF will delete them. Now move bitch get out the way.
Seems logical since that's what Hamas says about Jew's killing them all.
Why waste billions to protect your civilians (like Israel does) when they are already brainwashed to believe they'll become martyrs if killed?
Wait who is steering the camera?‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.lol
There was no such thing as the Palestinian state and Arabs are the colonizers just like in north Africa.
If we‚Äôre going to talk about cause and effect, don‚Äôt you think the cause of the 70+ year cycle was the inability for Arabs to accept a fairly equal land partition and subsequently launch an *actual* genocidal war on Israel in 1948? While we‚Äôre talking about cause and effect, don‚Äôt you think the cause of Gaza and the West Bank being blockaded was the second intifada? Prior to which, there was no blockade on those territories?
Just the ones that get rocket attacks on a daily basis.
The problem is that Israel's army is conscripted - the way you stop your civilians getting rocketed is to put them in uniforms and send them into a city to get shot at and mined instead.The 'containment' policy that included Iron Dome and the walls and the odd air strike was almost precisely to avoid that. Everyone knew containment had a time limit on it, but I don't think many were expecting such a sudden and explosive end to it.
Maybe a stupid question... but do all developed, eastern nations have bomb shelters built into their homes/apartments??
Nope. Protesting the Hamas massacre being completely ignored by the media.
How is that Combat footage?
Imagine how many more direct hits would have happened without iron dome
It's pretty common for an invasion to happen precisely because the invader thinks the land is rightfully theirs; an attacker not-wanting a border to be there doesn't mean they're not crossing it.
All the mamads I've been in have hatches to the next floor or go outside. Everything is locked from the inside.
They used their money to build tunnels for terrorists instead.
Well, 'raid' is maybe a little more accurate a term for it than 'invasion' since they had no great desire to hold the ground. But that's a pretty semantic nitpick and arguably the first part of a raid is an invasion anyway :)
Important to note that the rockets they‚Äôre shooting at central Israel aren‚Äôt the shitty water pipes ones. Can‚Äôt shoot those to such a distance.
I agree that you would probably want to listen to someone in this situation, what I don't agree with is assuming someone won't kill you when you do what they want. These people robbing him obviously aren't smart individuals with rational morals/thoughts, so why put trust in them?
I have the gut feeling this is just the beginning.
That‚Äôs usually why you have a bunch of supplies to wait for rescue.
&gt;Hamas is a resistance forceSo killing and kidnapping civilians, raping women, driving a car with a young girl tied behind until all of her bones are broken... All of these are "acts of resistance". Ok, got it. /sHope you will not experience this kind of "resistance" on yourself.
as a victim whats the best action i can take while I'm at gunpoint?
I watched a video of a tour of one of these in home shelters. It was quite interesting and they have to be build by a specific company and to proper code and have two exits, power and a phone. The one in the video had a very elaborate super enforced window escape route.
Hamas wastes all money in large tunnels for their war machine and military industrial complex.
Are you going to assume someone that will rob someone at gunpoint is smart to begin with? Do you know how many people are in prison for the rest of their lives for murdering someone that said something they didn't like?
Yes, I think that is true from the Israeli perspective.  But from the international perspective, the hostages are what truely gives Israel freedom of action right now.
&gt; Hamas is a resistance force. Without Israel, there are no hamas.   "Without the Jews there would be no Auschwitz." WTF is the matter with you. Wake up.
damn, imagine electing a local government that gives a shit about civilians.
so that's why they're called bomb shelters.&amp;#x200B;damn, these israeli people fleeing their bedrooms have got it all wrong!
My grandmother did this. A man with a gun jumped in her car at a red light. Her instinct was to floor it. She started racing through red lights screaming if I die you die! The dude was begging to be let out.
We don't have to do your thinking for you. But if you think cutting the heads off babies is a legitimate thing for a freedom fighter to do then no amount of explaining will likely change your mind. Not are you worth explaining it to.
It would pale in comparison if that dude was in a gang or something and his homies heard him screaming like a little bitch
&gt;Hamas is a resistance force.bro thinks cutting off heads of infants is resistance.&amp;#x200B;bro figures anti-semitism is resistance.&amp;#x200B;bro really out here proclaiming sharia law is the judicial system of any resistance.&amp;#x200B;bro really gonna sit there and claim isis were liberators if you boil him long enough lmfao.&amp;#x200B;if hamas is resistance, why doesn't it attempt to protect the local population from attack? are they stupid?
It‚Äôs not easy, but people sure are fucking stupid enough to try.
That poor traumatized van lmao
You can be a resistance force without terrorising everyone around you, including the people you claim to defend.
Israel's underground bomb shelters are for keeping people safe. Hamas on the hand literally have bombs sheltered underground.
I think in some shelters they have a phone or some way to call for help i would hope so atleast i could be wrong they could Just use their phones
Hostages is only one aspect of this. Even if all hostages released for some reason (they won't let all go), there's a matter of still having Hamas on the border. It's like having Al-Qaeda set up their little state in Brooklyn, after attacking the towers in Manhattan.
Israel did confirm that they specifically targeted his family that evacuated as ordered by the Israeli military.https://twitter.com/ittay78/status/1717503112649330703
The causes is Israel absorbing Palestinian land, subjugating their people and insidiously dismembering any cultural or meaningful area for the last 70 years. I hate hamas terrorists, but hamas are a result of Israel and their brutal terrorist imperialism. It doesn't take intelligence to see the cause and effect.Hamas is a resistance force. Without Israel, there are no hamas.If you're going to dislike this comment, please educate me on why I'm wrong first...
I hate how many children are being affected by this BS. As a father it's even more wrenching.
That is horrifically accurate
Contrary to popular belief and been situated in the middle east despite not having any oil, Israel is quite an advanced western society and they have emergency services that are trained to respond to these events.
I don't think the Israelis will be stopped by the west while there are still significant numbers of hostages.  If it ever get's down to 1 or 2 then maybe, but until we even get near there they can basically operate to their hearts content.
* Hamas to Israel: "We're launching rockets at you, Israel! Fear us!"* Hamas to world: "These are just harmless homemade firecracker rockets! Look at these Israeli bombs!"* Hamas to Israel: "The entire Gaza population is ready to die, you cannot defeat us!"* Hamas to world: "The Israelis are killing our civilians! Help us!"I notice a pattern here...
It was low hanging fruit.
Thousand shitrockets is still thousand shitrockets. Massive failure rate doesnt exactly mean they are harmless.
There were invasions, just politicians always crumbling under international pressure and never letting army finish the job.We'll see how it goes this time. And if it's gonna be the same, we'll see another round of violence in a few years time. More deaths, more destruction, rinse and repeat. From the looks of it, US, France, Britain all agree Hamas needs to go. Can't go back to October 6th. But the more civilians dying in the war, the more pressure would be applied on all allies to cease fire. Hamas knows this, it's their main card. That's why they are blocking civilians from evacuating, maximizing use of Pallywood, inventing 500 dead in the parking lots, etc. It's their out, always have been.
military industrial complex go brrrrrrrr
I would have to agree.
Rockets? You mean flying water pipes that my European taxes paid them? /s
The same reason they don't have air raid sirens or preplanned evacuation plans for the next inevitable clash.It would be defeating the purpose.
Damn, you were faster
Yeah no shit hamas rapes too
Oh they have bomb shelters, Hamas just uses them to shelter bombs.
all answers are in the Bible,  the devil is behind all of this!   but still many people don't believe that!
Adding to this, where are they getting their ‚Äúintel‚Äù from? It‚Äôs obviously bad intel.
&gt;well, some might say that land was their all along. so.. dunno.You might be surprised to discover that in the majority of invasions worldwide people claim the land was theirs all along.
Saw a post on there that was showing Instagram posts of people under #TelAviv in restaurants and relaxing, arguing that it meant there was no threat whatsoever to Israelis. People really shouldn‚Äôt use TikToks to determine their political views.
Wait for SAR to find the door and open it.
There are plenty of bomb shelters there. Sheltering bombs and rockets.
There have always been and will always be people who see "gaza health ministry" for example as a source and lack the knowledge to check who they are.
But we are told that Hamas rockets are bad so Israel should not feel threatened.
&gt; crossing the borderwell, some might say that land was their all along. so.. dunno.
Can‚Äôt imagine trying to explain this situation to children
Absolutely fucking heart breaking. This poor soul. The spiral of violence is eternal. No amount of death and destruction can stop it.Just imagine all of the possible futures that have been wiped out in just the past few weeks - ignoring the past several decades. What a waste.
yes
Over the last decade on average, a journalist has been killed every four days while bringing us the world news. Ironically it does not mention their families
idiots that havn't got a clue what they're on about buying in to the victim-role of hamas.&amp;#x200B;they're idiots. hamas isn't the victim of anything. it's the cause.
Immediate response by search and rescue for all direct hits.
I know this is a satire. But to think that many people in the western Media are openly supporting the Hamas. I wondered 'what the hell is going on the west?'
At least they have bomb shelters.
Stay safe
Disgusting who support raping children/ women
◊§◊ß◊¢"◊® will get you out
that's was like 500 meters from me, crazy
Yeah, Qassams at "Gaza Envelope" Israeli communities. The only thing that stood between them and rockets were "Red Alert" sirens and shelters. With between 10 to 15 seconds to find cover.So this necessitated system like Iron Dome. Paradoxically, if Iron Dome was never produced, the war would probably be over a long time ago. No-one would sustain that much rockets for a long time.
What I always wonder. Bomb shelters they usually have 1 door. When a house gets blasted and the rubble blocks the door. How TF do you get out?
damn actually like a minute after
This used to a very common occurance before the Iron Dome became a thing.
Brave, brave man üíØ But he couldn't even catch back up with his own rolling car ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ funniest shit ever!!! Hearing the little bitch screaming in the back hahahaha
Judging by the timestamp, it's yesterday's direct hit in Rishon LeZion.[Here's aftermath](https://imgur.com/a/qgvha7y). 3 lightly wounded.Just underscores the importance of not relying solely on Iron Dome.
I have been informed by TikTok posts on TikTok cringe that actually all Israelis are children playing in sprinklers all the time so please delete this you are making favorite TikToker look evil and that's just not ok/s

You ‚Äúpeople‚Äù make it easy to do. You‚Äôre legit okay with a genocide.
^classic virtue weaponization
Trump supporter didn't pass English class and/or is totally stoned
I think the man didn't care. He was saying, "All of us will die." Once they didn't fire right away, they lost. As soon as he went that fast, they would have all died once they pulled the trigger. A 100mph crash. Granted, they could have shot him once they got out, but I also don't think dude cared.
I didn‚Äôt notice that, thank you. He had it pointed at the driver‚Äôs head the whole time, you can see a few moments where he expected it to fire. Crazy.
Something like this would radicalise me in all the worst ways, and this is happening to most Palestinian people. I can only imagine what this is going to grow into
Exactly Jews walking around thinking they better than somebody you would have thought it was their land to begin with lmao look stupid af
Okay what in the fuck did I just watch? I need a part 2 so badly
They about the damn same in my book now watch people try to distinguish the 2 when the ku klux klan pretty much did the same nasty disgusting acts Hamas did prolly killed more people than Hamas might I add
*rates five stars*
Another video where IShowSpeed is being annoying and screaming lmao
I hate when I do not do proportionality correctly!   "teensy" is so much more accurate, thank you.&amp;#x200B;/s: I hope you can read between the lines, love you!
Israel has the 5th strongest military in the world. I am furious about this.
Hahahahaha "If I'm dead, WERE ALL DEAD!" Amazing.
why would they shoot if you do what they want? its not that easy to get away with murder anymore
Is interesting how beautiful it is but it has a dark side, about moving people from their houses and extract litio
&gt; this is not worth the risk.People will shoot regardless, at least going fast ensures they get injured too if they pull the trigger
People don't want to see
this is not worth the risk. People, never assume they won't pull the trigger no matter their size or age.

[here is an example from yesterday of what they are bombing](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/YqC5hbyH6K) notice the significant secondary explosions, evidence of stored munitions. They are also destroying Hamas residences, with significant warning, to punish the participants of October 7.

A lot of the missiles are reloads for Iron Dome, that shit gets pricy fast, and they are burning through interceptors.  Israel bout to be at war on two fronts if Syria gets involved.  Gotta re up the squad.
Oh Hamas definitely has support I know that lol. You see people cheering at rockets getting launched at Israel, you see cheering on the ‚Äúsoldiers‚Äù. I have no doubt Hamas has support. I simply mean I hope voices of reason and peace aren‚Äôt being killed.
Downtown Houston has generally gotten more lively specifically around this area in the last few years (minus the pandemic ones).
I agree but the problem is that‚Äôs not what most people in Palestine want. The problem is if they have anyone speaking out against Hamas they‚Äôll be killed. That‚Äôs what I hear at least, hopefully it‚Äôs not true.
I‚Äôd be willing to bet your tax dollars support Israel, contrary to what your mouth says.
Look at all these losers üòÑ
I'm not liberal but I think you've gone a little too far off the deep end my man. A lot of what you're saying is just not the case so don't believe everything you hear in the media. The paranoia is a waste of energy.
Yeah it's clearly backfiring already. You can see it if you are objective. Too many ppl let their ego get tied to their opinion... it's weird.
I'm glad you're okay, sometimes you just don't know.
Jews, Christians and Muslims live peacefully side by side in Israel and have been for a long time. Gaza on the other hand...
True, but that didn‚Äôt make me almost dizzy. :-)
Can't listen. What's it saying?
Sooo Israel was so nice they supplied the power water and warned civilians about air strikes. But there the bad guys. Lol.
The look on their faces after they realize the guy is out like, ‚Äúwell, damn, what tf do we do now?‚Äù has me rolling
I'm surprised to see downtown so lively after 6pm.
The bright light shining directly into the camera at the start didn't really help things, either.
Beautiful
I‚Äôm not trying to say Israel is innocent. Just sick of people justify terrorism. Also I‚Äôm aware what it is, and I‚Äôve seen no evidence of white phosphorus. Other than one video that I‚Äôm pretty sure was old. My evidence is all over the new testimony and pictures of the the attack. The IDF itself released recovered GoPro footage from Hamas fighters its all over the internet. I‚Äôve reposted it a million times. Check my post history if you can‚Äôt find it.  I do not support what Israel has done in Palestine just don‚Äôt think it justifies slaughtering innocent people. They could have chosen to attack military and government target they chose to attack innocent people. You sound like your justifying terrorism when you say what do you expect. In fact I would probably have been on their side of the attacks were aimed at IDF and government targets. Also, it‚Äôs not that simple. Hamas continually attacks Israel and is the reason isreal has taken its hard stance. Your looking at this from one side the truth is generally somewhere in the middle.
Good for them for taking care of the situation. But it‚Äôs a bit difficult to watch when you pointed the camera to the ground and all that, instead of staying on what was happening.
Right, it's going to backfire.
The new speaker of the house said that getting isreal funding through the house is top priority

And that's the fundamental mistake.  They aren't going to be able to spin this.
Israel said they‚Äôd worry about public relations after they kill them all
It's not simple.  If it were only killing terrorists that's fine, but this response has been too sloppy, and it's going to take a toll on Israel's reputation.  Either they are purposefully targeting civilians, aid workers, and journalists or they are incompetent.  Look at the difference in the incidental deaths between Ukraine and Gaza.   Israel is fucking themselves up, and it's going to hurt us all.
And he's selling it as "jobs."  We need someone else next term.
Because it's what it's meant for: killing terrorists.  This shit was already paid for before you were born. Why do you think the defense budget is always so high? Isreal develops the best weaponry. We are allies. When you are allies you help each other. It's really simple.
So you are justifying terrorism? Your justifying raping innocent women and girlsYour justifying shooting innocent people in the streetYour justifying family‚Äôs found on their front porch, all tortured to death. Your justifying burning people alive Your justifying kidnappingShall I go on?

Yeah I really wouldn't be surprised if Russia had some type of heads up about this. Especially since this new conflict is beneficial for them in that it has the potential to divert the US's attention away from Ukraine. It should also be noted that Iran and Russia really weren't that close with eachother until the Ukraine invasion popped off and Putin reached out to Tehran out of necessity
That‚Äôs actually nuts though. I‚Äôm not sure I would be ok with people dressing my boy as a girl. What‚Äôs going on with the world ?
He don‚Äôt want his son in a dress. How is that fragile. Why would a teacher put the boy in a dress without the fathers co sent or even knowledge about how the parent feels about certain topics. Would it be cool if a teacher dressed up a kid like Trump when the had a thing about presidents not knowing if the parent didn‚Äôt like Trump or the presidential system in general.

Ask a therapist.
I absolutely have watched them.The oxygen at 35,000 feet is the problem, and the weight of parachutes and not being able to even use them is an incentive to not even try bringing them on the plane.And yes, inflating the life vest is useless in the air as it only obstructs mobility and has no use.
It's his son, if he does not want him in a dress, then he has every right to tell the staff no, do not do it.   That's it.
The Nazis oppressed progressive Germans as well. This didn't hinder the Allies to carpet bomb german cities - just to fight the evil.
There are sick people in the Middle East, and it's not about land. it's about killing jews all they want to do there the ones who want genocide not isreals
Hamas is their elected government dummy. They support this. Why don‚Äôt people research before they comment
You know what I mean. The people in Gaza are oppressed by Hamas as well.  Actually I just googled it, and Ku Klux Klan had more members then Hamas.
That's a Weber. It comes from Home Depot.

Not sure you guys know what fragile masculinity is. But ok
Russia is allied with Iran, and Iran funds Hamas and Hezbollah.  They will not be reconsidering their alliance without something making them do that.  Iran is also building and exporting many of the drones that Russia uses against Ukraine, so there's another connection there.
What's hilarious about this comment, aside from how wrong is it, is that prior to the 1920s, [all little boys were put into dresses](https://daily.jstor.org/boys-in-dresses-the-tradition/) up until about the age of 6 or 7.It didn't "shape their entire personalities."  It wasn't really a big deal at all.  I have a picture of my grandfather at the age of 4 or 5 in a dress.  You probably do, too.  Here is a childhood picture of Franklin D.

Or they buy land legally, then that seems to upset lots of Palestinians. When rich Jews who are forced out their countries of origin come along with tonnes of cash then those selling Palestinians seem to be targeted. Weird.

You sound like the boomers in Russia that keep asking for more blood shed, while the young soldiers are suffering from having to kill people and carrying the guilt of war profiteers.Wild how Israel was the one that told Russia ‚Äúthere are no winners in war, you get to lose even if you win‚Äù

"Israelian"? "pay the prize"?
"Let's support them, they won't harm us."
since day 1 hamas said they'd release them if Israel released the prisoners they have, also for the past 10 years of wars, media coverage was lacking, this evidence was never there, now even Obama came out yesterday saying that "Israel would have to abide by international law if they want to continue to be an American ally", besides the numerous Israeli's who protested this war, but somehow I keep stumbling on the 1% who are bibi supporters online
If you are against this in the west then leave. Yanks are our bank we don‚Äôt want opinions do what ye were created to do fund Europe
Ask your daddy Hamas Or the rest of your dirty circus
You could throw a rock into Gaza and Hamas will say it killed 100 people.Funny how it works, Hamas just makes all of these claims with no proof, and then the burden of proof falls on Israel to prove they didn‚Äôt do it.When the news first came out, people insisted it had to be an Israeli JDAM because only that had the firepower to level a hospital and kill that many.Now that we know that neither a hospital was leveled, nor 500 people killed. It was a small blast in a parking lot next to a hospital with a pothole sized impact crater, which aligns perfectly with the power of a Hamas rocket.If 500+ people somehow did die, Hamas was responsible for their deaths.
God people are funny.

I watched a show about serial killers once that talked about this being one way that fetishes are born. One side encouraging it and one side having a huge negative overreaction to it.

No, actually, it wouldn't. What an incredibly ignorant thing to say. This is imaginative play, a completely normal and healthy part of childhood development. This father's reaction accomplished one thing and one thing only - to shame his child for normal human behavior, teaching him that he is somehow bad. If you care to understand anything about the impact of shame I recommend Brene Brown's work; she's studied it intensively.If a child enjoys dressing up in any other sort of costume do you say, "Oh no, little Bobby's going to start thinking he's a dinosaur if we keep letting him put on the t-rex costume. Better put a stop to it before he forms his whole personality around it." BTW, in many past civilizations, men wore "dresses", dressed extremely flamboyantly, rocked wigs and frills and lace and even makeup. Heels were literally invented for men. Our perceptions of gender are socialized. Pick up a book, jfc.
Israeli politicians are fucking unhinged
Imagine if Gaza built infrastructure instead of weapons
Lol at all of the people in these comments thinking that shaming a kid and then posting a video is good parenting.
Seems an odd thing to do on a crowded street ü§£ a little invasive, as a Christian I wouldn't do it personally just because I don't believe my religion should have any impact on others. And the Jewish people were kind enough to help with the actual reenactment which was very kind ü§£

Be that guy.
Homemade missiles which are garbage from the outset and not capable of killing 500+ people.  Missles built in the USA and deployed indiscriminately by Isreal are capable though.
Idiots..
If only the actions of the IDF and Israeli government didn't make it so easy to believe.
So why do people even bother calling themselves chosen or not? Why add labels? Why not just everyone live peacefully without religion, and if the Christian god does exist then they can make judgement if needed?
Then join the foreign legions.
That doesn't work when neither side wants to try any more. At that point it comes down to the side that tries to stay away from the other side's territory until they are attacked on their own territory are probably the more aggrieved side at the current point in time.
This is war. The authors of a lot of the Geneva convention firebombed Dresden causing the death of 10s of thousands of Germans over a 2 day pariod, and later went on to condone the slaughter lf a few hjndred thousand Japanese civilians via just 2 bombs. It sucks, but that is war, it is brutal. Hamas started this current war knowing full well how brutal the repercussions would be. War is not fair and collateral damage is generally accepted in this day and age. Unless armed forces deliberately try to kill civilians instead of strategic targets (IE what Hamas did) then it's seldom considered a war crime except by outraged but powerless civilians with relatively short attention spans.
This is how you get mud on the back of your head and somehow in your crack, speaking for a friend.
That escalated quickly.

Didn't anyone tell him that Israelis *are* the nazis now?
This was an argument presented to me recently. Would I feel comfortable with my daughter sharing a bathroom with a trans woman. My answer to this is, if this is a concern then should anyone feel comfortable allowing kids to share bathrooms with adults at all regardless of the gender? I think building gender fluid bathrooms that provide full privacy for each stall should be the solution. On another note, pretty sure it isnt that difficult to explain to a child that people of different genders share the same bathroom just like we do at home.
And if people focused on higher education and truly understanding each other then we wouldn't be in this situation at all the whole point is that.... There's no point unless y'all there y'all don't know shit
Can anyone give context about what happened. This look perfectly staged. Anyone got the link of the original post?
Had this conversation with a dude recently about why his kid is in a private Catholic school in lieu of a great public school in his neighborhood. Reason? "I don't have to worry about explaining boys in the women's restroom." His kid is a boy.Edit: I didn't like a word
It's called the Geneva convention look it up... The world came together and decided what was allowed and what was not allowed also surprise surprise this is not war this is just mindless killing on both sides have all the soldiers choose a battlefield... Genocide is genocide no matter what side you are on innocent civilians shouldn't be dying at this rate it's not the norm unless the sole purpose was to do it since the beginning and no I'm not taking any fucken sides because I'm not there plain and simple for all I know this could be one giant hoax just so ww3 could start no one knows unless you are there to witness it
Uyuni! Such a cool place to visit

When they start putting Gazans in ovens, instead of letting them elect their own government even if said government has one policy that is essentially the elimination of Jews from the Levant, while feeding, watering and providing electricity and telcommunications to that nation for nearly 2 decades, you jight have a point.

So most Christians.
They kind of are, because a lot of their rockets are low tech and imprecise and prone to failure. They just don't give a fuck when a few of them fail catastrophically and land on Gazans, as long as they were aimed at Israel.

Opening it mid-air? Bro everyone close to the door (himself included) would be sucked out of the plane in a second and if the exit was in the front or middle the wing motor could just explode and everyone on the plane would be as good as dead (unless they were lucky) and the emergency exit can get opened easily with my proof being that idiotic dude who opened the emergency door when the plane was landing (happened in south korea I think).
I think that is they did win this war, who would they then target next. Hamas would be on a high and move on to another group.
You park rocket launchers and strategically important military facilities beside hospitals and a church, regardless of how primitive they may be, you risk collateral retaliatory damage. But Hamas counts on this. They declare the victims glorious martyrs while demanding the west sympathise with the plight of their meatshields. Because Hamas don't care about their civilians.
The idea of 'cultural appropriation' confuses me. Surely as humans, we take the best from each community and use it or expand on it. That is what happened with the wheel.
The only opposing source at this point is Hamas, and their credibility almost is up their with my meth head cousin.
It burned a car park, if it was a US or Israeli manufactured air launched ordinance the damage would have been at a much different scale
Fucking asshole really.  Folks doing this deserve some sort of lesson‚Ä¶hopefully he learned it
And you support Hamas!
Not Hamas but actually Palestinian Islamic Jihad, one of the other political ally groups in Gaza whose sole objective is also the eradication of Israel but who aren't in power, so they don't have access to all the foreign aid money to buy the good rockets with to launch at Israel instead of improving Gazan's quality of life, and thus have to Macguyver their own instead.
He's an asshole, but he also couldn't negotiate with people with no interest in actual negotiation.
There have been regular videos of religious Jewish extremists spitting on Arabs. Also, Christian tourists interested in seeing the 'supposed' birthplace of Christ. There has been a video of an official asking a Bishop to take off his cross - he said, I wear this every day. I thought Israel was a democracy. It appears to be masquerading as a democracy.
There was no war, until Hamas decided to slaughter 1000+ Israeli civilians. There wouldn't have been war if they hadn't decided to do that.
I dunno, I'd snifferwolf

There are 2 Palestinian pseudo states. Gaza is not the one that has an issue with illegal Jewish settlement. The scenarios are not really comparable.
Israel is acting like the nazis since ages....and one of the reasons Russia attacked Ukraine is because of the nazis which corrupted the government etc. Nice education. Typically for a politician.
This is true.  Men only do things that benefit them.  Why has religion been kept alive and educated throughout the past 2000 years?  Was there some new discovery into the scripture that we didn‚Äôt know about?  Why take the effort to educate and keep religion alive?  Religion has no place in government.  It‚Äôs man written (imagine the heresay across thousands of years on what should be words from god directly, passed from man to man, rewritten and rewritten.  It‚Äôs to benefit man, if religion did not benefit man it would‚Äôve ceased to be passed on this long
it the other way around
I‚Äôm glad we live on this planet
So what are they gonna do? Send the Mossad to karate chop the shit out of Russia?
It‚Äôs always because someone riled the Israeli cops up, it‚Äôs unfortunate that it doesn‚Äôt take much but at the same time something always happens for a reason. But someone tries to get away with a physical altercation in the scenario and the whole crowd pays for it.

Is it a tool hamas made up with their hamas magic?
I‚Äôd play stupid and ask why
Not trying to defend their point, but Hamas kinda does bomb themselves. Up to 25% fail rate on their rockets has a lot of their own rockets hitting Gaza.
Seems to me they consider gentiles lower than dogs
You‚Äôre talking like hamas is bombing themselves, you‚Äôre actually not far off from the Russian propaganda everyone was calling silly last year
Source ? Because that's top nothing but bullshit.The hate is recent because of Western interference in the Middle East.During the middle ages, the arab world was the only place Jewish people could have a measure of safety and acceptance, while they faced progrom after pogrom until WW2 in Europe.The people of Europe have always been the Jews' worst enemy.

They're *not inextricable* either.Saying every homophobe is just repressing their sexuality doesn't actually help and it still casts being queer / gay as a negative because it tries to make the offender feel bad by using *queerness as a weapon* to attack them."You hate gay people? Well it's probably because you're gay! Doesn't that make you uncomfortable?"If we're calling out bigots' toxic masculinity or religious extremism (which are the actual culprits) then we should just *do that*, and skip the step where we use queerness as a boogeyman to "gotcha" them.
Gottem.
Because since the war with Ukraine, Israel has given a lot of Russian oligarchs and their money a way out of Russia by either legitimate or dubious claims of Jewish heritage.Also good old cold war stuff

Especially when it‚Äôs something damaging/disparaging about a group of people they hate/dislike.Also, to clarify, I‚Äôm not saying anyone who still believes that hates Israel. Some of them do and some are just stupid/misinformed.
It's kinda scary that people are so confidently wrong in saying that the hospital was bombed by Israel, especially when the hospital wasn't even bombed, it was the parking lot next to the hospital, and it was a malfunctioning hamas missile. People instantly run with the first thing they hear in the news (from either side), and oftentimes aren't even aware when it's disproven later on, or just don't give a shit that it was disproven.
Assuming anyone does false flags other than the west, sure, but what about the other dozen hospitals bombed and church? What about those? Also hamas?
Cool, so how about the other dozen hospitals and the one on the church that killed an American senators wife and daughter? Also‚Ä¶ what does a jihadi rocket mean? I know jihad means your struggle to defend your land, something honored in the military, but I‚Äôm curious why rockets have that badge now? Do rockets declare themselves muslim before landing?

A lot of the oligarchs in Russia are jewish, I don't know if it is significant here. Israel and Russia have had a pretty good relationship and Israel has refused to help Ukraine, weird if Russia suddenly wanted to make Israel an enemy.

Nobody understood the assignment, you all get zeros.
Are you seriously suggesting that Palestine has the bigger army with more weapons and backing much like ‚ÄúRussia wants to do in the Ukraine‚Äù. And that Palestine is the one kicking Israelis out of their homes?
&gt; &gt; Don't get me wrong, what she did is fucked up. Reposting others content with no credits and essentially making bank off of their effort is deplorable.Y'know, and the thinly veiled "Won't someone rid me of this meddlesome priest" thing by posting the guy's house.

Psht, but they are a U.S. ally, a big one. And they‚Äôre powerful military, a lot more so than most of the EU countries. Here‚Äôs evidence: ‚ÄúThe United States has vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution that would have condemned Hamas‚Äô attack on Israel while calling for a pause in the fighting to allow humanitarian assistance into Gaza.The US was the sole vote against the resolution on Wednesday, with 12 members voting in favour and Russia and the United Kingdom abstaining.‚Äù‚ÄúWe are on the ground doing the hard work of diplomacy,‚Äù US Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield told the council after the vote. ‚ÄúWe believe we need to let that diplomacy play out.‚Äùhttps://www.aljazeera.com/amp/news/2023/10/18/us-vetoes-un-resolution-calling-for-humanitarian-pause-in-israel-hamas-warhttps://youtu.be/7cQzrXA2_2E?si=LMNXh9ETUrG0KFLR
Someone should turn this into a rap track called *The Gayrus*.
Zionists are lying shites
The zionists of Israel who steal West Bank land and encourage the bombing of Palestinians are immoral lying trash
So *that* is why my friends are gay. I thought they just liked dudes.
That was my first thought. I bet people on the right are spreading this like wild-fire while telling each other that the people in charge of the place in the video are somehow "indoctrinating" their kids. Must be exhausting to believe that the world revolves around them like that.
Not one dead baby in incident
I mean it‚Äôs a little funny if you‚Äôre of the opinion that taking land in the Levant because it is part of the ancestral homeland of the Jewish people is kinda similar to what Russia wants to do in Ukraine
Yeah just like the IDF claimed there were 40 beheaded babies‚Ä¶
Free Palestine üáµüá∏
Bingo
It‚Äôs better to keep your mouth shut and appear stupid than open it and remove all doubt.
Posting 4 comments in the span of 5 minutes, jumping all over me for telling you to calm down.  You sound like a fucking psycho.  Why are you berating this person? It's funny because it's obvious propaganda, Russia and Israel are bombing civilian apartment buildings, one side is bad, the other is trying to convince us it's good.
Do what damage? Please don‚Äôt tell me you still think the hospital was leveled/destroyed.The hospital wasn‚Äôt even hit.If we can‚Äôt even clear that first hurdle, which is a simple fact, there is no point engaging with you.
Al-Jazeera disproved that. Hamas nor Islamic Jihad has rockets powerful enough to do that damage, the rocket was shot down and wouldn‚Äôt fly in that direction nor generate an explosion like that. Israel keeps changing the story, it was first Islamic Jihad, then Hamas, and also it was a Hamas base so it‚Äôs justified if it happened. This is like Turks saying the Armenian genocide didn‚Äôt happen but they also deserved it.
Wait did the teacher change his clothes or was this willingly, cause if the teacher did it I can understand the concern.
It didn‚Äôt even hit the fucking hospital you dolt.
That video was from years ago, almost as true as beheaded babies
Why? Israel isn't part of Nato
Chill out dude, no need to spaz out.  Zelensky is taking sides in this so Russia takes the obvious other side.  Israel ain't going to fight
You probably traumatized everyone involved. You shouldn‚Äôt be riding.
But (((some))) suck more than others
Looks like Chicago
The people are malnourished, lacking in water, medicine/basic healthcare. Their electricity, food, water, autonomy, and money are controlled by an aggressive military occupier that has built a cage of steel around the entire perimeter of their country, which is split in two and Israel controls the means to travel between them (highways, checkpoints etc). The occupier is the greatest abuser of human rights than any other two countries combined and has rejected more UNSC resolutions than any other UN member country. They are acting illegally by international law and hold their country through ethnic segregation of the native and/or minority population whilst using them as a source for cheap labour and target practice.What's not a concentration camp about Palestine? What illusions are you currently harbouring that you would look at that situation and not think it wasn't a concentration camp or at least a prison? Israel told Palestinian civilians to flee across the Rafah border to Egypt before they started bombing, the only way out of Gaza that Israel does not control directly. Then they bombed the Rafah crossing while mass groups of people were still trying to cross.So theres about 2+ million Palestinians, half of them children, in a steel cage controlled completely by the people that put them in that steel cage, and they are dropping bombs into said steel cage with nowhere for those people to flee to.What's the problem?

I thought Ed Harris was going to start talking
Jews are terrible people. No morals.
This isn‚Äôt confidence, this is blatant disregard for the life‚Äôs of others. You have 0 business riding
You forgot the part where Zelensky was telling everyone to go and help Israel.
Confidence? More like acting like a dumbass
Agreed. They‚Äôre the problem
Sure why not. Europeans and Jews have a way longer history of hating each other than Arabs and Jews do. If Europeans calmed tf down I‚Äôm sure Arabs and Jews can too.
Is this tanjiros mind
He chose to hijack a boeing 727 because it has retractable set of "airstairs" at the tail that can be raised and lowered from the cockpit. This feature doesn't really exist on modern commercial aircraft and the doors are designed to not be able to open while in the air due to cabin pressure.

I feel no sympathy for stupidity
Bruce Almighty shiz, right here.
I'm not asking you to give anyone the benefit of the doubt. I'm asking you to not take anything from this conflict at face value. You should do that for videos that make Israelis *or* Palestinians look bad or good. Both sides of this conflict are good as fuck at propaganda. Don't take either of them at their word. *Ever. Period.* The last time we did, everyone ended up looking dumb as hell. That's my point.
Fuck around and find out.No sympathy for fuckwits who drive like that.You hit my car with my kids in it, if the crash doesn't kill you I will.

Yeah nah. You realize that means USA vs Russia right? That's WW3
I‚Äôve seen videos of them harassing a white Roman Catholic abbot and also harassing Armenian Christians. While being likely makes it worse, I think they‚Äôll just assault anyone who believe in their bullshit. I‚Äôve even seen Israeli police attack pro-Palestinian Jews.
Do you really believe that could be possible? Because I have doubts.
Probably because he thinks he is documenting evidence of them trying to "trans his kid".

The israelis would prefer if the arab christians and Muslims would just vacate Jerusalem. It'd spare them the inconvenience of slow ethnic cleansing
American Christians: üôÇ
I love propaganda by the west because the US doesn‚Äôt want to admit a bomb they gave Israel was used to destroy a hospital!
It‚Äôs always so crazy to see where drunk people end up. Oh the places you‚Äôll go.
But I don't get it. I've only ever done good in my life yet someone who kills people but calls themselves Christian is "chosen"...?
Religious beliefs and sexuality repression are not mutually exclusive.
And the evidence shows that was a lie![gif](giphy|VfwJk8Uu9HYHK)
You mean Ukraine
When it comes from more than one official account at the same time and then be deleted? It‚Äôs def an evidence. And the person you are talking about does not take the news from twitter or somewhere else, he is the one who announces it. You guys are acting blind from what it is clear. WAKE UP.
Great father
The adults need to reject Hamas. If they are contributing to a terror group that only ever engages in conflict knowing the outcome will lead to further violence against them they can't say they are 100% blameless.They should have been condemning it for the sake of their children. Even if they didn't take to the streets to protest I have not heard an outcry against the mess Hamas started. There is an option of trying to oust Hamas and since nobody is talking about that what does it say? Just because half the population is kids doesn't mean there are no options. This is the one thing that is hanging me up. Yes Israel is ultimately responsible for this but what is supposed to happen now? The only option at this point is the end of Hamas. The sooner and smoother that happens the more likely it is that the Palestinians will get what they want. If this isn't the path that is being pursued then what do they expect to happen?
Man ain't that the truth. Half the shit that happens on the road we're done after someone thought "nah I got this".
Damn bro i felt that last bit hard
Religions are like genitalia. Better to keep them hidden inside your pants and not exposed to others. It‚Äôs always offensive to some else‚Äôs religion. In fact it should be taken as more inappropriate than exposing one‚Äôs genitalia uninvited
Gorgeous YouTuber that became popular doing Let's Plays of CoD and Fortnite, but it turned out she had someone else playing and she would just comment over it. She moved to react content next and would just repeat whatever the meme was without adding anything to the conversation. She also was arrested for assault and armed robbery. Bunch of other YouTubers started commenting on the allegations and evidence, one of them being JacksFilms. He really started laying into her and the allegations and continued to create content around how fake she was and she got mad, livestreamed on Instagram from outside his house and showed her millions of followers where JacksFilms lives. Many were calling upon YouTube to do something about it and all they did was demonetize her new videos while allowing her to collect money on what is essentially stolen content with a facecam of her in the corner.Don't get me wrong, what she did is fucked up. Reposting others content with no credits and essentially making bank off of their effort is deplorable. But she is very good looking, just an awful person.

I had a Dad like this. Told me not to wave a specific way because real men don‚Äôt wave like that. All that shit did was make me feel unnecessarily self conscious about something completely stupid.
At this point Israel has killed off so many adults of Palestine that 50% of the population of Gaza are children. The average age is 18. You're asking children to rise up against Hamas?

Sounds like an awesome dad.
Lucky you didn't kill someone else.
Fringe my ass, we have politicians in the US that believe this. I'm amazed at how many people downplay the wide spread of Evangelical Christians in the US especially in our government. Hell my colleagues that are in the air force pointed out that a lot of people that move up the ranks need to be God fearing Christians and quite a significant chunk of those joining the military from the Bible colleges gravitate towards the air force. And just so people don't say I'm talking out of my ass:https://www.npr.org/2005/06/02/4676698/air-force-academy-embroiled-in-religious-controversy
I'm down with that, thanks.
Wait so Israel isn't predominantly Christian? What am I missing here?
Yep
Where is this?
Lol, what a bot
True, Hamas is probably a better source of information /s
Damm nice beat bad message (fuck Palestine (mainly Gaza(double fuck Hamas though)))
This is exactly my point. People want to argue about colonize vs settlement vs power. At the end of the day lets stop fighting a language/semantics war over a geopolitical/state conflict. What are the borders people want? What rights do they want? What are the actionable steps to get towards those solutions? Or are we just keeping with the oppression narrative because the oppression narrative will just justify the violence against an oppressor? If that is the case it is no better than people criticizing Israel over genocidal intent in their dehumanizing and nazi-ism narrative to justify their violence against the Palestinians.Basically we need to cut the crap of putting fancy arguments over the top of the us and them narratives because those are two sides of the same coin. A real solutions that could result in peace (if it is possible anymore) will be made independent of that us and them rhetoric.
Do you know what literal means?
Lol Israel would roll over Russia.
You got to love people who don't know anything and yet pretend to know everything, to try and impress people by trying to sound smart. All they end up doing is looking stupid.
Hes lucky he didn‚Äôt fucking kill anyone. This kind of shit should be grounds for permanent license suspension. No one doing this should be on the road, ever.

Not an ounce of resistance to their questions. Just singing away

Finally, to add further vinegar to your wounds from your intellectual thrashing, here is my objective evidence that Palestinian Christians are not only treated the same as Muslims, but oppose Israel and are aligned with Muslims. https://remix.aljazeera.com/aje/PalestineRemix/phone/forbidden-pilgrimage.htmlhttps://www.newarab.com/analysis/how-palestinian-christians-are-being-driven-out-jerusalem?amphttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-israel-religion/we-are-one-palestinian-christians-and-muslims-unite-against-trumps-jerusalem-call-idUSKBN1E61SBhttps://imeu.org/article/palestinian-christians-in-the-holy-landhttps://www.middleeasteye.net/news/israel-palestine-christianity-proposed-bill-conversion-latest-target

Thank you for acknowledging your defeat and being the unfortunate recipient of an intellectual thrashing. I systematically deconstructed and obliterated every one of your inaccurate opinions. If I'm incorrect, you should be capable of also deconstructing and annihilating my thesis. But, you can't, which means you know less than I.I can cite my credentials because, unlike you, I possess them.
Sure chief
Yup, that's what I thought
Friend of mine grew up with a dad who taught him about fixing cars (he's still a car buff), hunting, fishing, sports and all of the usual "manly" things. He came out as gay when he was 15 and his dad said he had known for years and was supportive. When his dad first met his boyfriend that would become his husband he asked him if he liked to hunt, fish, sports etc and he said no, said his dad never showed him (and disowned him). All my friend's dad said, "Well if you ever want to learn, I'll show you.". My friend credits his dad will passing on a ton of useful knowledge. As he says I'll likely never be lost in the woods to a point I need to hunt for food, but I know how if I need to.
Once again, you're speaking on issues in which you know absolutely nothing about. Azerbaijan and Karabakh are NOT Arab territories, nor claimed by Arab nations. Perhaps, you're mistaking Turkey with the MENA Region, which in geopolical knowledge is equivalent to preschool. Equating African nations to Palestine is absurd:1.  If I'm understanding you completely, you wouldn't take issue with someone either occupying your country, nor someone coming to your property, violently kicking you out of your house, taking over your home, and slaughtering your family? But, let me guess, "That's different" (somehow)?2.  African nations DID revolt and participate in anticolonialism. Therefore, that anecdote is not only patently false and has zero salience. Hell, in the 21st Century, South Sudan seceded from [Northern] Sudan.3.  African nations are self-governing, independent, and not under occupation. The international community recognized Israel as an occupying body. Israel has continuously illegally expanded its borders and violated every aspect of international law, including the Geneva Conventions. Which, by the way, prohibits occupation, but allows and affords protections for armed resistance to occupiers.4.  When Israel was created, it was by UN Resolution contrary to previously agreements between Western Powers and Arabs. Thus, the Israeli state's existence does not contravene international law (despite still being immoral). However, their continued expansion in stealing additional land and engaging in genocides against  Palestinians is against international law and norms.5.  If it's a religious conflict then Palestinian Christians and Muslims would be fighting amongst one another. Instead, they have united against Israel.  The founding Zionists were primarily atheists and agnostics, and founded Israel as a homeland for ethnic Jews, not religious practice. This conflict is primarily predicated upon ethnic and nationalistic demarcations, which religion happens to be a secondary motivation. You are out of your depth in this discourse, and you should bear in mind that speaking from opinions is nothing except lying.
WELL THEN IT MUST BE TRUE! üôÑYou could have just said you have zero interest in the truth. It would have been easier to type.
Same here haha. Somewhere my mom has a bunch of pictures of me at like 7 years old wearing various dresses and posing for a fashion show with my sister. I'm sure she's saving those for my wedding.
Fuck israel
Too bad Zionist Isreal doesn't exist. People like you saying dumb shit like this just screams idiocy and ignorance. You're just running around spewing the same garbage you got from tiktok or Instagram. You probably grew up with the internet and still don't understand that you're not supposed to believe the majority of the shit you see.
From the video's description:&gt; Israeli police broke into the prayer room at the mosque in East Jerusalem as several hundred Palestinians stayed on after Friday prayers to protest against potential evictions of Palestinians from homes on land claimed by Jewish settlers. At least 178 Palestinians and six officers were injured in the night-time clashes at Islam's third-holiest site and around East Jerusalem&gt; This video is _not_ the truthIt is. You can't make fake videos this good yet. You can't lie about it. You're literally watching it with your own eyes. I'm not sure if you've only started hearing about Israel two weeks ago, but they made a reputation for themselves regarding harassing people during prayers or in their holy places of worship.
I do trust the guardian as a news source. What i don't trust are videos from the exact moment required to frame a narrative and then someone trying to "explain" what happened leading up to it, ie, creating a narrative. This video is *not* the truth. This is part of the story. The whole story would include what led up to this.
‚ÄúThis looks right on brand‚Ä¶ do better‚Äù Do better than discriminating because you‚Äôve had a bad time. I‚Äôve experienced more violence at the hands of Mexicans than anyone else, I don‚Äôt go around the internet spreading bs about Mexicans.
Obviously it's SSSnifferWolf reposting content and claiming to be the sole creator and then getting mad when called out for it.
Not too sound too much like George Takei but that should read ‚ÄúPalestinian-Americans‚Äù right? For the obvious reasons that we all know.
Used to work in daycare. This does happen
So not even a video from the guardian does it for you, huh? Some strong mental gymnastics you have there for expecting people to film before altercations start.People are really just going about their day when Israeli forces decide to fuck up their days. That is why people want to be free from Israel.&gt; Videos like these are what Hamas uses to garner sympathy from the West.Videos like these are the truth. The truth is uncomfortable and it doesn't care about what you think and who it serves.
It‚Äôs a lost cause to try to speak any facts here. Look at OP‚Äôs page. This is like an Active Measures circle jerk.
Sigh.. Yet another video showing the altercation and nothing leading up to it.Not saying it was or wasn't warranted, just there's no way to tell because the video only shows the altercation and not what led to it. Videos like these are what Hamas uses to garner sympathy from the West.
This is my conclusion. Both sides of this have been in the wrong in different ways going back nearly 100 years. Isreal has been oppressing the Palestinians and the Palestinians chose a terror group to govern them that was in part created by Isreal itself as an excuse to attack them. There is plenty of blame to go around and nearly impossible to know how this will end.
Damn. It‚Äôs almost like arbitrary gender norms invented within the past century are completely meaningless. Crazy
I didn‚Äôt know China and Israel were friends?
Saw clip from one hanging, they didn't even allow a drop to break the neck but they slowly raised raised them with a excavator. The asphyxiation and resulting cramping made their backs arch backwards before they lost their conciousness and died.Their only crime being a non-hetero. LGBTQ+ defending them is sooo delusional and weird.
Oof again. Just going through your comment history shows how insufferable you are. Nearly every comment you write starts with you talking about the qualifications you claim to have, but nothing you say reflects the knowledge someone with those qualifications would know or say. You're just another pro-Hamas bot masquerading as some intellectual subject matter expert. Not worth my time.
Sigh..[here's](https://youtu.be/P1pt40ZelgM?si=RhD2Xt7KMg0wHt0J) another one from inside the mosque.
I would loooooooove to see Israel attack Russia and then get royally fucked up for it. Nobody fucks with Russia.
There's a picture of me when I was 13 wearing a dress, wig, glasses and stuffed my feet into some high heels and holding a baby. Why? My female cousin who was the same age said I should act like Mrs. Doubtfire, so I did. Guess what? Well first we laughed a bunch, then my grandma snapped a picture of us laughing and I still turned out straight. My sister and I played with her Barbies and her Polly Pockets and she played with my Tonka Trucks and Ghostbusters. We are both straight. Every single guy I know who had a little sister or even old sister, or even cousins for that matter played with girl's toys and vice versa and there's nothing wrong with that.I've always found these toxic masculine clowns always have to make it known how manly they are and their boy doing anything feminine is a knock at their manliness.I feel horrible for this kid because if he comes out as gay his shit bag dad will likely treat him like shit and disown him.
My aunt rode horses, slaughtered pigs, and occasionally shot a rifle at her running away drunk husband (who had just gotten into a temper tantrum)She was plenty womanly in all sorts of ways. Her daughters had unicorn ü¶Ñ posters up on their bedroom walls. We all weaved dream catchers and crafted bracelets and other hanging door signs before going out to do farm work, play on the tractor, ride horses and race the ATV. My aunt and grandpa both taught us all how to shoot. In addition to other animal consuming related practices. All the girls played with all the boys in the family when the parents wanted peace and quiet. All of our toys were in the same area. And of course we all played dress up together‚Äîmostly being girls costumes. How did a dress üëó change the fact we were horse riding gun toting lasses and lads?
My 7 year-old daughter likes to dress my 4 year-old son up in her Halloween costume dresses. Their grandfather hates it and doesn‚Äôt find it very funny. Oh well ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. Get over it gramps!
Well of course I do lol
Not sure where this was but here in Canada, it is super illegal.
Nahhh man my intentions wasn‚Äôt to make you feel stupid lol it is common sense if you really think about, but nobody really ever does Think about it. There is no reason too because most of us just see them as a vehicle on the road. The only reason I know this info is because my brother drives semi‚Äôs for a reason. I really never thought about how dangerous it was until he explained it to me. Stay safe out there my man!
Sick individuals.  pure evil.   I hope Israel rolls heavy and cleans house.
Nobody is going for the gun that is freely around the guy‚Äôs shoulder so not too shabby of a tussle.
Wife is a teacher for 5 ~6 years old and after showing her this video she said there are boys that demand the teacher to dress them like princess.
How do you know these people were just praying before being "harassed"? The video only shows the part after, not what led up to the altercation
Reads like a cumtown commentEdit: also I'm gay
Right on. It‚Äôs all made up anyways. My lil guy mostly just likes fucking shit up in a non-gendered way.
And know this: know that everything‚Äôs cool. And yes I will be present on the first day of school - and grad -u-a-tionnn
No, you‚Äôre absolutely right. I don‚Äôt know shit about semis. But every thing you said made me feel like this should be common sense. Lmao. My bad and thank you.
Let me guess you have an older sister....
I figured we all would have learned not to just accept things at face value anymore, especially after the past couple weeks. And especially regarding the parties involved in this conflict.
There is no future where Palestine will ever beat Israel in a military conflict. Israel has the ability to fight six different countries at the same time by itself. With support from the United States, it's basically unbeatable in that region.Palestine has a nation is not going to ever exist, at least not in any capacity you think. The best case scenario is that one very progressive Israeli government arises and allows Palestine to have a state, that is essentially defanged and demilitarized. Even then such a deal would only be made with a very progressive Palestinian leader as well.That's not likely to happen this generation though. Both Palestine and Israel have shifted further to the right and support for reconciliation is at an all time low.
I'm not pro Israel. I acknowledge what they are doing and have done. How are Palestinians supporting Hamas though when they completely derailed any chance for peace during the Oslo accord? Hamas has up until recently said they will only ever accept nothing less than the complete destruction of Israel and that's part of how it's gotten so bad. My heart hurts for all those caught in this but when a majority supports a terror group are they not contributing to the problem? I feel their needs to be an acknowledgment that the existence of Hamas has only ever made things worse. If Palestinians want peace they can't choose a terror group to be their leaders. While Netanyahu might have supported Hamas the Palestinians very much had a hand in their rise to power. If civilians turned on Hamas and ousted them from power this would all be a very different scenario would it not? Not that it should be the job of everyday people to do such a thing, but it's costing them thousands of lives not to. They'd rather let Hamas hide behind them knowing it will result in innocent deaths.
The assumption on ‚Äúcontext‚Äù of this video truly is astounding. Thank you for being a beacon of hope in this world of utter insanity.
Then, disprove it. Obviously, you receive your brainwashing from biased media?Unlike you, I have academic, practical, and professional expertise. I'm a Middle East Political Scientist, received a dual Masters degree (Middle Eastern Studies and Political Science-International Relations-Middle East Politics), was a graduate teaching assistant to a former UN Chief Negotiator of the Palestinian-Israeli Conflict, traveled throughout the MENA Region (including Palestine), lived in the region, and worked for a human rights organization in Palestine. So, what are your qualifications to speak on the matter? I NEVER speak on any issue unless I've conducted objective and empirical research on the discourse and can provide that objective data as support.Perhaps, you should obtain my sense of intelligence and morality by avoiding to speak on issues which you have not performed objective and empirical research, as well. But, then you'd never be able to speak at all.
Isn‚Äôt this from 2018?
It‚Äôs funny because they didn‚Äôt even mention ‚ÄúArab‚Äù yet you seem to think they did.
I dont mean to be that guy, but this is a random blurry video with zero context besides a title made by a random redditor. Worse than that, it was released amidst perhaps the largest misinformation campaign between two entities that we've seen in modern history, and you are comfortable accepting whatever you've been told about it by a random guy on the internet lol. Do better.
If some people are God‚Äôs chosen people, does that mean others aren‚Äôt? So are they condemned to hell?
"I'm black, I can't be racist"  Ugg.
What is this evidence of exactly? It's a random blurry video with zero context besides a title made by a random redditor. Worse than that, it was released amidst perhaps the largest misinformation campaign between two entities that we've seen in modern history, and you are comfortable accepting whatever you've been told about it by a random guy on the internet lol.
It could also be religious beliefs.
Im soooooo happy for not having a religion, shit's a cult all aroundI wish health and freedom to palestine
I know a guy who believes this stuff. It‚Äôs not about being born like that, it‚Äôs being allowed to play with feminine things. He‚Äôs very anti-gay. He has two young boys, one who wants longer hair, loves sparkles, plays girls characters in games. I feel so bad for that kid because he‚Äôs just going to get shit from his dad (and has - which I‚Äôve stepped in on). ‚òπÔ∏è
Fuck ~~Arab~~ all terrorists.  There, I fixed it for you.
I'm just going to say, this isn't just individual pieces of shit actions. The Israeli forces is literally enabling it. Can you not see them?About the video being cut, I don't have an answer. A lot of people only pull out their phones when they're something to film, like an actual incident. It could be just that. Answer me this, where in the world is it ok to harass people praying? Not matter their religion.
Helping Russian oligarchs hide their yachts, planes, and money really paid off for Israel.
Only the protestants, Catholics and Orthodox aren't Zionist
Religion is poisonous nonsense.
Yes yes very good, you found two stories about individual pieces of shit, which means you now have a green light to go full anti semitism. That doesn't negate the fact that most videos of Israeli soldiers engaging with Palestinians are always cut to the moment after the provocation by the Palestinian and presented as though some evil, blood thirsty Israeli soldiers were out huntin' little poor innocent Palestinians.It's like, the first thing in their propaganda playbook. Show me the two minutes leading up to any incident and let's see what really happened.
Wiping out an entire nation, which at this point is clearly the goal of Israel, is defined as genocide. They have been systematically uprooting,  segregating, using apartheid tactics to eliminate Palestine. But you're okay with genocide as long as it's "nice genocide"? And reminder, hamas was still funded and supported by Israel to create this situation.
Oof that is so much misinformation in one copy pasta. Did you lift this from hamas.com?
Sad thing is I can totally relate to this except it was my grandmother who punished me when I was 4 for wearing an apron like a dress swatting me on the legs as she tore the apron off of me

What happened in the cartoon boxes before the first one in this comic? I know it's hard, but try and see the bigger context and history. This cartoon is literally how a 12 year old would understand the issue lol.
Probably put it on Facebook with a rant in all caps warning parents against booking this daycare center
I hate that this kid obviously feels safe and cared for by his teachers but obviously won't anymore because he'll be worried they'll get in trouble for him, or could get him into trouble. Every part of this is fucked up, this dad would be my enemy if I worked there.
The Hang (German pronunciation: \[ha≈ã\]; plural form: Hanghang) is a type of musical instrument called a handpan, fitting into the idiophone class and based on the Caribbean steelpan instrument. It was created by Felix Rohner and Sabina Sch√§rer in Bern, Switzerland.https://preview.redd.it/l109bpi538wb1.jpeg?width=1874&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8e1eed1fa8e1a36935fdb8f802a8dfdbd5535556Here‚Äôs the inventors of the handpan

There are some fundamentalist ‚ÄúChristian‚Äù denominations that view the Old Testament, specifically, as being written by God, and everything in it is 100% accurate, true, and must be followed 100%. And anything short of that is blasphemy.A lot of the recently-invented fundie churches operate this way. Little/no emphasis on the Gospel‚Ä¶ all emphasis on the Old Testament. Treating it all literally and not as additional context for the New Testament and the teachings of Christ.But that‚Äôs not, historically, how Christianity operates. That‚Äôs not how mainstream Christianity operates. e.g. Catholic, Lutheran, Episcopalian, Methodist, Presbyterian, etc‚Ä¶The mainline-traditional Christian churches are not fundamentalist.The notion that all the Jews in the world must be centralized in Israel so that the apocalypse can happen is - absolutely - limited to fundie/weirdo pseudo-Christian schools of religious thought.

This shit real or what? Where is this place? I guess gotta go there before my death lol
Your entire take is based on the completely absurd assumption that Hamas will be the singular post-zionist political entity. Nevermind that more than half of Palestinians don't live under their jurisdiction, there hasn't been an election in Gaza since 2006, and there is no reason to believe that all Palestinians are or will be united around a single party should the occupation end. Secularism and leftism are still strong tendencies in their politics. &gt; So, you, who supports Palestine, doesn't want a conference to arrange peace, doesn't believe in a two state solution, and believes that an Islamic caliphate should be erected across mesopotamia, after the "obliteration of Israel."&gt; you see why people question Hamas supporters?Completely unhinged and wild assumptions you're making about me, a secular Jew. All it took was for me to say that you're wrong about a caliphate automatically taking the place of Israel for you to launch into this ridiculous rant. I never said I supported Hamas. Buddy, anyone can go and read what the founders of Zionism and Israel said about "coexistence". Namely, that they had absolutely no intention of doing it. They were abundantly clear in their intention to dispossess Palestinians because they saw them the same way that European colonizers saw Indigenous peoples - as inferior beings. Give me a fucking break lol.

One thing I try to break down as a parent of 3 daughters is dumb gender norms, but I don't force it; I let my kids be themselves and be interested in the things they want to be interested in. My oldest Daughter who is 6 loves to mimic what I do; She loves to watch Football and Star Wars with me because she knows I like it, she helps me when I'm using power tools to install or build something, wants to help me with mowing the lawn and changing the oil on my car/moped, and I am more than happy to teach her or just have her just hang out with me while I do it because I'm just happy she wants to spend time with me.My Middle Daughter who is 4 is all about dresses, princesses, Barbies, you name it. But she's more than happy to help me cook breakfast on the weekends for the family. She's all about food and snuggling on the couch while watching old Disney movies, and I'm happy to spend that time with her.My youngest daughter just turned 2, and I'm not sure what she's into yet, she's just happy to tag along with whatever me or my wife is doing and just happy to be a part of it. Usually we just watch Bluey and she climbs on me like a big jungle gym.Just let your kids be kids, they'll figure things out as they grow.
If it was being done by committing acts like rape, torture and the slaughter of babies I wouldn't support them. To win the war (which by taking this route assures failure and demonization for your cause) and lose your humanity that's just too high a cost. Granted Isreal is also committing henious acts of violence in retaliation but it's on the heels of finding children burnt alive and bodies mutilated and not as collateral damage but purposefully.
Kind of both and neither. Jesus didn‚Äôt come to come to start or merge any religion. He came to ‚Äúsave‚Äù both Jews and Gentiles alike as they were/are all sinners. He was really anti religion as he constantly sparred with the Pharisees who were the religious leaders of his time.
Hahaha bro came in here swinging good for him
How about you now, Christians?
What the fuck am I doing with my life?
I have spent time in Palestine and know many Palestinian Christians. A constant question I'm asked is, "Why do American Christians support Israel in oppressing us? Israel treats us just like they treat Palestinian Muslims. In Israeli's eyes, there aren't Christians and Muslims, just Palestinian  dogs" (kalb or "dog" is the lowest insult other than donkey).I tell them, "it's due to gross ignorance of the region and conflict. But, even if it was brought to their attention, they are so inhumane, brainwashed, and ignorant that it wouldn't matter to them."In response, they said, "They aren't Christians. Muslims are more of our brothers than American Christians. Just as we led the resistance against Israeli occupation, Muslims now fight with and for us." Besides utter ignorance, or due to it, American Christians misconstrue this as a religious conflict. When, in reality, it's about retaining their ancestral lands. Yes, Palestinians have been there longer than today's Israeli Jews, with whom 96% are European immigrants. Moreover, genetic studies find that many Palestinians are descendants of the indigenous inhabitants that preceded the Jewish arrival and genocides the Jews perpetrated against them, or are Jews who converted to Christianity and Islam.Americans supporting Jewish rights to return due to being their so-called "ancestral homeland" must also accept and support Mexican immigration since most of the Southwestern US used to belong to Mexico. By your logic, Mexicans also have a right to return to the US. Hypocrites!

You‚Äôve only further proven my point by continuing to demonstrate that you don‚Äôt have the emotional bandwidth to see the perspective of others. Everyone‚Äôs approach to grief must strictly adhere to your own because that‚Äôs the only way you know to navigate the world. It‚Äôs born out of some pretty aggressive ignorance and entitlement.
Most Jews of Jesus‚Äôs time did not believe that he was the Messiah. That‚Äôs why they turned him over to Pontius Pilate to be crucified.
This sort of shit just taught me to not share who I am with my parents from an early age.
Russia, Ukraine, Canada, and European countries all have them, and don't forget our precious KKK üòâ   Israel is just following their footsteps for funsies.
Outside of the reddit hivemind, it's a totally normal reaction
I did the same thing when I was a small child. To this day I am a cis straight male. Because wearing a certain article of clothing has no effect on gender or sexual orientation, and it has no effect on how anyone develops. The way this father is acting might certainly effect the development of the child though.
What is this from üòÇ
Mostly the Zionist, plenty of anti Zionist Jews that hate what they‚Äôve been doing with the country since the beginning of the establishment of Israel
For a second there, I thought you didn‚Äôt know how abbreviations worked lol
So Christians are also mistreated by Israel? I wonder why they don't do kaboom ü§î
Russia has a lot of actual Nazis, they do marches and parades there, there is quite a lot of prejudice there in case people are unaware.
I agree with both of you
So can I ask you a question? Why did people claim 500 or more were killed right away, even though it would not have been possible to know so soon? Why did they say the hospital was levelled while reporting from inside the hospital, when you could go on Google Earth and other sources at the very site showed, with live video, that it hit the parking lot, and left a pothole? Bc I believed like you did, but thought it was odd they could say so quickly the numbers, and then kept seeing other falsehoods (hospital was not levelled, there were not 500 killed, etc.) which signifies to me a liar, bc why would they need to embellish in such a ridiculous way? I saw the videos and analyses of arms experts on the rocket, saw it malfunction in the air, it was quite clear what happened. Maybe the truth doesn't matter to you, and I agree Israel has gone overboard and we need a cease fire, but sorry to tell you that the truth matters a HELLUVA lot to many of us out  here. When people lie, they don't win friends and supporters on the side of justice. The truth matters.
Here's another [story](https://youtube.com/shorts/v2w14c3wXlU?si=qXDA4uChTaF33aeu) from April. And [another](https://youtu.be/lq28ZFNzaWM?si=Zgg3GB08ZY0tp7Dl) where you can see the IDF standing by the di*kface.
That's because those Christians don't look like the "right kind" of Christian.
I pray so much about it need some knee, padsIt happened for a reason one can't be, mad
‚Ä¶still in quotes.
Hey! What‚Äôs your name?!
One big difference is starting soon, and that is a full ground campaign, that has not happened since the 2008 Gaza War. ALSO started when Israel was attacked. But this time, they will clean out the whole strip for any Hamas members.
Russia does have a lot of Nazis and does support Hamas, already there are tons of bots hired to spread their social media shit on Twitter. Nazis and Hamas have similar goals, for now. And Putin and Wagner and Erik Prince helps train some of these terrorists. So, I get why he lost his temper. Russia was very happy to help and support Hamas to distract from their war crimes. But much of the world is still watching what Russia is doing and has done, we will not forget.
No it isn't. Look up the Hamas Charter."The charter states that "our struggle against the Jews is very great and very serious" and calls for the eventual creation of an Islamic state in Palestine, in place of Israel and the Palestinian Territories,[3] and the obliteration or dissolution of Israel.[4][5] It emphasizes the importance of jihad, stating in article 13, "There is no solution for the Palestinian question except through Jihad. Initiatives, proposals and international conferences are all a waste of time and vain endeavors."[6] The charter also states that Hamas is humanistic, and tolerant of other religions as long as they "stop disputing the sovereignty of Islam in this region".[7]"So, you, who supports Palestine, doesn't want a conference to arrange peace, doesn't believe in a two state solution, and believes that an Islamic caliphate should be erected across mesopotamia, after the "obliteration of Israel."Got it. You see why people question Hamas supporters? Because they support a group that is analogous to the Taliban, to Isis, to Hezbollah, and to other extremely Conservative religious extremist groups that go against just about every Liberal tenant in existence.And you wonder why people don't support the cause of people who's stated goals are genocide and destruction?In a region of the Earth that was Jewish, then thousands of years later experienced an emigration and conquering by Islam, you support the idea that all other religious people should bow down to the sovereignty of Islam across the holy land, despite their own cultures and religions dating back to before the Prophet Muhammed pbuh was even born?That is absolutely fucking silly to anyone with a brain, and that is why the default assumption is that supporting Palestine simply means the person didn't do enough research, or hates Jews. Because what other conclusion could a reasonable person reach? I'm not saying to support Israel. But damn if you are going to make a foreign conflict part of your identity, supporting those who dissuade peace and prefer genocide makes you nearly as bad.Anyone who grew up in Ireland knows this. No matter how much one might hate unionists and the English, it is not worth sacrificing the prosperity of your children for the sake of being correct in a burning land.Now Ireland is the richest country in Europe by many metrics, and Palestine literally doesn't exist as a recognised nation state, despite having multiple opportunities over the past 70 years.If the Palestinian leader had accepted statehood in the year 2000, none of today's events would be occurring. But they didn't "come to their senses" until the late 2000s, and by then any good faith solution had run its course.At some point, the moral thing to do is not what the rich leader thinks is right, it is what enables people to live in a self determined state. And time and time again, the Palestinian leadership have completely rejected this in favour of continued conflict and war.Ask yourself, why did Egypt, a country that once invaded Israel in order to exterminate Jews from the Islamic holy land, warn Israel 3 days prior to the HAMAS attack?Why are the only countries that support HAMAS currently and actively Iran and Lebanon? Because they are also nations aligned with Shariah principles, such as women being murdered for not wearing appropriate clothing.Notice that none of what I've said supports Israel. It simply attempts to break down the fallacy of a Palestine that actually wants peace, or a cohabiting solution with Israel.
It‚Äôs the whole ‚Äúthey‚Äôre corrupting our children‚Äù gimmick of theirs. They want to have the other idiots of the internet gather up in arms over how he‚Äôs ‚Äústanding up‚Äù for his son. It‚Äôs not gonna be a surprise if he‚Äôs an asshole and his kid wants nothing to do with him in the future, while he cries that no one loves him.
100% the father has had some feelings he's repressing. It's always projection.
Once again, an Internet video presented without context to frame the narrative perfectly.Show the two minutes or so leading up to this and it's likely a completely different story
And Hamas and other groups are STILL shooting rockets towards Israel, Libanon even joined, and the Palestinian people are dying in the streets instead of aiding their own people, Hamas members rather die than help Palestinians.
Years later: "Why don't I have any grandkids?!"
I was raised in a conservative Christian home, although one that truly was more about loving others than condemning them. I always liked knights and soldiers and dinosaurs and stuff. Was never a fan of race cars. So when McDonald‚Äôs did their Barbie or nascar toy I always asked my parents for the Barbie. And they were always fine with it. My logic was I wanted my knights and soldiers could have wives. But I don‚Äôt think my parents knew, they were just cool with it probably because they knew I had a fun, wild imagination. I‚Äôm just saying that I am grateful I had parents that albeit strict with various things, overall we‚Äôre caring and loving and lenient in ways many conservative parents aren‚Äôt.
Perhaps the world is flat?!

The only outcome is the shame his son feels for innocently playing. What a sack of fucking shit. How fragile does he think our personalities are that it's influenced by a piece of clothing.I don't know how many times our boys ended up with pink hand-me-down sneakers or snow pants and girls with camo or Nascar.

Opposite for me in that I LOVED Polly Pockets growing up and my Aunt, cousins and sister would dress me up as a girl when I was a toddler. I'm straight so I don't think this stuff really matters. People like what they like. Exposing them to things the other sex does or dressing up as the other sex is not a big deal.
It won‚Äôt happen again, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever, ever again‚Ä¶
My older sisters dressed me like that when I was younger. I'm a proud gay man now because of it because that's what this parent thinks happens.I am gay though

I know right?!? Dad had just given me the ‚Äúman talk‚Äù about how ‚Äúno means try harder‚Äù, ‚Äúthis is how you hit on the kids‚Äô teacher without mom finding out‚Äù, and ‚Äúwaitresses laugh at your jokes because they want sex‚Äù.

If my dad had been a specimen of virility like this guy I‚Äôd be a gym rat, pumped up on T, offering dick pics to each and every woman there.
It sounds like you don‚Äôt know much about semi‚Äôs, which is totally normal. Mostly everyone knows little about them. But they are huge pieces of mass (a truck driving an empty trailer weighs almost 18tons. A fully loaded trailer can weigh up to 40 tons) driving 60+ mph. It takes a good amount of energy and time for that truck to slow down. In a situation like this, the driver of the semi was probably shitting his pants knowing how fucked the whole situation is. He could have killed the biker and there was nothing he could do about it.

&gt; His comments are in quotes, so I‚Äôm guessing he get the comments from the person that was actually in the video.This is reddit, where the most blatant, over-the-top sarcasm needs to be posted with a /s, and satire/rage bait regularly gets upvoted to the front page on the basis that it's real.EDIT: I just checked, and it looks like OP clarified in the comments that they are not the person in this video and got downvoted, thus helping to propagate the misinformation that it is. The fucking dumbasses on this site, I swear...
Yeah, just because that shit is in the bible  doesn't mean that anybody actually believes it.
Poor kid's gender identity isn't impressionable. But his self-esteem sure as hell is. Dad just shamed him publicly and all the little guy learned is he shouldn't trust his own choices.

I youtubed easy song or every goddamn variation and it never gave me this song as an option, thanks for posting it!
There is no need to record though, and also scare other children in the mix. Ask to speak to the teacher in the hall about vs being a public asshole about it. Those other children looked legit terrified.
The hospital strike claim was a lie though. Hamas errantly hit the hospital and then blamed Israel. This has been confirmed.
No shit. Go on YouTube and look at all the bike channels. They all ride like this, yet it's the other people on the road that are always at fault when something happens.
Dumbass, if you're going to steal an already existing crash video and claim it as your own, at least be smart about it and use one that doesn't already have tens of thousands of views

Also Arab Christians do say this as well as many other Arabic phrases such as Alhamdulillah, Masha Allah, Hafithak Allah, and Ya Allah.

American conservatives don‚Äôt care about Christianity when Christians are attacked in the Holy Land.

Because he doesn't actually care about his child, all he cares about is his own dumb ass morals.
It doesn't make him fragile. It makes him a father who doesn't want his young son in a dress.
This is a fringe belief. Just to be clear.
In 75 years Israel has taken like 95% (by looking at the maps) from Palestine. They continue building settlements in Palestinian land, pushing Palestinians out, then when people protest and retaliate for the theft they claim to be justified in then officials expanding their territory there to fight off the violence. Would you support the people fighting against the invaders who have taken 95% of your country?
Bro wants his bike to rust

I don't really know the story myself, but something tells me it wasn't incredibly thought out
Lack of intelligence &amp; lack of respect
That's Religion for you.
&gt;  "yeah I did a lot of drugs and alcohol but Jesus turned my life around." Okay so all you're doing is showing kids you can survive being an idiot and in the moment, that's all they care aboutWait, you upset they said they used to be a drug abuser? You want drug abuse to be hidden under the carpet, because surely no one will get into drugs then if they don't hear from all the silly former addicts?
Guess that's where his arms got mangled unless it was the first impact.Can't believe he stayed on the bike initially, that's a new one for me.  Next time needs to make sure he lands softly in the bed of the pickup that he rear-ends.

So Christianity will be merge to Judaism? Or other way around . ?
If there was any brain in there it is likely sitting in that truck bed now.
Nikki Nikki can‚Äôt you seeThey just hate the IsraeliNikki Nikki hear the newsWe say Zionist instead of JewsNikki Nikki we hate ZionistBecause that way we don‚Äôt sound fascist
Jesus was supposedly Jewish. Jews are supposedly God's chosen people. So no they prob wouldn't convert
![gif](giphy|l3q2K5jinAlChoCLS)
Question : what happen to the jews on that time ? Do they gone follow Jesus , I.e. convert to Christianity?
Ever, ever?Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
To me, personally, it's the same as not wanting your kid to be dirty, or not wanting your kid to run the streets at all hours of the night. People can parent however the fuck they want to as long it's not abuse and not wanting your kid in a dress IS NOT ABUSE AND IS COMPLETELY ACCEPTABLE. NEWSFLASH EVERYONE--WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT AND CHOOSE TO PARENT OUR KIDS IN DIFFERENT WAYS.
THOUGHTS OF WE THOUGHTS OF SHE
All bible believing christians are zionists.                           They believe that Jesus was the Jewish messiah (*christ*), that was predicted in the Jewish scriptures (*old testament*), and that one day the Jews will return to Israel and then the anti-christ will come, and then he will be defeated, and then Jesus will return and rule the world from Jerusalem in Israel.
I love this! My son likes more "feminine" things if he sees me doing them too. I was really into nail stamps for a time. He liked when I painted his nails and stamped a t-rex skull on them and even asked me to redo them when they chipped. I don't push fem or masculine and just let him try what he wants to try. As long as he's not hurting anyone, I'm good with it.
‚ÄúDo you understand me?‚Äù What a sad prick
Yup my son love to do what his sisters are doing and I‚Äôm not going to stop my little dude from being himself he also loves monster trucks and cars but will throw on some wings and be fairy I love it.
Religion  sucks!
Yeah, people use lucky in an odd way sometimes. I've never had my face broken in 20 places, what does that make me?
If you love what you do, you'll never work a day in your life.
It‚Äôs too late. The gay spores got him as soon as he put the dress on.
Ms Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could, become a magician to adracadabra all the sadder
Gaza is broke because Hamas uses all the aid money on weapons
Seriously the LGTBQ needs to stand down. We are all anti oppression. But the folksYour supporting want us all dead.
When my brother and I were kids our parents bought us kid-size robes to wear after a bath. One evening we were in our little robes and discovered that if we put socks in the chest area we looked like we had boobies!! Omg we thought it was hilarious‚Ä¶ we didn‚Äôt think beyond that, no gender confusion or anything‚Ä¶ just like, ‚Äúhey we‚Äôve got boobs - haha!‚Äù Well our dad heard us laughing and came to see what was up. Holy fuck, I‚Äôll never forget the rage-tantrum that followed about how we‚Äôre sick and that‚Äôs disgusting and he slammed a door and went out and got wasted drunk. My dad had demons back then. He came around and became an allstar unconditionally loving dad and eventually things like this moment never phased him. But back then - that reaction, us being only 5 and 7 at the time, I still carry that darkness that he made me feel. I still don‚Äôt feel right if I wear something feminine- and I‚Äôm GAY. Shit like this really fucks you up for the long haul.
This is what‚Äôs missed. Everyone jumping on the transphob train.He‚Äôs the parent. He clearly did not want his son in a dress. No teacher should be doing things to kids that the parents do not want.
You legend!
Every single kid in there has a face like they just got caught doing something bad.
What happens to the Jews when Palestine becomes free?
That's crazy insecure
You don't have to jump for joy. Anyone saying otherwise is just as cringe. The issue is shaming and embarrassing your son for something so mundane. It's a child bro, just let him have fun.
Repost, OP is not the rider in the video.
First off my sincerest apologies I was rushing through and was just focusing on my own rebuttals. I am sorry for your struggles, I am just a random American who has no idea how to help, and selfishly I‚Äôm sick of watching the world burn.Again my apologies.
personally, I feel its gay to be afraid of turning gay. If you're sure you like what you like, then not much externally is going to change that.

Biker:  Hold my feeding tube!
Lots of people on reddit like to tell parents how to parent their kids, despite the fact that the vast majority of said people have absolutely no experience when it comes in to having and raising children.
No i support dragons and magic... More realistic
Well if you can't even intimidate your son's caregivers anymore, then what is the point of being a man? Gotta make sure they know it for sure, for sure. Like, for sure *for sure*.
Once again. You don't know who I am. I just told you I lived in Palestine for 10 years.  Was 7 years old when the Intifada started. You're the one behind a screen trying to tell an entire nation to give up on their independence. I had to carry my US passport going to 2nd grade walking ...in fear a tank will randomly shoot at me. I only commented because of your false claim of being Pro Palestine. It's like saying I'm pro LGBT following up with however I don't think they should have the same rights...etc
Because he is also an influencer attention whore?
Easy to say you want total war behind a computer screen with out actually seeing the realities of war. Palestine like Tibet, is gone. Like Indigenous nations in the America is gone. It is a sad and ugly truth. We can help them better if we can end this and start moving forward with peace within what will be Isreal.
Willem on lifeguard duty
He is one of those people who posts stuff online that gets picked up by Fox News and they put some bullshit about how they are teaching children to be trans. And their viewers will pedal the same bs. And Trans people will get more hate.
It is a great misunderstanding amongst progressives that intersectionality can be applied to this extraordinarily complex conflict. Too many view this within the oversimplified oppressor vs oppressed dynamic when North American class warfare does not apply at all. Our heart breaks for the Palestinian people, but Jews for thousands of years have also been an oppressed group, a history that is fundamental to the origins of where we are today.
Pro Palestine doesn't mean your anti people dying. It's a term used in support of Palestinians that want their freedom and sovereignty. There will be a total war in the Middle East..that's imminent.Also I lived through the chaos there and don't have to be reminded by a fake supporter stating people are dying.  11 family members lost to the IDF. The same way you say keep heads out of clouds...that's what the Palestinians will respond to you saying to fall back ane give up on their hopes.
You forgot the terrorists who tied up Isreali mothers and children and burned them alive 2 weeks ago.
And notice that the day by day ruler can‚Äôt be too wrong
You don't think this could have harmful repercussions down the line?  He didn't even try to take his son aside and explain to him what the problem was (probably because it's impossible to explain without sounding ridiculous.) He just freaked out while filming the whole ordeal.  Making kids feel confused and ashamed about things they enjoy doing is not good parenting.  You gotta explain WHY what they're doing is not ok to do while reassuring them that it doesn't mean they're bad.  Then again, like I said before, I don't think there is any sort of logical reason why this kid can't wear a dress so...it might be hard to explain.
This is developmentally appropriate behavior for his age. Kid‚Äôs play is about reflecting and then processing the world around them. Preschool aged kids experiment with gender roles. And most of the time, it doesn‚Äôt stick. They will play with toys or play games typically ‚Äúmeant‚Äù for the opposite gender. They will also usually play with kids of the different sex. By the time they‚Äôre about 5 or 6, or in kindergarten, they will typically fall into their gender ‚Äúroles‚Äù and play how you‚Äôd expect them to. Ex: for boys, they‚Äôll play adventure like games or with trucks and such and the play will most likely only involve boys. Boys dressing up in dresses or feminine clothing or trying to be a mom to a baby is no worry. They are simply trying to make sense of their place in the world. Eventually, they will grow out of it and move on. The only thing this behavior that the father is exhibiting will do is put shame around whatever this activity is. And because he‚Äôs so young, he won‚Äôt know what to do with said shame. It‚Äôs hard for people who don‚Äôt feel comfortable or aren‚Äôt knowledgeable in child development to watch this sort of thing but it‚Äôs a very normal, important part of play.
Semis can‚Äôt slow down in 2 seconds
Awesome
Fr. If I was one of the other parents of one of these kids and I saw this video, I‚Äôd tell OOP to never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever post my kid on the internet again. Ever.
And the fucking trauma he caused those he involved in his bullshit. Even if he survived I bet that truck driver got plenty of nightmares from this
I‚Äôm interested in their safety, they are never going to have their fucking land again. It‚Äôs beyond reasonable at this point without total war in the Middle East. Get your head out of the clouds, people are dying.
You aren't a Palestine supporter. You call yourself one. You just support peace not their independence.
Poor little guy.
LMFAO. I was not expecting that.
It was like.. There was 2 skys Jenny.. one on top of another..
Probably to show his drinking buddies how he owned the libs that day and took control of a situation that was obviously getting wayyyyyy too out of hand
That was unnecessary.
Wait so what I'm getting from most of these comments is he can't parent his kid the way he wants?
IDF basic training learns them not to do it to non-arabs, part of why everyone has to go to the military/s
Aokiji is that you?
The fuck is he doing recording other kids too? If I were a parent of one of those kids there'd be an issue.
I knew where this was going the moment Barbie entered the chat.
The most beautiful place I've ever been. Even 4 years after, I'm still thinking it was just a dream
I'm not convinced they are alive."I was lucky" is in quotes, implying it's not OP in the video. (and OP has confirmed, not them)
This is dumb as hell, he just wants to play with the other kids. I have 1 son and several daughters and they all went one halloween in second hand costumes as  superheros in big puffy skirts and my son asked if he could could wear the skirt for the iron man costume (it wasn't necessary, the rest of the costume was there) and I was like heck yeah dude do you. Especially on halloween no one sees any implication in all that crap. My son has worn his sister's clothes to school, he's asked to have his hair done like them, I never denied him anything. Let him play in makeup and wear glitter and angel wings around the house.Now he builds rc cars and reads about boats all day and all this other masc shit that he didn't get from me. He was always going to be him, kids that age just see gender as a buffet
It makes my hole weak
Israeli forces vs people who do not want to follow police orders\*. There I fixed it for you
Many years ago I went to my babysitting gig and the parents were like "Boy Child has something he wants to show you!" And he comes out in a Cinderella dress complete with slippers. He was so happy showing off his slippers and how the dress ballooned when he was spinning. He was talking about how his friend outgrew the dress and gave it to him and how nice the gift was. I'll never forget it as the first time I got to share a purely innocent, unencumbered joy as an adult. Pops here missed out and I feel bad for him.
I‚Äôd not the next one May just remove his head. Period.
I agree that the main event was 1948, I don't think there is any argument there. I also never said jews didn't exist in the area. My point was that everything that Isreal projects in terms of the whole david vs Goliath narrative is not the complete picture. But serious question for you, who out there disagrees that the holocaust didn't play a major role in the creation of a Jewish homeland. I thought that point was a consensus on all parties. The real conflict became when that homeland had people already living there. Which again you can easily find proof that even many Palestinian Jews didn't agree with. The only thing you can argue on that point is what percentage of Palestinian jews disagreed with it, and there yeah I won't argue that it wouldn't have been a massive number because their religious group was benefitting.As for the Palestinians refusing every deal they have agreed countless times to go to 1967 borders. You can even find a lot of clips of Isreali politicians speaking about it. The thing is here is where It will go back and forth. Obviously you know my stance, I can guess yours. You know full well if we went back and forth we can both find literature to back up our own points. My points will come from critics of Isreal and your will come from those in favor. But one thing you should definitely agree with is that there has been well documented genealogy studies that have proven that most Palestinian Christians and Muslims are native to that land just like Palestinian jews. But as long as you can grab random dudes from Brooklyn or Africans from Ethiopia and give them "birth right" and not give any sort of citizenship to Palestinians you are never going to resolve this issue.

Idk, they see it and suddenly it's filled with idiots.
It's not the embarrassment, it's that he humilitated and degraded his son and made it seem sick and wrong and weird to wear a dress. It's a kid having fun! He's probably not even gay or queer or anything but now he's always going to have these weird issues over the way he dresses and the way his father perceives him because of this.As a girl if my dad had ever humiliated me like this for wearing an article of clothing it would've fucked me up, because as a kid you just can't understand what you've done wrong. Look at the way he runs to hug the teacher.This dad is a bully and this poor kid should have the freedom to not even think about what clothes mean like any normal kid should.
Actually depressing, isn't it? Like the screenshots of men telling a painting on Facebook how beautiful it is and asking it to marry them.
Jesus my dude. Simmer down, he's a little ass kid having fun

Heaven.
As the father of two young boys, I feel so bad for this kid.
Explore it...through a screen.
Good God. My dad was as manly as they come, but he laughed his ass off when my brother put on my mom‚Äôs bra and clomped around in her high heels. Even took a picture. It was no big deal.
I kinda understand the shock.I have no problem if my son wanted to dress up like this, but I would have a serious problem if the teachers did this without first consulting me or my wife due to his age. Don't take liberties with children that are not permitted to.
This removed my head from my own ass, I can't imagine not coming out of this way overly careful
Hamas goes in and murders hundreds, and when they get a savage response, everyone got Pikachu surprised face. Not one Palestinian warned israel of this attack. If the US tried to stop this, we would be hypocrites. 9/11 happened, and we went full force into Iraq and wiped out the government power. Even though it was a group like hamas, we still wrecked the country. Hamas did this and even said to attack people worldwide, and again, they lived and trained in Palestine and no one attempted to assist in getting rid of them or asking for help.
Bikes gonna need  a wash
Any video that starts with a screaming, wailing, gun shot, explosion, crashing or destruction is just lousy.
Yea u gotta let your son dress as a girl to make complete strangers happy and let the world know you‚Äôre not obsessed with gender, know the internet, pal

It's not. But yes, these things have always been happening on a regular basis even before Oct 7. In Israel, Christians are considered idol worshippers. [They literally think Muslims are better.](https://youtu.be/HY1IyRGiHNs?si=0Yy8MkX-8QZx-k0p)
Oh please. Hamas could disappear tomorrow and Palestinians would still be sequestered in Gaza and pogrommed in the West Bank.

Forever never seems that long until you are grown.
Kids don't know any better. They don't associate things with gay vs non-gay. He's having fun with his mates. So what's the issue?
1. Gaza Blockade is a bit of a chicken/egg situation. Israel says they did it to protect its citizens from terror attacks after the second intifada (2000-2005). Hamas says they do the terror attacks because of the blockade. In 2006, Israeli troops and settlements were withdrawn with Gaza. The terror attacks and blockade have continued as one perpetuates the rest. I don‚Äôt think Israel enforces a blockade for fun. 2. Stating that all of this started after WWII shows an utter lack of understanding of its history. Migration of Jews to Palestine started in 1850s. At that time, the land was sparsely populated with a total population of 350k. Over the next century, the population exploded to over 2 million with large numbers of Jews and Arabs migrating to the area for various reasons. Mass migration on both sides caused conflict. 3. I‚Äôve already commented that there was no clearing out of Palestinian villages prior to the war in 1948. And your numbers are off. 4. Palestinians have refused multiple 2 state solutions. When you say they have tried for a solution-you mean they have tried to eliminate Israel.

Is it wrong to not want ur kid in a dress??
That's what happens in war the Americans did it the Germans did it the Russians did it the British did it japan did it. its not just exclusive to isreal
This is very inaccurate i recommend you to read history
I was totally on track to be a standout alpha male until they let me put on a dress for a class activity when I was 4 and that turned me trans and if only I had a dad that said ‚Äúever‚Äù like this guy I‚Äôd be slingin‚Äô chics over my shoulder like Rambo at a Taylor swift show and damn it why did they let them turn me trans like that?!?
Salar dr Uyuni! One of many beautifully unique and underrated places in South America.
Before ww1 there were palastinans living there and there were palastinans jews also, then the British decided to make palestine as a Jewish state and kept sending great amounts of jews to palastine and in 1948 those jews declared the state of isreal and forced palastinans to move out from there homes and take there land.This is what started all of this and i blame the British
Russia declaring support to Palestine and Israel threatening Russia over this is so funny, like, my guys, you both might reconsider your priorities at the moment.
I cannot upvote this enough. That's what we always say when we see a motorcycle rider doing stupid shit (which is almost daily).

Indeed
I don't see what's so hard to understand. Not everyone Israeli/Jew hates Palestinians/Muslims and not every Palestinian/Muslim hates Israelis/Jews and not everyone is hell bent on the destruction of the other. They/WE are all victims of our governments and the most fanatical of terrorists at times. Both of these bad actors thrust their own people in harms way creating chaos and trying to get the world to pick sides as if the lines are clear cut. Hamas needs to be eradicated and Israel needs to be condemned for their unproportionate response to Hamas  affecting the innocent Palestinian people who have nowhere to go.

Why did she brace for it?
That's what i'm saying, then you correlate footage of Hamas missiles being fired and one goes hay wire and falls to the city at the same time that the hospital was reported of being bombed. Yet people still believe this was an intentional Israel strike. We've seen all the propaganda that came out of Ukraine and Russia, you think people would be more cautious to take sides on these stories without the proof being there by now.

Did we watch the same video?  The semi veers into the left lane to try to avoid the motorcyclist because the motorcycle is drifting right. The semi obviously can't go all the way into the left lane because the truck was there, so he rides the line trying to squeeze in-between the truck and the motorcycle (hopefully the truck is okay, obviously the semi ends up side swiping the motorcycle because there's just not enough room).  The semi driver is probably on the breaks too but there's only so much breaking you can do when you're in front of 35k pounds, while also trying to thread a needle.  A semi just can't slow down as quickly as the much smaller truck.

It is indeed a multifaceted issue. There are no so-called one size fits all solutions. Absolutism is the problem. On both sides of the binary, bipartisan bipolar bullshit
The Christian priests were not attacked but pushed away. If the populace nearby interferes with police activity, they need to be push away. In the US they would‚Äôve been all arrested and/or shot
Permanent loss of licence and a list of charges is the only reasonable response.
The Israel-Palestine problem has no real solution that can actually be achieved. Even the best compromise will be rejected by the vocal extremists on both sides. Any existence of Israel will be opposed and any secession of currently occupied Jewish land would also be opposed. Also I don't see any way groups like Hamas or Hezbollah are really going to cease as their ideology isn't just political, it's religious fanaticism. Israel will never be held accountable either.

Unless they are blind I'm pretty sure about all of us will see it.
while I agree, he isn‚Äôt being malicious he is a dumb fuck, especially because as you pointed out, he thinks it would be OK if he was more skilled. It doesn‚Äôt matter how skilled you are lane splitting is dangerous and should not be done. Lane Filtering is one thing and legal in a couple places, but lane splitting you‚Äôre asking to die or to cause a crash.
LOL thats fucking dumb. reckless driving is not cool, its not a skill that you should aim to master. I fucking hope you learned something from this

No. The police has a duty of protecting the order. The person was causing disorderly conduct by going through a side of the street that was closed and they decided to detain him.Not everything that happens in Israel is the ‚ÄúJOOZ attacking us, poor minority being repressed‚Äù like silence
I feel like we should really let natural selection burn through a few times and get rid of some of this nonsense.
This! I can't believe people think that is a valid retaliation. They are committing war crimes. It's wretched and shouldn't be tolerated, on either side. An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind.
Exactly! üòÇüòÇüòÇ

The nazis are happy you fuckers are killing each other. Way to go idiot.
Skill or not riding like that on a road with other people is a lack of care for not just yourself but everyone around you. You‚Äôre more likely to die but the person that you smashed your skull into has to live the rest of their life with that on them. Go to a race track or something is all I‚Äôm saying. If you want to risk your life do it on your own dime. Glad you‚Äôre ok tho.
A 35 second Mortuary scene would do just fine

Turns out it was hammas, don't jump the gun next time without the evidence to back it up.
correction: The truck driver might be traumatised for life right now. Almost killing someone is already more than enough to cause trauma. It's entirely possible that this truck driver can't drive anymore because of this incident.
He didn‚Äôt learn shit. Notice he says nothing about being lucky nobody else was killed/hurt. Only a narcissistic fuck would drive like this and comment about themselves‚Ä¶
If this doesn‚Äôt get your license revoked for a few years there is no justice in the world. It probably won‚Äôt stop you though.
She keeps screaming "Sharmuta" which is "whore" in Arabic. No Hebrew here.Everything else sounds like she speaks something like german or something like that.

Don't worry, he'll get an even faster bike next time and take out a mini van with a family inside.
Into the backrooms with her.
Yeah, but that pickup didn't deserve the damage to the back of his truck, and that semi didn't deserve a motorcycle up under his wheels.
almost won a darwin award
You don‚Äôt listen well, still working on the GED?
Lucky is the people that could have died because of you and did not.
Exactly what I was thinking. Thank you
The tragedy here is the other people's days you ruined.
They need to go back to their country and help them then instead of standing there screaming like this generation does
Doesn‚Äôt seem like it. His statement was  ‚Äúhad lots of confidence with little skill‚Äù not ‚ÄúI shouldn‚Äôt be riding recklessly in an uncontrolled setting, endangering myself and others‚Äù - it makes it seem like OP thinks that practice and honing his skillset would make the riding in the video ok.
how did you not get clipped by the semi? Was he slowing down? and you were able to get out of the way? Damn man. Glad you're ok. but don't do that again for your own safety and others around who may inadvertently kill you and have that on their minds forever.
Gave me flashbacks to the water temple dark link fight in ocarina of time.

I wish that everyone who rides like this would die on the road in single-vehicle accidents, I.e. wipe out without affecting innocent people.
Brain dead muppet
He owns it in the description.
Hey man we all make mistakes.But doing over 100 lane splitting.... I don't know what to call that
Insta 360, camera that attaches out of a selfie stick on the back of the bike. Super cool device
Yes.
"America is composed of a group of United States, where each state has its own laws."  That does not actually change anything for me, the core idea is still same, ppl of each independent state would exactly follow that independent statue own rules.
Makes you wonder, aye
Get tested for toxoplasmosis. Not even kidding.
Pretty sure it's in quotes because OP is not the rider, just copying the description from the source.
Does anyone know how he was filming himself? It seems like someone is behind him, but that obviously doesn't make any sense.
Well, stupid fucks usually have good luck
Tf . . can you get more holy a place of worship ?
He better hope they dont make a sequel.
I don‚Äôt think this is OC. His comments are in quotes, so I‚Äôm guessing he get the comments from the person that was actually in the video. Skimmed through his history to see if there was anything related, but didn‚Äôt see anything. Didn‚Äôt look very far though.
Also caused him whiplash and probably neckpain.
In my experience It‚Äôs almost always the bikers fault for cutting the cars off outta nowhere at 90 MPH
Well that looks bloody gorgeous
Op isn't the biker you dummies
Looks like the tokyo ghoul intro
Fuck anyone who does this kind of stupid shit. Driving is dangerous enough without reckless assholes risking their own life and the lives of those around them for no damn reason. Want an adrenaline rush? Get it from means that don‚Äôt increase my risk of being maimed or dying in a horrible accident.
This happened in 2018, She was US Ambassador at the time. I know because I was there.
Pretty much, same with the drivers who act like entitled jackasses speeding down the highway and swerving between cars acting like OP was doing, but with cars
Naturally filming themselves, no doubt for validation on TikTok or some stupid shit.If that truck driver had killed him, he could have been potentially traumatized for life all because some moron drives like a jackass to impress people they‚Äôll never meet.
Me too, this is the comment of a kind soul where a lot of us have become so jaded we‚Äôd be hoping this guy removed himself from the gene pool to not hurt/kill others due to their stupidity.  I‚Äôm gonna try to be a slightly better person today.
Yeah I can see? I was curious if they did, since it still makes sense as a Christian in Arabic.

That was a good Muslim Samaritan who wanted to help out. You can literally see them wearing crosses if you want to.
&gt;Lots of confidence for little skillHe laments about little skill. It doesn't matter how "skilled" you are, you shouldn't treat the road like your little playground. Learning the wrong lesson, that he just needed more skill, is a big fuckin red flag.
I don‚Äôt usually have my jaw left hanging open but this subreddit does a damned good job of it. Like what the fuck.
You‚Äôre playing with life brother, next time could be your last. Ride safe man
That‚Äôs not called ‚Äúconfidence‚Äù that‚Äôs called riding like a dipshit. Even if you avoided that truck you are still a danger to yourself and everyone else on the road. I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre alive but I hope you learned your lesson.
Am more surprised on how oblivious that semi truck driver was. He was trying to finish the job
Do Arab Christians often shout the takbir still?Edit: weird to downvote? I was genuinely curious
Do more research:Two states have a minimum marriage age of 15 years old, Hawaii and Missouri, and two states have the lowest minimum marriage age, which is 14 years old. Those states are Massachusetts and New Hampshire.Btw I don‚Äôt care what you think so stop trying to make me think like you.
I'm still going to verbally abuse OP
Finally people are starting to see through the propaganda and standing for what's right.
I got to 10 seconds left and still couldn‚Äôt see how she was getting BMX‚Äôd
IKR? I wonder why they didn‚Äôt slow down or try to avoid him. I‚Äôm sure they saw him.
I understand that the video is not OP, however it‚Äôs still a fucking stupid video and whoever that idiot was is lucky to even be alive, people have died for a lot less.The OC of this content is stupid and they got what they deserve for being so idiotic. It‚Äôs just sad that they dragged in other people while also endangering everyone‚Äôs life. They don‚Äôt care about their safety and clearly no one else‚Äôs.
This guy should never ever be allowed to drive anything ever again, holy shit what a flapping anus.
Thank God the video cut üôè he could've gotten hurt real bad
Buffoon alert!
exactly, i understand that OP regrets his actions but people like him actively ruin the road for everyone and his stupid actions could have seriously injured or traumatized innocent people. No remorse for reckless bikers looking for a thrill ride.
Those borders have been offered multiple times in peace talks in the 70s, 90s, and in 2000. Every time, they were rejected in some fashion by Palestine.Surprise, those borders are off the table now after 10/7. Hamas and the PLA shouldn't act so shocked pikachu about it, they had every chance to accept a better deal when they still had some bargaining power.
Maybe this will deter other riders from doing the same  stupid shit. Haha... Just kidding. They'll do it anyway because they're "better" riders.
Let me clear out this in another way:  in the USA, there is a law where marring a girl under the 18 yo is illegal.So how many American citizens does follow this law? 98% of them ?.  Answer is the superior majority of American citizens does actually follow this law because it's one of their country lows.  A law is just a set of rules, and a religion is ALSO just a set of rules.  Now imagine the following, you have a country that is being formed based on the Jewish religion itself and that Jewish religion says any other human that is not a Jewish is an animal in the form of human, in a country where all people faithfully follow and obey their religion, WHAT DO YA EXPECT THOSE PPL TO BELIEVE ?
Well, if you weren't in the running for a future Darwin award before, you definitely are now.
OP isn‚Äôt the person in the video. Hence the quotation marks.

One of the best comments I‚Äôve seen here. Caused me to actually comment.
This is flat out incorrect
You shouldn't be allowed to use any motor vehicle again, perhaps not even bicycles
It's called *locked horizon*. Both GoPro and Insta360 cameras can do it.You can throw the camera up spinning crazy, and the video will look perfect stable afterwards.
Holy shit, how did that semi not make ground beef out of you. üò±I hope you appreciate your second chance with a complete body.
It‚Äôs a 360 degree camera hoisted from a pole on the rear of the bike. The camera automatically edits the pole out.
Bro wtf
&gt; but I'm not sure what you're referring to in the 90s.How do you feel confident enough to comment on the history of Israel and Palestine and not even know about the Oslo accords?

Arab Christians*
Calling them misguided then spewing the most Zionist-brainwashed ignorant talking point is incredible.
Lucky he‚Äôll get a chance to learn from his dumb mistake. Some people are so dumb that even the afterlife doesn‚Äôt want them.
You're a selfish prick with no concern for the safety and well being of others.I don't wish you pain or hardship but your actions could of just as easily put that on everyone you involved in your antics.I could not have of imagined inadvertently being the reason someone dies because I run them over after they play pin ball on the highway because they wanted to  go fast on their bike and put others and themselves in danger. Sir, go fuck yourself.
It looked like it was going toward the opposite though.
These dumbasses screw everyone‚Äôs day up
Bibi's support in Israel is actually falling though, to the point where there's a good chance he won't be reelected even *with* Israel's 9/11 on his side.By all recent polls, Palestinian support for Hamas is actually *rising*.
Hamas will keep attacking regardless of what Israel does. Thus they need to be removed
You shouldn‚Äôt be alive
Yeah because Hamas (with general support from Palestinians both local and abroad, look at the polling) is MORE Pro-genocide than Israel, they're just too damn stupid and poor to do it correctly. If you gave them Israel's military budget and tools, Israel would be a pile of rubble within a week. Don't believe me? Look at their stated goals, look at the stated goals of the countries funding them. Why do you think there's always a massive controversy over Iran's nuclear deals?
How was this footage recorded?
The amount of people that don‚Äôt understand OP is not the person in the video. The caption is in quotes for a reason lmfao

This is disnformation. This lie is thrown out a lot to justify the takeover of the houses. However 84% of Palestinian displacement could be attributed to Israel according to IDF records[From Israeli's own declassified reports](https://www.akevot.org.il/en/article/intelligence-brief-from-1948-hidden-for-decades-indicates-jewish-fighters-actions-were-the-major-cause-of-arab-displacement-not-calls-from-arab-leadership/#:~:text=The%2025%2Dpage%20document%20entitled,leaders%20impacted%20the%20displacement%20of): &gt;Intelligence brief from 1948 hidden for decades indicates Jewish fighters‚Äô actions were the major cause of Arab displacement, not calls from Arab leadership.&gt;According to IDF intelligence estimates, as of June 1, 1948 (in the next 6 months a similar sized exodus would occur again), 370,000 Arabs had left. *84% were due to direct Israeli actions (55% due to attacks, 15% due to terrorism, 2% due to whispering campaigns, 2% due to evacuations by the IDF, and 10% due to general fear)*. About 5% left on orders from Arab bands. And finally, another 11% left voluntarily.- Israeli historian Flapan in *[The Palestinian Exdous of 1948](https://www.jstor.org/stable/2536718?typeAccessWorkflow=login)*As you can see, only about 5% left on orders from Arab bands

Why did he stop in the first place? Probably trying to start some shit
Cause there was nothing blocking his car at the beginning of the video. The dude could have kept driving but stopped to instigate. #1 rule of carrying a firearm is to avoid confrontation if possible. He was looking to start something where he could take out his gun to defend himself. Grade A piece of shit

Dude you need to study your history before you keep spreading lies and falsehoods.First, you mention the 1967 borders. Do you know why the 1967 borders were changed? BECAUSE THE ARAB WAR MASSED AN ARMY TO ATTEMPT TO EXTERMINATE THE JEWS.Even after the Six-Day war, the Israelis offered the Palestinians EXACTLY what you claim they want.&gt;Rogers Plan (1969-1970):  &gt;  &gt;U.S. Secretary of State William Rogers proposed a plan calling for an Israeli withdrawal from territories occupied in the 1967 war, with security guarantees for Israel and the recognition of all states in the region. The plan was not accepted by the Arab states, including the Palestinians.Despite the Palestinians declining repeated peace offers by Israel, Israel kept offering...1. Camp David Summit (2000):&gt;Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak offered a plan that would have given Palestinians a state in Gaza and most of the West Bank, as well as parts of East Jerusalem. Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader, rejected the offer.  &gt;  &gt;2. Taba Summit (2001):  &gt;  &gt;Following the Camp David Summit, negotiations continued at Taba, where additional concessions were made by the Israeli side. However, these talks also ended without an agreement when the Palestinian leadership refused to negotiate.   &gt;  &gt;3. Annapolis Conference (2007):  &gt;  &gt;A peace conference held in Annapolis, Maryland, resulted in a joint statement by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas to continue negotiations. However, these talks eventually stalled when the Palestinian leadership refused to offer a counterproposal.   &gt;  &gt;4. Kerry Initiative (2013-2014):  &gt;  &gt;U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry led a peace initiative that aimed to restart negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians. While some progress was made, the talks ultimately collapsed.Time and time again the Palestinians decline the two-state solution **BECAUSE THEY WILL ONLY ACCEPT A PLAN THAT INVOLVES THE GENOCIDE AND REMOVAL OF THE JEWS.**Learn your history, bud.
They really put the squeekiest voices in charge if the chant...
No that's an excellent explanation, thank you for your perspective!
I have corrected that number. The point still stands though. There are an estimated 6 million Palestinians in the diaspora and 7.5 within Isreal and occupied territory. That number would most definitely make them into a majority, do you disagree with the point?The Jewish population in Isreal is 7.1 Million as of 2023.
An entire mob of people basically trying to manufacture an excuse to beat you to death
Nikki Nikki can‚Äôt you see , you are actually Indian
Frontlines of what? These people are worthless and are one of the reasons hard right, religious extremist governments keep getting voted into power. Haredi parties are in the collaition with Netanyahu are help prop up his pretty far right government.Just becuase they protest outside a military office(which is usually because they refuse conscription on th3 basis that they want tax payer money to study in Yeshiva) doesn't mean they aren't right wing.These are the folks spitting on people of other religions or treating women and less religious Israelies like trash.
But what does it mean when the majority of Palestinians support the inhuman behavior of Hamas? I just can't get around that. Yes the top few holding power in Israel created Hamas, but why do so many people choose violence that has proven to continually make things worse. I just can see Palestinians as completely innocent bystanders in all of this.
A few Orthodox Jews are not ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äù
What events have occurred that make you still consider it a bad idea?
You‚Äôre posts is filled with false facts and exaggeration. You said millions of Palestinians were pushed out of their homes and villages violently attacked. There were only 1.4 million total Arab Muslims (now called Palestinians) in 1947-1948 in the total area of Israel/West Bank/ Gaza. The Nakba occurred in 1948, after the Palestinians, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon, Syria attacked Israel. During the WAR, Approximately, 750k Palestinians were displaced. This is well established fact.
I just don't understand why they feel the need to block roads and piss people off when they do this shit. It's doing NOTHING but inconveniencing people who can't do anything to help their cause. Literally just minding their own business trying to go about their day. If I had to sit in traffic due to a bunch of assholes running around and screaming about something that we have zero control over, I wouldn't want to listen to what they have to say. They're just making people not want to sympathize with their cause. I genuinely just don't understand the thought behind this. Your rally here is not going to help the people overseas. Its just not.
Hard to support a cause when the activists aren‚Äôt rational characters.
Looks like her last working fuse just blew.
Yes that would be ideal too
Do the 850,000 Jews who were expelled from Arab countries also get to go back and get their land back?
https://imeu.org/article/israels-history-of-assassinating-palestinian-leadersUnder this link on Google was a whole wikipedia page of their assassinations as well as hundreds more pages for you to browse through when you decide to take your head out of your own ass
People who support Palestine are really good at making other people not support Palestine.
By all means show evidence of these assasinations.Israel military, at least part, was against it because they didn‚Äôt want to kick Jews out of their homes.Israle military critiqued funds for mosques, and universities separate from plo in Gaza in the 80‚Äôs years later, as well as a blind eye to Muslim charities because they laid the ground work for Hamas, however your crystal ball is cracked if you think israel cracking down on religious groups in the early 80‚Äôs wouldn‚Äôt have some other unintended blowback.
Bet they were all screaming racism while mobbing that car and being psychos.
So are Palestinians. There's a DNA similarity between them and the remaining of Canaanites.
Dehumanizing victims as a defense mechanism is a dead give away to disregard your shameful existence. We will send you to die in frontlines first when it happens brave soul.
There was an attempt of peace in 2000 with Camp David, but I'm not sure what you're referring to in the 90s.The reality of today is that neither side supports the two state system.
I think they just want to be able to leave the West Bank and Gaza  and return freely without fear of being killed. Clean food and water, etc.Israel just keeps bombing Gaza because Hamas is in there.It‚Äôs like setting a school on fire because there‚Äôs a school shooter inside.
yeah , a punch would have sufficed
Why aren‚Äôt Arabs who moved into palestine/Israel post wwi colonizers?
&gt; HamasBullshit.Hamas has never said they would recognize israe.  They said they would accept temporary peace with 67 borders but doesn‚Äôt recognize Israel.  That is just a time for them to regroup.
&gt;And a long period of healing begins, but at least this time, the core issues are dealt withIf it was the core of the issue the partition plan would have been accepted, or maybe even very surrounding Arab state wouldn‚Äôt have declared war when British left and Israel said they were going to form a state.Your fox would turn Israel into a Jewish minority country with Ana rav majority who largely wanted them wiped out.  That won‚Äôt work.
One of them kick the police ass and got tf out like his mission was accomplished.
And then be chased down by motorcycles doesn‚Äôt help. These peeps are lucky they didn‚Äôt get run over, honestly. Person could easily fear for their life here

There are those that don't support Israel... I refer to them as the "Progressive fairies".  As depicted here : [https://youtu.be/wUKGsAVsyMA](https://youtu.be/wUKGsAVsyMA)  This sums up the situation in Israel.
Thats not a rally, its a mob.
Wasn't that offer made in the 90s and again in 2000? It was definitely rejected then. If these groups "came around" to the agreement later, is it then on Israel to retroactively agree again? Seems to me they'd need to sit down again and stop the violence first.I'd support agreements like this but there has to be contention made for the fact that the Israelis have to control the process considering they won every conflict and it's their survival at stake.
Our democratic partners in the Middle East. They‚Äôre as reliable a partner as Saudi Arabia. Both are vile governments we shouldn‚Äôt have anything to do with in all honesty.
&gt;Is it Israel ceases to exist and the ‚Äúcolonizers‚Äù must leave?This is the one. I grew up with many Jordanian friends. This was their view across multiple households. They also had framed art in the house depicting Palestinian "triumphs". Unapologetically violent about it as well. These were immigrants to the US. We uhh... Stopped being friends over it.
Israel created Hamas as an excuse to continue oppressing the Palestinians. The international community wouldn‚Äôt let them just kill people so they have to do it in the name of ‚Äúself-defense.‚Äù
You can thank Hamas for the violence.
Lol. This is so hypocritical. Israelis to this day are still moving Palestinians out of their homes. They have displaced, during just the nakba, 750,000 Palestinians out of their homes. During the last 3 weeks, since Oct 7th, 1.4M Palestinians‚Äô homes have been destroyed, leaving them all homeless.This doesn‚Äôt include any of the Palestinians who have had israelis take over their home (settlements).Your hypocrisy is absurd.
Yes, but one side is taking the land of the other. Hence‚Ä¶.colonizer
You dog you, that is not funny at all, nope, certainly didn't laugh, nor give an upvote.*clears throat* Violence is never ok, people.
Thanks.  No need to translate the last word.  ‚ÄúOoooo‚Äù seems universal.
You cannot get rid of Hamas with a Bombing campaign. Israel has tried it for well over 30+ years and it has done absolutely nothing.They are demonstrating for the people of Palestine not Hamas.&gt;. Did anyone inform them that Hamas was elected in free and fair elections and since then cancelled any future elections?With the help of Israeli assassinations of PLO members to give Hamas control. That is super important. The IDF is on the record as against the assassinations to install Hamas because they said exactly this would happen.Please tell the whole story not just what makes you look good.
https://www.reddit.com/r/IsrealPalestineWar_23/s/gvpmkEZTS4
I'm happy to hear that displacing 600k people in your view is an acceptable number of people to move outside their homes.
Spend 10 minutes of the /r and others about this conflict. If you're not seeing the fucked up shit from Hamas then it's purposeful avoidance. They're posting this shit everywhere.
What's fucking nuts is both of you were downvoted when I came into this thread just because you want to see an end to innocent children dying in Gaza.
Those are some top tier chants
&gt;? in 2005 Israel went out of Gaza. A few months later Hamas took control and started attackingIf we are being truthful then you need to at least tell people about the factual part of the story where Israel literally assassinated PLO members to hand the area over to Hamas. It's a historical fact and the Israeli military is on the record as against it because it would cause exactly this.Israel literally created this situation on purpose. Please don't leave our critical information in order to make a point that the info undermines.
I feel that Isreal harbored a situation for this to happen, but supporting a group that would use rape, torture and the killing of babies...is that a solution? Those are vile acts that I don't see as a natural reaction to being pushed too far. They chose an inhuman tool to try and obtain their freedom. I was previously pro Palestinian and believed the Israeli occupation needed to end. Now I'm having a harder time feeling bad for the Palestinians if the majority are supporting a group they know uses civilians as sheilds and commits such terrible atrocities. If the majority of Palestinians support a group that would tie children together and burn them alive there is a loss of humanity somewhere. If Palestinians started taking to the streets to protest the Hamas attack I'd feel differently. All that said Isreal is to blame for all of this. They created the situation. It is what it is now though and you can't have people coming across the border to brutally terrorize people. What the Palestinians are willfully choosing by promoting Hamas is something that only makes the situation 100x worse for themselves while committing heinous acts of violence.
Yea, block the obviously important street. That'll get people to support you.
Gaza didn't even elect Hamas, the did a hostile takeover in like 2007.
Holy shit.. i dunno what i was expecting when i read "and gets BMX'd in the Face"? But that was not it. Lol!
Yeah this isn't something that is going to stop with Palestinians. Those people in Israel view themselves as the chosen ones. I've seen more than enough footage of their elected officials calling this a war of "Good vs Evil" and that all "Evil" must be exterminated.They're literally calling for genocide of the innocent and people are cheering them on.
people are more aware in the younger generation and that is reflected in the polls as well
If you're not Pro Palestine you're telling us all you're pro apartheid.
This is less a holy war and more just straight land theft that uses religion to make it more palatable.
You can favour it, but if palestinians and their arab neighbours don't, then it doesn't matter. That was also the case with the UN vote.
This is disinformation.Palestinians, all Fatah and Hamas of them, have accepted a state based in 67 borders. Fatah a long time ago. Hamas 6 years ago.Israel has not accepted a two-state solution and prefers to take the enitre land, but without it's people. If you wanna know why without it's people, simple; extending voting rights to the 5 million West Bankers and 2 million Gazans might lead to the Palestinians controlling the government
But that is not supported by the Palestinian people. Palestinian people do not support the teo state solution.
*it was in this very moment that the israeli government recalled their troops and all of Israel simply marched out of Palestine*
Palestine is a concentration camp?

They don‚Äôt want a two state solution. They want an Islamic caliphate

They are literally arresting people for promoting peace.

You are not even following, try to keep up.*Before* Zionism (which orthodox and liberal Jews detest), Christians, Muslims and Jews lived in relative peace in the area. Yes, this is before the 2 examples you‚Äôve cited and has absolutely nothing to do (and not even geographically co-located) with your 3rd example (which was ‚Äúallegedly‚Äù unintentional, but I doubt it).And this is my point. People (Europeans) were persecuting Jews and perpetrating horrible acts against them, for centuries. Meanwhile, in the area that is Palestine/Israel, and throughout the Middle East for that matter (especially places like Iraq) - Jews, Christians and Muslims were living side by side in peace (basically paradise when compared to horrible things Europeans were doing to Jews).But then Zionism came along and changed all of that. Europeans (who were Jewish, and religious zealots and fundamentalists) decided that Europe could not be the place for them anymore. They wanted to move to Palestine, and didn‚Äôt give a damn about how the societies lived together there. They wanted an ethnostate. Later on, the Europeans finally felt ashamed for the evil they perpetrated on Jews, and decided to support the zionists.
Lmfao

They did this to their *own* people. Imagine what atrocities they are doing to the sub-human Palestinians thay they see as.
&gt; I'm not American so I don't know all the sensitivities when asking the following: Why is it a big deal to show ID to cops?Fair question.  In the US, we have a constitution and laws.  Both attempt to keep things fair.  There are times when you legally have to give a cop an ID, and there are times you do NOT have to.  Cops will often try to lie about when you really have to.  They like having the power, like having people scared of them, willing to do as they are told.  If I break the law, I get in trouble.  If a cop lies and tells me I have to give my ID, they almost never get in trouble.  The more people that stand up for their rights, the better.

I don‚Äôt think this bothers her, she‚Äôs a bona fide war pig. She loves bloodshed.
Lmao nice one!
Zionists are the same terrorists like Hamas just on different sides but for some reason media don't talk about Zionists. cause not all Israel is zionist same as not all Palestinians are pro Hamas
They love fucking up women over there huh?
The same reason people say you can't be pro American and against the federal government

I agree that it is the ancestral land of Palestinians (of those jews, muslims, and christians). It is however not the land of the Europeans that are living there right now, killing and torturing the native people of Palestine.
That would have to mean for israel to have to admit they were an apartheid regime m. Years if propaganda was a lie. Idk how that would play out
You wanted people to accept a 2 state solution in 1948, what a bunch of bullshit. If I barge into your house and force you inside the basement would you settle if I gave you an extra room? A 2 state solution could be an OPTION now because there is no way to move this much zionists outside of the land logistically, and also because it would require moving out people who have no other state, who were actually just born there and don‚Äôt have to do with all this, all of which the Palestinians have the dignity not to indulge in, unlike zionists.
A version where Israelis get to stay and [Palestinians abroad get to return](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_right_of_return?wprov=sfla1) to their houses and villages stolen from them. Arab houses are returned to Arab families who can prove it was theirs prior to '58, and most of these families still have the deeds and keys to their houses from that time, and new housing built for those Israelis. And a long period of healing begins, but at least this time, the core issues are dealt with
Why did you suddenly go back 3000 years to the kingdom of israel to defend what happened less than 100 years ago?The zionists in israel now, the ones who CAME from europe in 1948 are NOT native to the land.What happened in 1948 is nothing short of an attempt at ethnic cleansing, and a great success at colonization of the Palestinian people, and THAT is what you‚Äôre witnessing the effect of right now.Israel was never, and will never, be a legitimate state. Keep playing football in the euros, lol.
Naive. As long as Hamas caters to Bibi‚Äôs needs, Palestine will just keep getting smaller.
There's no shortage of video of Palestinians celebrating in the streets after terror attacks. Historically and recently. Not just in Palestinian lands, but all over the world. And major news outlets don't even promote that footage, that's just what slips through. That should tell you as much as footage of the actual attacks by the terrorists themselves. The whole culture is poison and they were raised on it, sadly. That kind of sickness has no remedy. It isn't made, it's grown and fed.
Colonisation isn‚Äôt settlement. It‚Äôs settlement ***PLUS*** establishing control over the indigenous/local population.India was colonised by the British. After India got independence, there were still British people living there. Same with Brits, French and Portuguese all over Africa (as long as the liberation struggle didn‚Äôt have to get excessively violent, but still in all cases, there were still former colonisers living there).US is in a different category, because they essentially succeeded in genocide, so there‚Äôs not much that can be done (in terms of giving control back to the indigenous population***s***).
Huh, it looks like Zionism can be Anti-semites as well. Would you look at that. It almost looks like Zionism, an Ethno-state ideology is less concerned with Jews than they are about maintaining authoritarian control over an apartheid state and suppressing dissenting voices in the meantime.
The one speech at UPenn I heard was demanding a "Secular, socialist state" for Palestine.
It's not only the Israeli government! All governments are in bed together! It's one big community of kabbalah for them
So what happened before Jordanian control?C‚Äômon, keep going back. Don‚Äôt stop now. What happened in the late 40s? Jews, Muslims and Christians had been living there in *relative* peace for 100s (not too many) of years (and an Arab can be any of the 3).
&gt;(ii) what do they mean by free Palestine anyway?Well what do they mean?
Hamas wouldn't like a peaceful solution.
Because that is the ancestral land of both Jews and Palestinians. Indigeneity arguments alone will not resolve the issue of who must be the rightful rulers, even if some are very loud and confident in their beliefs.

What version of a Free Palestine is would really vary. But they do share one goal. Palestinians not living in a state of apartheid. And that starts with ceasing all hostile actions on civilians in Gaza and West Bank.
Thats some reallygreat protest chant. Im all for it. Miles better than Lets Go Brandon or whatever the fk rightoids will ever come up with.
Native people of the land being allowed onto their land is destruction and ethnic cleansing of jews? Crazy. You do realize this is not a religion issue and you need to stop posing it as such. Jews, Muslims, and Christians were living together just fine before the nakba. The ‚Äújews‚Äù (and I say it in quotations because actual orthodox jews condemn &amp; dismiss these zionists as actual jews) that are currently occupying israel are european immigrants who settled there after WW2, not native people.What I am calling for is that an end is put to the genocide &amp; ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, the settlements be returned back to their original owners (if that would even be possible, I doubt it, but enjoy living in stolen homes I guess), and for Palestinians to be able to live inside mainland Palestine without being denied entry and put under constant surveillance by the zionist occupiers.Gaza &amp; the west bank are open air concentration camps.
I have no doubt in my mind they do, I mean, being gay is literally a crime that gets you 10 years in Palestine lol it's not even a question of if, no one is more persecuted than lgbtq people when it comes to muslims.
Note that this happened way before this particular instance of the ‚Äúconflict‚Äù. Just because I see people treating this like poor israel got attacked all of a sudden for no reason.
It‚Äôs quite simple. It means that the native Palestinian people are allowed back into their land. And for the country to not be called israel, and for Palestinians to not be getting killed and tortured left and right. But that‚Äôs not happening anytime soon, as if you watch political hearings &amp; speeches in israel, israeli politicians are calling for a 2nd nakba. So for now it‚Äôs an us vs them situation.
Why enclose colonizers in quotes? They ARE colonizers. Now I‚Äôm not sure what the solution is because kicking all these people out isn‚Äôt possible/viable/right. But it sure isn‚Äôt committing genocide against the native people, nor is it taking away more land from them.
Yes but they wouldn‚Äôt have decorated their car like that if they were just completely unaware of the meaning.
Unless we have a translation of what was spoken between them I'd say that's a pretty unfair take, not the bike throwing tho, they're definitely in the wrong for that. To me at least, it seems like the whale was trying to instigate something by approaching after words failed.

Only the civilians are suffering and it's heart wrenching and awful. The powers that be on both sides definitely need to stop their shit. Israel needs to stop terrorizing Gaza, Hamas needs to stop attacking Israeli civilians. They are committing war crimes. Period. I'm definitely Pro-Palestine and anti-Hamas. I don't know why so many people don't realize you can be both. The conditions Palestinian citizens have been subjected to are horrendous and need to be corrected. Overall, the blood shed and lack of humanity just needs to stop.

I say this as a pro-Palestine supporter. Palestine will never be free it‚Äôs over. Once Hamas attacked that music festival Isreal was going to attack with force and constant bombing of Gaza. They are going to annex Gaza in a matter of months. It‚Äôs over and it‚Äôs best for the Palestinians/Israelis to come to the table and talk about ending this before future generations spill more blood.
Hassidic. They're like the evangelical Christians of Judaism.
Police brutality needs no more context. Israel is a police state and has fascist ambitions. Non Jewish people against their goals are antisemitic and Jewish people against their goals are self-hating Jews. There are literally rabbis protesting Israel's occupation.

BMX gonna give it to ya
The situation in Israel, based on the reports, is abhorrent, and any sane person would agree.  Based on news reports Hamas sound like complete animals. However, the Israelis in power are equally animals. Their have been many many examples of the murder of Palestinian children being gunned down by the Israeli army over the years. Often it might have been because they threw stones or hurled abuse. And certainly many examples  of children taken into custody who have died while being held. To understand the hatred on both sides is historical and spans 50 years. You can‚Äôt lock people up, in their own country and expect that there is not going to be repercussions. Whether they support Hamas or not is probably not the question, the question is they support their own freedom, which until it is resolved, this ‚Äúwar‚Äù will continue. And probably get worse if Iran get involved.
Mentally ill freak
No, they usually want the full destruction of the State of Israel. Most will have this delusional fantasy that if you simply just destroy Israel and rename it Palestine then all of the sudden Jews and Palestinians will live in perfect peace and harmony in a secular state where both have equal representation and their rights respected by one another. The more honest ones will usually just say that Jews can either accept whatever rule the Palestinians impose on them even if it becomes a repressive Islamic state or "go back to Europe" (ignoring that half of Israeli Jews are Mizrahi from the MENA region). This is of course a geopolitically silly/ignorant argument, setting aside the political/logistical nightmare that would happen if the State of Israel were to be destroyed. Very few countries aside from maybe Iran, Syria, Taliban-ruled Afghanistan and North Korea would actually want the destruction of Israel. Even most Muslim countries are starting to see the benefit of normalizing relations with Israel. I support the two-state solution because it is literally the only possible one. But it would require immense concessions and compromises that neither side is currently willing to make.
There called Gaza and the West Bank
So is taking cyanide. Or can you only process one thing at a time?
Their sure are lots of clowns, under the dome and chanting. No wonder why we are screwed.
i hate it here....
I also heard her say "SHOOT HIM" near the end, too.

This is a good point on the decolonization. These movements need to be pressed on this. Do they literally mean everyone goes back to their country of origin? What does that eveb mean for melting pot countries like the US? In the case of Israel where they also have historic orgins in Israel if not there then where do they go? If this is not what these movements mean then what do they mean specifically? I am generally pretty supportive of these movements actually but so sick of them refusing to tie down exactly what they want and what the end goal is.
The people who defend Hamas are lost. Normal Palestinians have had a pretty rough go of it being human shields and all, along with the Israeli hostages.
Not even sure how to react to this take because it‚Äôs just so brain dead üòÇ
Looks like IDF beating up some defenseless Jews
What concentration camps?
Israel what a nice state. They don't descriminate when it comes to violence. Even their own people! Nice lads definitely
I think they meant Here's as in here is.
Were they born their?
Remember that the Western concept of democracy is inherently liberal.  Liberalism is just as if not more important than democracy.  This is why I don't think democracy is inherently good. An illiberal democracy can be just as oppressive as any other illiberal government. Democracy only holds real value if it is liberal.
Glad the cheer leading lessons have been out to good use.
Are people not watching the same video? The man with the gun stops his car in the middle of the rode, chased a woman and then proceeded to run into an angry mob and chase them. He was seeking confrontation.As for the cops ‚Äúnot stepping in sooner‚Äù there‚Äôs only a handful of cops and you can see them trying to break up some of the fighting but they‚Äôre literally overwhelmed. Stopping him when he pulled out a gun was the right thing to do. How are ppl seeing something different here? The video is very clear.
It's hard to know reality but survey have \~50% Hamas support (not specifically to now)  \&gt;According to a recent survey conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, 57% of Gazans have a positive opinion of Hamas.  https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hamas-wins-palestinian-hearts-gaza-conflict-threatens-broader-shift-n1272330  \&gt;Another poll conducted by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy found that 52% of Palestinians in the West Bank and 64% of Palestinians in East Jerusalem have a positive opinion of Hamas.  [https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/polls-show-majority-gazans-were-against-breaking-ceasefire-hamas-and-hezbollah](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/polls-show-majority-gazans-were-against-breaking-ceasefire-hamas-and-hezbollah)  There are many big celebrations when Hamas kills Israelis, and many interviews of support of Hamas and hate of Israelis/Jews, no one inside Gaza would dare speak against Hamas or in favour or peace or anything, even when people in the west bank express support of Israel they are being harassed/attacked for a long while by the local population. Some that get outside to western countries at times speak out, an interesting one is "sun oh Hamas" if you look him upYou can find many videos not just from this round of hostilities of Gaza militants having children with mortar/rocket launchers or firing from outside a house with a family inside. How do these people feel? I wouldn't want experience that to give you a good answer
Nahh just a bunch of people who have been oppressed their entire lives
That's.. Not cool
People who stand with Palestine are lost.
It really came through
Fuck yah we would
Route 1 Alexandria got the gloves off (not that they had them on regardless)
The foot soldier of an oppressive and unjust system can‚Äôt be good. While he may be a good person outside of being a cop, all cops are bad because our policing is bad.
I think after 100, the horror/anxiety already tops out. But yeah, more like a thousand. Even 100 people already means you are outmatched 100 to you, and they are not likely to fight in turns so it isn't gonna be fair. This causes panic in most if not everyone in that predicament.
‚ÄúGods chosen people‚Äù
Jewish people lived in Palestine before Israel was formed. Christians, Muslims and Jewish people lived together before zionists started the ethnic cleansing and modern Jewish supremest system.
lots in the Leesburg PD are despicable
Know who raised Hamas standing. Funded them and used them to destabilize Palestine to prevent a moderate government from forming? The Israel government. Particularly the PM
Yeah but the person in the car might disagree with me.&amp;#x200B;Can't let them get away with that&amp;#x200B;/s
The fact that they don‚Äôt agree with Israel on religious grounds means they are not blinded to the crimes Israel carries out in their names. Ethnic cleansing and murder are not religious tenants. They probably look at the way Israel treats Palestinians the same way normal Muslims look at how ISIS treated people.
"Come up to your job, hit you while you workin"
They enjoy playing into the cliche of the villain
Oh my goodness, they're acting just like Nazis!Have you ever heard "The Tragedy of Darth Plagueis the Wise?"
A karenski?
So was the driver just supposed to sit there and let them destroy his car and possibly get the shit beat out of him!?
True that they are brave, not true that the Israeli state won‚Äôt do anything to them. The new coalition in Israel is extremely far-right and they just passed a law that allows them to arrest anyone that ‚Äúhurts morale‚Äù. Facism always turn inwards and starts coming after members of the ‚Äúin-group‚Äù eventually.

You can be surprised by how ill informed some people can be. My neighbor thought that New Jersey was a CITY.
Why did Israel killed 97 kids in west bank? There‚Äôs no hamas in west bank
So one side is sad casualties and other is on purpose?
Ya but that's his target they say hamas in there bomb it like I said they should make kids leave
Why did Israel bombed civilians who were evacuating to northern gaza in Palestine after being told by Israel and killed 70 kids?
And civilians get killed in war sucks but hamas was killing on purpose just cause they were Jewish
Person flying jet‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt know there are kids in building they are dropping bombs on?
Hamas told them they can't leave
Him being a petty criminal is irrelevant when police are exploiting their power to selectively enforce laws.
Nope, kids are just sad casualties. Jets can't see kids just building there told to hit hamas tortured people killed who ever
When they left after being told to evacuate northern Gaza of Palestine , why did Israel bombed those civilians and killed kids?
Ya, but they were told to leave, and if hamas cared for the kids, they would make them leave
There is absolutely no way they wouldn‚Äôt have a clue what it meant.
That‚Äôs why Israel killing kids in Gaza for revenge?
Doesn‚Äôt Israel know civilians live in buildings they are bombing and kids will be killed from their bombs?
Especially if you're elderly like that gentleman was
O ya and killed a bunch of younger people doing nothing but having fun they had no weapons 260 dead for no reason in one spot for what just cause there Jewish.
And a chant that doesn't sound like a middle school cheer squad came up with it.
What version of free Palestine are they demanding. Is it Israel just leaves them alone and a two state solution? Is it a everyone gets the same rights one state solution? Is it Israel ceases to exist and the ‚Äúcolonizers‚Äù must leave?There are very large differences between these visions of a free Palestine. None of which are simply a ceasefire. So i think it‚Äôs fair to ask what exactly is being demanded.
Not on purpose, there bombing hamas targets, and hamas uses kids to hide. That's why they told them to stay, don't leave if they cared they would hide them and don't forget they took hostages killed American citizens also and cheering for dead isreal women.jets can't see kids just targets buildings hamas killed kids with their own hands.
Hey, they see it working, why not?
We just loathe your flashy ways Guess that's why Gaza's broke and Nikki so paid.Come back Nikki come back
Israel is not bombing Palestinian kids?
Yes, I believe forbids that.
You ever see the truck driver during the Rodney king riots?  Beat for no reason other then the idiots rioting
Before, isreal dropped a bomb, they said, and others that hamas will start showing dead children to gain support from people like you're seeing and hearing its in their handbook literally lookbit up and shows how to execute hostages and take some they use kids to stop them from being wiped out if they cared for them they get them to safety not live with them.
They know that force will be used against them as well. Netanyahu is a fascist and he was trying to take total control before the war
Like 5 days before the attack there‚Äôs videos of Jews spitting on Christian‚Äôs in Israel‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre the shit stirrers. Always been.

You have to kite the tank from long range before they get close.

There‚Äôs another video of the passenger side window before the car turns, It‚Äôs a senior citizen, he looks extremely panicked because he‚Äôs surrounded and angry people are smashing his car.
Did anyone else think that there was no camera attached to it

No YOU don't, we all can see your comments.You're here to defend fascism, and you're trying to come up with any excuse to try and justify what they're doing, ANY excuse at all.
&gt;made me feel ashamed of myself to be an IndianYeah, I think you probably did that on your own.
 Straight outta cod mission
Propaganda with dead child clip? Explain
Surprise, surprise. I'm really tired of war and hate all around.. Fuck this world we live on with a bunch of idiot humans..
They really could have used more protesters with better vocal timbre.
Real curious what part of the world this is? Anybody know?
I mean wouldn‚Äôt the car always win?
Don't think a drone would work as well. The trick here is everything falls at approximately the same rate
Disgusting to know Israeli soldiers raped children
Is that where this is?
No shit. Where‚Äôs the fucking police Minnesota you losers.
Just had a tooth pulled so I‚Äôm drinking a shake in a very awkward position and just spewed chocolate meal replacement shake all over my kitchen from this comment.

"Society"
For zealot Christians, it's the other way around.  Jews in Israel first, Messiah second
welcome to the 2020s
I saw zero brutality.  I saw guys in hats crowd a uniformed officer and knock him down twice.  In America that would have led to a justified shooting.
What is the charge? Eating a meal? A succulent Kosher meal?
Absolutely.  It's land theft from Palestinians by brutal means
The zionist machine even punishes Jewish people in Israel for standing up against the apartheid
Those people protesting are some of the most vile people out there. When I visited Israel they spat at me and my family and I still dont know why
Oh yeah, bright idea, let‚Äôs impede and block the flow of traffic, that will get people to support our cause
I fear for the day I see a video posted of someone on a motorcycle and not a car‚Ä¶ they‚Äôll get torn to shreds
There's a lot of Jewish people who know what's happening to the Palestinians is completely f'd up.Everyone just has to keep up the noise
At 2:12 you can hear a gunshot and people run and scream
Most people outside of America/Canada know this already
Yeah it‚Äôs pretty fucked up but I automatically thought that because they‚Äôre dressed up as orthodox, they‚Äôd be Zionist. Clearly not the case
Stupidest comment I've read in ages.
This seems to be the case with every rally video I've seen the last few years. People just itching for anything, any reason to incite violence.  The timeline we're all on fucking sucks. People fucking suck. Wars suck. Genocide sucks. Guess what starts all of it? Humans... we suck as a species.Edit: cant believe I need to for clarify, imagine, protesting a violent war against innocent civilians,  using violence against innocent civilians. Fighting fire with more fire. Ignorant barbaric logic... And to the weirdos in my dms, you're all a part of the problem. I'm getting threatening pms about my lack of support for either side. LOL. Get fucked
haha I love this. Whenever I see videos like this I imagine a news reporter saying in a professional tone "in local news today, Man fights car. The winner is at this moment currently undecided but experts are predicting the odds are in fact in favour of the car"
Fuckin piece of shits need to get out of the road!
This is something straight out of Family Guy
I haven‚Äôt done even studying or research on the past to really comment on how they have changed from then to now but I can give my perspective on the changes I‚Äôve seen in my lifetime ( I‚Äôm 30) . Well to keep it simple , conservatives and liberals actually share the same values if you stick to the definitions of the words themselves . Liberalism1. willingness to respect or accept behaviour or opinions different from one's own; openness to new ideas.2.a political and social philosophy that promotes individual rights, civil liberties, democracy, and free enterprise.Conservatism 1.commitment to traditional values and ideas with opposition to change or innovation.2.the holding of political views that favor free enterprise, private ownership, and socially traditional ideas.If you look at it by the those definitions , we are rather the same minus the opposition to change or innovation because it‚Äôs 2023 , we all love innovation and change up to a degree for conservatives on the basis of the LGBTQ argument , mainly the T. At least I would say the T for me being a conservative because you can‚Äôt change genders and anyone who wants too I think they personally suffer from some mental health issues. The traditional values of being a conservative is liberalism by definition. But what you see on the democrat side is them preaching liberalism but not executing them properly and ultimately discriminating against someone which is going against their definition of not accepting . They always have to find someone or something to be the oppressor or oppressed so they can blame them.I dont know if that answers your question. And tbh I‚Äôm not the best at putting it all in words that best coherently explains it .
The world needs to see this. To show exactly what the Israeli government is doing. Anyone who isn‚Äôt a Zionist is systematically being erased.
Ah another video lacking total context that redditors will all believe. Nice.
And have views independent of the state powers? Outrageous!/s
Same with an intruder in your home
They are occupying already occupied land to protest what they think is an occupation. Most of them are probably unemployed and don't have occupations themselves.
Hamas only "represents" Gaza...the Palestian Authority governs the West Bank.  A simple google search would verify that...
the fucking guy just wanted to slowly go through im assuming, he didnt put the car in park so it rolled forward, he didnt hit anyone, he actually waited (if he drove in to them it woulda been self defense 100% since they were puching him and choke locking him)  the funniest shit is them reading his license plate like he did something.  this is making the rally people look bad.
Read up on the history of pacificists and consciousness objectors during war time and this is hardly surprising.  Society really puts the screws to people who don't go along with the program.
Maybe they were born there
that seemed a little bit uncalled for
Maybe I‚Äôm getting old but protesting like this really looks like the most negative to a cause crap ever.
This makes me want to live in a cabin in the middle of nowhere. The world has gone to shit.
You see they brought spares just for this eventuality
You‚Äôre right. Because every stupid thing you comment is making me dumber just by reading it. Get fucked Zionist.
Ah good, let's kill them all to show them all our rights! Fucking bent logic
I think thats the first time I've seen a "In soviet Russia Y does X" joke and thought it was clever
Yet they seem more than happy to stay behind the walls and be protected by the IDF which they (mostly) refuse to serve in.
The poor kids on the other side of the fence even made you some rockets‚Ä¶
How people can still support the Palestinians at this point is beyond me. They and their supporters lost any credibility
I wonder what would happen if you just come out and start yelling free Palestine! Free Palestine!Would the frenzy stop?
I expected them to like ride on their bikes and hit her with the back of the wheel while doing a trick but this is crazy too
ACAB
‚ÄúFlying drones over people are dangerous‚Äù nah it looks like driving a car near them are way more dangerous lol
More hamas propaganda
So we got "don't film me" despite being in a public place, then we got her instigating shit to riders that are just riding in a public place to which they respond by oh no, how dare they, braking in front of her, and lastly we got shit-talking that she escalated to following someone who was leaving.. To obviously fight with them or assault them... Which turns into a bike into the face.   No, I'd say this went fairly evenly. If you disagree it's probably because you're spending your time on Reddit drooling on yourself and licking boots instead of actually riding or standing up for yourself
Fairfax is the top ones.
They do it a lot here! That intersection is easily one of the busiest in the city.
No confirmation on this video .
She wanted to get into the shit, she found the shit.
Fuck Hamas and any of the people who support those terrorists
That took ball of steel.
ACAB
its hard to be a karen in russia
They aren't thinking. And I think the responding officer had no clue what it meant.
She got two tired.
"That wasn't a fart" -Dad Tzu
They're not protesting the abstract of violence. They're protesting a single instance of violence. They're ok with other violence.
BMX is gonna give it to ya!
I came here for this comment, take my upvote
It looks more like the police were trying to stop that guy from getting mobbed.
No I appreciate you educating me on it. Your points make total sense and definitely a confusing twist for a non-American. These days the narrative is definitely opposite of what you said it used to be in the past which is another really interesting point. So follow up question for you, do you think that the sides have shifted greatly in their views in terms of progressive liberalism vs conservative values over time? Like would you say the democratic party and the republican parties are very different today than they were before?
I love how feisty these guys are. They‚Äôre wearing these long overcoats and big hats and just not backing down at all!
To the complete idiots who attacked the old man in the car, congratulations! You've completely undermined your protest and credibility with your actions. Attacking and hindering the general population does not help in any way, shape, or form.
Gotta admire their authenticity
What a country
those are Haredi Jews. they don't believe Israel to be legite, not until the messiah returns, or something like that. once called ultra-orthodox. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredi\_Judaism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haredi_Judaism)
Driver may have tried to slowly push through the crowd and they didn't like that.  Car starts the video already with a crowd of people behind him, then he keeps driving and someone kicks the door a couple of times, then the driver gets out, forgets to put the car in park so it keeps going, and that's when the crowd turns on him.
Never stop for a crowd of Middle Eastern extremists.
I apologize for being calling you dumb because you were honest . Yea your American history was wrong lol. I‚Äôd stay away from labeling anything left wing or right wing because everything is manipulated to fit either sides narrative . Slavery been going on for thousands of years , so it‚Äôs not just an American issue. Democrats founded the KKK and have more ties to slavery than republicans , the president who freed the slaves was actually Abe Lincoln , a republican. Todays racists are more the liberals , of course their are racists in every category. At least your someone who admits when their wrong and I respect that. Everyone makes mistakes , especially myself , but just try researching the facts before posting because you know someone is going to ‚Äú fact check it‚Äù now a days .
Always a tyrant. Always.
Interesting is that another generalized statement based on my specific action?
I live rent free in your brain.
At a certain point, religion has nothing to do about it
What‚Äôs funny is you literally generalized on your response.&gt; Generalizing everyone in a group is just a weak way to think and if you want change in this world it starts with you. That‚Äôs you making a general or broad statement by inferring from specific cases.You took an action that is broadly done for a wide range of reasons and effectiveness and generalized it down to one type of action with one type of effect based on a specific type of case.Any thoughts?
üóø Isn't this supposed to be a peace rally, who would support you if you're this kinda POS.
üòÇ
They're the only ones brave enough to stand up to Israel because they know they're so Jewish there's nothing their country could reasonably even do about them.
How to get people to hate your cause 101
democracy manischevtz
What an amazing way ro get people to support you.  It hasnt worked... ever.
Oh i guess that explains all the cars hamas is blowing up! Force the israeli's to free them.
Protesting violence with violence is a wild paradox
"Why does nobody want to listen to us?"Go protest at the MN capitol or in DC. What do random people driving to work or home have to do with what is happening in Palestine? You're just creating inconveniences for people with no power to make whatever change you're looking for. Not mention I'm convinced a good chunk of these people aren't really there for the cause, but are there just waiting to create chaos.
I thought they would just do a stunt or something nearby to kind of razz her
I was about to comment that too. Always hate to be the buzzkill in the comments for videos like this, but flying drones over people is dangerous. Heck, the process for me (a licensed commercial drone operator) to fly over a crowd one time involves so much planning, paperwork, reviews, and approval from the FAA. It can be a 3 month process to do a 10 minute flyover for a specific shot.
So the cops intervened when he pulled a gun to defend himself against 4-5 people beating him up, ok. Why he even get out the car tho?
And the answer is yes
Exactly, more info is needed BEFORE the escalation.
People that do this regardless of affiliation don't know who Sun Tzu is, what he wrote, how to read, or capable of critical thinking.
The people they trapped weren‚Äôt pro anything other than running their errands and getting home at the end.
How someone could be Anti-Zionist Jews if they live in Israel?  Arab Jew?
https://nationallegalservice.co.uk/uk-protest-rights/"Do I need permission to protest?You do not need to have permission to protest unless you are the organiser."Britain is not a democracy either.
Not Zionist. Also, I couldn‚Äôt say they are hero‚Äôs.
Answers to what? You vocally expressed that people need permission to protest. Which highlights your idiocy regarding what qualifies as a protest, and then outed your fascist leaning by saying folks need permission to protest. My brother and christ I get you like licking boots but you ain't suppose to deepthroat the damn thing.
It‚Äôs a bit of a roller coaster‚Ä¶
Don‚Äôt crowd a tiger into a corner
I hate that this has elements of truth.
ü§£ü§£ü§£
All you guys do is trying to shit talk me instead of giving good answers. Bad news, i dont give a fuck what ignorant "people" on reddit call me.
You posting stupid shit made you more of an idiot then anyone on this website can even hope too.
W.
Son Lux is goated.
Instead of giving me a stupid answer go ahead and counter it.Edit: calling me stupid isn't making you any smarter.
They also instigated the interaction, see how the first kid brakes in her face. Even if she verbally overreacted they are definitely in the wrong.
TIL all muslim countries ban protests! Are you that dumb to believe that?
This is the worse understanding of what is going on in isreal. You missed 90 percent of the history events that has lead us here today. This is garbage.
You are right, my point was dumb. I'm actually not American and didn't study American history so I should have not even bothered adding my take on there. I meant that they were freedom fighters who would be seen as terrorists by the British. The stance on them being right-wing because I was linking them to civil rights issues like slavery would also be a confusingly wierd stance to take and prolly playing off the "conservative right wing folk are racists" trope. Good stuff calling me out on it! I shall research more on American history before speaking on it.
Well, obviously, if people are forced to stop driving, they're gonna get out of their cars and go free Palestine.
I don't know Minnesota state law, but generally defense of self claims are some level of (1) The defense was a response to an unprovoked attack, (2) the person reasonably believed they were in danger of bodily harm at the time, and (3) the response was reasonable in terms of force, and did not escalate the level of danger.
Welcome to democracy then.
Thats not freedom. Which is the point. You either understand what it means to be free or have the freedom to do something or you don't
That was a BMX IED.
Hero's, is why we need to make a distinction between zionists and those of Jewish faith.
Again, if you want to organize a protest you need a permit, this exists in most democratic countries, feel free to check it out yourself.
Do they think anyone who can ACTUALLY HELP the situation is in one of those cars? It‚Äôs ridiculous, let‚Äôs inconvenience random people who are just trying to live their lives. Yeah I‚Äôm sure the people you‚Äôve pissed off are totally going to support your cause now‚Ä¶
1000 angry people.
You just said you keep a permit? If you need permit then you aren't free to protest. It doesn't matter that they have allowed it. You aren't free to do it if your need a permit
There sure are.  Don‚Äôt try to attack people in their cars:https://www.foxnews.com/us/iowa-man-found-not-guilty-riving-crowd-anti-abortion-protesters-effort-protect-family.amphttps://ktul.com/amp/news/local/no-charges-in-i-244-truck-incident-with-protesters
Protests by randos in Minneapolis are actually the solution for the conflict in the middle east. Very rude they are doing it only now. I hope the citicens of Milwaukee get off their asses and take a walk to stop the Ukraine war soon.
Much more rights than in muslim countries.
Watch the news of israel from the past9 months. You are allowed to protest against the government. The protest in the video was against enlisting into the army. Dunno where you got the context that it was against the government.
"we are not our ancestors"
FYI....Due to the root word Semite, the term is prone to being invoked as a misnomer by those who interpret it as referring to racist hatred directed at all "Semitic people" (i.e., those who speak Semitic languages, such as Arabs, Assyrians, and Arameans). This usage is erroneous; the compound word antisemitismus (lit.‚Äâ'antisemitism') was first used in print in Germany in 1879 as a "scientific-sounding term" for Judenhass (lit.‚Äâ'Jew-hatred'), and it has since been used to refer to anti-Jewish sentiment alone.
Lmaoü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüòÇ
Atleast you're allowed to protest in israel unlike most muslim countries, stop being so fucking ignorant.
Hahahahaha
Why are you recycling older posts?
Israel is a western democracy, more like the us than not
üòÇ love it, a Karen in every country
They are but that drone flew against FAA regulations for flying over people.
What absolute cowards.
It's hard to tell from this footage, but they're already behind him. Impossible to know what's going through his mind, but they appear very quick to kick at his car for slightly moving forward. Then he gets out in a huff without putting in park. Honest mistake. Dude's heated and probably a little scared. Mob mentality has them swarm. Now he's got no idea what to do so he moves ahead. I'm pretty liberal in the sense that I believe that protests in the street are fine by me, and even that protesters should be able to defend themselves against angry motorists, but that's not what's happening here. Idiots shouldn't be surrounding cars that are already blockaded.
Fuck hamas
That's not being free to protest. If you need a permit from the government to protest the government, then you aren't free to protest.How do you not understand that?
"Their" space being the place where cars live.
And all of this in the name of religion. All sides fighting to the death to prove their gods are more peaceful and loving.
What in the mission impossible ü§£Been a minute since I see this, it's always fucking crazy. Glad everyone survived!
Protesting for "humanitarian aid" while literally blocking access to the county's largest hospital.
Lmao you dumb as shit . There wasn‚Äôt a left or right back then . The founding fathers were federalists . 1820 is when the republicans and democrats we‚Äôre created in a two party system. Confederate leaders established the confederate party in 1861 in which most of them were democrats . Northern democrats were split between supporting Abe Lincoln in the war and the copperheads who opposed it . There haven‚Äôt been liberals in power to support anything else you claimed.Congratulations on failing American history .
I was literally on my way to comment this is World War Z with those mfs chasing the car. Shambling is a good word
K is for killing yourself because you wanted internet validations!

You fascist scums always surprise me
Their mask is slipping, the world is getting a glimpse of their true nature
Also I‚Äôve heard people were harassed on there way into the event which isn‚Äôt cool.

I was saying that they weren‚Äôt from the area and you appear to be saying the same thing.
Unfortunately there are definitely chuds in the dc area due to the high military/government population, but even the republicans here are kinda liberal. Think John McCain lovers not Trump supporters lol. On the upside it‚Äôs a diverse area with a decently young population so it‚Äôs easy to avoid the chuds :) Also the streets are clean! Good luck with your move and I hope you enjoy your time here!
They‚Äôre big on the constitution. They don‚Äôt have to, they don‚Äôt want to.
You're telling me the little child being bombed every day doesn't suddenly feel better when random people decide to take an hour out of their day to protest?/s
People who block the road deserve whatever happens.  Definitely don't win people over to their side of whatever cause they're advocating for . . . .
Lets say he hears that "shoot him" and thinks he sees someone reaching for something... Especially in a situation like this can create combat stress  of fight or flight. He could have just ran people over because of the situation they created around the car. People are absolutely stupid.
You'd think a race of people put into concentration camps wouldn't be about putting people in concentration camps.
It was one person who raped a girl , I wouldn‚Äôt say they.
Can you link it please?
It says it in the articles. They were going to protest the rally downtown and they canceled that one because the organizers were afraid due to threats and moved it to the one in Skokie. It‚Äôs in every news report about this.
Great point
Got to make it dramatic for the camera .
Have those good cops ever testified against another sworn officer or would have been willing too? just curious
They know, they relish in playing the victim and telling their wives that there is a war on cops.
You misunderstand the concept of ACAB. It doesn‚Äôt matter if or how many seemingly or actually good cops you know. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many cops you‚Äôve seen walk an old lady across the street or how many kittens in trees they‚Äôve saved. It doesn‚Äôt matter how many cops you‚Äôve seen shooting jumpshots on a sidewalk basketball hoop with neighborhood kids. It doesn‚Äôt matter whether or not a particular cop has good intentions and says they want to make the world a better place. The police don‚Äôt have a choice whether or not they and their job have been bastardized by the broken and oppressive system they work to uphold. Being a bastard is an inherent quality of being a police officer in America and they have no choice in the matter. It‚Äôs not possible to be a cop and not be a bastard. They are necessarily complicit by means of simply participating. Does this mean that every cop and the entirety of their being is ‚Äúbad‚Äù? No. When people say this, they‚Äôre not all claiming every ounce of their being is ‚Äúbad‚Äù. They‚Äôre speaking to them being police officers and what that means in this context.

Okay but like they threw a fucking bike at her face You should be concerned that this is your takeaway IMO. This shit literally didn't matter, she was just saying words. So easy to ignore, or worst case just move on and come back in 20 minutes.
YES EXACTLY! And I heard some woman in the video yell "shoot him" could be misheard, but if that wasn't a mishearing, really makes you think who is even more in the wrong and who's even further towards the right. I sympathize the driver here more than anyone in the video
I feel like I watched a clip of a judge ruling in favor of the person in the vehicle in the fairly recent past.
Is how you get to pilot to dive with you
This is like the guy that threw the shopping cart at lady in home depot
Even worse because they are throwing objects at the car, opening the door/ make more attempts, kicking, yelling, physically threating gestures. Driver has all right to protect himself but is smarter then to lower himself to their level. Poor guy.Fight for your right but acting like a moron makes people hate your cause. You wont get any sympathy.
thanks
I mean, that is main character vibes. And I'm assuming she said something threatening as she walked up to him. However throwing a whole BMX bike at someone is wild asf
No not really. It‚Äôs more like Israel shouldn‚Äôt exist UNTIL the messiah returns. It‚Äôs a bit odd that many of them live in Israel despite this but they‚Äôre not particularly apposed to Palestinians being killed, more that the timing is off. I‚Äôm over simplifying but it would take to long to explain. They consider the Israeli government to be atheistic as well which is another point of contention for them. They also enjoy comparing the Israeli government to the Nazi regime.
Sun Tzu said to always leave an opponent a way to flee unless you want to see how hard he can fight.
Both planes here fucked up, the plane in front needs to follow the course and be predictable but the plane behind should be paying attention to the first in case it needs to change course.
Thanks for the info! I grew up in suburban NY until I was 11, so I have a soft spot for quaint suburban living (and also an irrational hatred of dirty streets- I live in Philly now and ü§¢) but also don't want to pay sky-high taxes or be surrounded by chuds like my parents did/were. I got strong chud vibes from "Police Week" so was thinking "*please* don't tell me it's exactly like where I grew up" (although I suppose there are chuds literally everywhere in the US).
Source?
Life imitates art.
What happened 10 seconds prior?
I've always wondered what they hope to accomplish by blocking the road entirely. It has such a high chance of ending in injury, either to the protesters or to a driver. Block off all but one lane if you really feel the need to. Drivers can still get through, but will be inconvenienced so that you still get your point across. Ultimately, I'd prefer they don't block roads at all though.
The world is witnessing the genocide of the Palestinian people in real time. It‚Äôs astonishing after seeing videos and photos like this, knowing the Israeli military are deliberately targeting and bombing innocent civilians including residential buildings with entire families inside, schools, paramedics and even journalists to try and cover up all these war crimes that people still want to justify and stand by these massacres. Humanity is lost.
Literally that‚Äôs what the report said just formation flying and the lower plane fucked up is all. No stunt was intended or attempted just pilot error trying to climb and see the other aircraft
Karenski
Violence is not the answer‚Ä¶..it is the question
These protests are pointless anyway. They only serve the protesters by making them feel good. No one on the other side of the world gives a fuck about what happens in Minneapolis.
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA savage!
One would even argue that preventing this kind of protest is not suppression of freedom of speech. If I remember correctly, Amendment 1.4 states, "the right of the people to peaceably assemble," so while protesting is a time-honored practice in the US, the operative word is "peaceably." The US Supreme Court has noted that a protest can be shut down if it is associated with "violence and intimidation." Further more, the government can regulate the time, place, and manner in which a protest is conducted. What happened just now was inciting violence and intimidation. Hell, last I checked, most if not all local and state governments make it illegal to block traffic as it can cause damage to emergency frontline workers such as paramedics, firemen, and policemen. Most jurisdictions in general consider obstruction of traffic an illegal activity. The First Amendment does not supersede the law as stated numerous times by USSC
Tf is there end goal by attacking a random car like that?
The behaviour of all these pro palestine people really does the opposite of what they want to achieve
They were definitely from outside the community because they moved their protest from a different location.
I know you gave it quotations for a reason but lmfao at their space being a public highway. What an unforseeable infringement!
For real, I wanna know why some people in the video thought it'd be okay to throw shit at the car? Like my brother in christ, maybe the dude was lost, the driver didn't seem to want to cause harm to anyone, it really seemed like they weren't aware of what was going on and were scared. Like the protestors are clearly in the wrong, any protestor shouldn't be protesting I the street, or in this case, the highway, this is just impeding traffic and messing with people's normal lives. It's one thing for the city to hold like a parade, but it's another thing for an unregistered event group to use their own cars to block off the road...Driver is not at fault in my book from the video. He just wanted to leave. He was fleeing, and he didn't come back around and hit people. Seemed like the protestors, on the other hand, were running after him to cause him harm after fleeing, fucking POS's
I wanna ID his English teachers. Breath ‚â† Breathe
But how is it brain dead? Explain. I don‚Äôt believe all cops do that. Please provide evidence to support every cop in America abuses their power.
I‚Äôm pretty sure commercial airplanes fly too high to jump from
That old dude had the patience of a saint‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd be making a lot of these people into speed bumps as soon as they started surrounding my car like that
If you block a road in the name of a protest for shit that's not something happening locally go fuck yourself. If you want to march and have a peaceful protest in support of my overseas shit great do it on the side I walk I'll throw you a couple of bucks or read an article about it. None of those people can do shit about Palestine or Isreal get out of the road idiots.
These losers are so unbelievably lucky he didn‚Äôt just floor it and run them over.
The footage that comes out of Minneapolis never siezes to amaze me.
Yeah I saw the video of a closet view inside of the car that fled, the dude driving looked old and very confused, absolutely terrible people ‚òπÔ∏è
&gt; slowly creeps forward into an empty space OMG He was trying to run us over!!! Looks like they were waiting on the slightest infringement on ‚Äútheir‚Äù space to exact some sort of violence.
Their just angry it's not God letting them die. They aren't opposed to violence they just want genocide in a different way.
What is the point of doing that? What do they hope to accomplish?
Nothing makes me hate a cause more than blocking traffic. I don't care if this is the "raise money so Dave can get to the strip club" protest. DON'T BLOCK THE FUCKING ROAD.
This seems like a hell of a good way to get people to support Israel. Idk man it's just fucking wild seeing this shit from people 18-25 like dude you have no fucking idea what's going on you just wanted to go out and shoot some footage for your socials. Fuck hafe of them can not show me right now Palestine on a map.
Yeah, amazing self control that he didn't do that the minute they opened the door.
I think the difference is this:With the white supremacists 45 years ago, you had a contingent of people traveling to a location to be explicitly antisemitic.In the instance of a pro-Palestinian gathering; given what I had laid out previously regarding American Jewish sentiment toward Israel, I don't think you can make the same assumption that the people here are from outside the community, nor can you make the assumption that the individual arriving with the firearm is from outside the community.More than anything, I would probably guess that many communities with large Jewish populations are in a very concerned; paranoid even, state.  Same as those with large Arab/Muslim populations, as Americans are pretty bad with nuance.  The last 8-10 years have been the worst this country has been with Antisemitic AND Anti-Arab sentiment since 9/11, and the current state of discourse has only exacerbated this.
A crazy person who is scared is in a 4,000 lb metal moving object, and your first instinct is to stand in front of that 4,000 lb metal moving object? Maybe we need it to re-examine the definition of crazy here.
You have the right to protest, however, you do not have the right to disrupt everybody elses lives. I'm sure that in Palestinian communities they would not take kindly to protests and disruptive behavior to protest Hamas killing of 1400 civillians.
Just stupid, stupid people.
These motherfuckers constantly cry about not being liked. BLUE LIVES MATTER is the best example of that.
Or throwing their flags as he drove by
Terrorizing local residents now too?
Still Nazis. But the claim in question isn't that all cops are bad, the claim by you was there are good cops. And you're asking me to do the leg work. Can you provide examples of cops that have changed department policy to increase oversight and accountability? Because my specific claim is that anyone who sees these issues, joins the force, and doesn't do that is bad. You could also explain why it isn't bad to not have police accountability if you want to counter the claim.
We want peace!!!!
The non Palestinians in that crowd looks exactly how I imagined them to
Yea let‚Äôs harass our neighbors just going about their lives and have f*** all to do with things going on across the world üëçüèª.
Especially against women
It's Russia, violence is always the first option
Is it like "Israel needs to be destroyed for the messiah to arrive"?
Those are kids. I fucking hate religion
The person who makes the claim that all cops are bad has the burden of proof. Please do a google search and see how many cops have spoken out. But the question is, how can anyone prove that every single cop in the US is a bad cop? People don‚Äôt only choose to be cops so they can abuse authority. There are many reasons. Yeah Nazi‚Äôs are bad. You can make that claim and probably no one will argue. But what about those Nazi‚Äôs who tried to kill Hitler? What about those Nazi‚Äôs the joined the party because they had a family to feed but did not agree with the Nazi ideology? What about the wife‚Äôs who stood by their husbands who were Nazi‚Äôs or their children. No  one ever likes to get into the weeds when they are judging but people are complicated. I believe allowing people to generalize groups of people and ignore the complexities is misguided.
Don‚Äôt block roads with your body. Metal is stronger than flesh. Pretty simple
A few bad apples spoil the whole bunch, guess what we are way beyond the "few bad apples part.
You're not gonna believe this, but he was also wearing a parachute and survived.
How many "bad cops' has your "good cop" friend turned in? How many times have they turned a blind eye while a bad cop beat someone up for no reason? How many other officers have they defended?
Cops is not ‚Äúa people‚Äù. Cops is an occupation. People are mad at them because they are bad at their jobs.
Lol ya got me what an embarrassing typo.  But in seriousness that‚Äôs some bad flying he‚Äôs not looking at his instruments and one of those pilots isn‚Äôt mean to be on that flight path
This is the most brain dead comparison I‚Äôve ever heard. Cops literally exercise power over people and kill with impunity, and some people say negative things about cop‚Äôs abusing their power. There is no symmetry in that situation. All cops have to do is stop abusing people and the ‚Äúhostility‚Äù towards cops would stop.
Trying to figure out what a protest in Minneapolis does to help anything. It‚Äôs not even raising awareness, it‚Äôs just annoying
How did that person not run everyone over?
Hamas rally.
Why? Why are they attacking cars for being where cars are supposed to be? These people didn't drive there in support of Israel or anything. This doesn't make any sense
When *not* pilot
I support a protest or rally if it‚Äôs a good cause but blacking traffic and threatening people is just wrong and it piss me the fck off like cmon people get the fck off the road.
&gt;I think everyone should remind themselves that being critical of Israel is not the same as being Anti-Semetic.I agree, but when a large group specifically travels to a place with an abnormally large concentration of Jews to protest against Israel, I think we should feel comfortable about questioning their intentions. As you stated yourself, many Jews are anti-Israel, so even the practice of connecting American Jews to Israel is kinda suspect.
Do we know if a judge would agree? Any former cases to go by?
what a bunch of clowns
If I was the jury I would vote that he‚Äôs not guilty
You're being overly charitable to suggest he thinks.
You can jump off some pretty high shit into quite shallow water if you do it right. Grew up like 10 min from an awesome river with waterfalls n shit. One place we use to jump from was about 30 feet high and the water was only neck Deep. If you shoot out just right as soon as you hit, you could just barely bonk your ass off the rock bottom.  Us locals that grew up there could do some wild shit that usually fucked other out of town people up. We knew the river like it was our living room. You can go over the falls head first, one place, move 5 feet to either side and your goose is broiled. We had to stop many a people from doing what we were doing so they didn't die. I would always go in and check the jump spots first since you never know what changed in the river since last time. While I've never tried it, I always operated under the assumption that the high-speed insertion of a ragged pine skewer up my ass was something that wouldn't make my day more enjoyable.
The goal of every union is to make work conditions more favorable for the employees. So it makes sense police unions would advocate to protect LE. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs right, it is what it is. The difference is most unions and cop unions are that the imbalance of power lies with the police. I am just concerned about this rhetoric honestly. If we are learning anything from this Israeli/Palestine war is that unrestrained hatred only leads to death, destruction, and suffering. The Israelis and the Palestinians have hated each other for so long that it is impossible for them to come to any resolution. And the worse case scenario is that the whole world gets dragged into a world war. So yes, if you say all cops are bad, I feel like that is an unreasonable statement. Anytime someone devalues someone‚Äôs humanity, it should be a concern.
I know the smug bigots in this thread are eager to dunk on this person, but is it any mystery why LGBT people would be upset at Israel for murdering LGBT and children in Gaza?
Someone clearly yelled shoot him at 0:37
He's retired. I work for an arm of the justice department. We have officers and our job is to go after corporate scammers. He's an investigator and seems like a really nice person. I'm technically an officer too but my job is to help with information technology related issues.I think what the cop did in ops post is appalling and frankly should be fired. You want to point and blame, blame whoever hired him.Generalizing everyone in a group is just a weak way to think and if you want change in this world it starts with you. I'm not accusing you of generalizing either. I'm just saying, you can't advocate for change if you aren't willing to do.the thing you're advocating for. Prejudice, racism etc... those are just forms of generalization.
I‚Äôve seen examples of hostile driving at protests (Charlottesville being the obvious case). This isn‚Äôt one of them.
Working for Uber is flexible bruv lol
I live in Alexandria and it‚Äôs an absolutely lovely place to live. Friendly, walkable, and decently progressive (which has me curious what will happen to the cop in the video). A nice blend of urban and suburban vibes with lots of small businesses. I honestly can‚Äôt praise it enough lol I never want to leave
Why do you only fuck when pilot?
Now try it in FL
So we agree this isn‚Äôt a peaceful protest?
People are fucking idiotic.
This will definitely show Israel not to mess with Palestine, good work folks.
They trapped a bunch of people and then started attacking and damaging their cars. Then they are offended when people try to escape that situation. That‚Äôs insane.
It's almost as if some people want to get run over and die a martyr.
This demonstrates how screwed we are when our flying cars finally become a reality. Can't even avoid each-other when y'all the only two mfkers driving up there.
Really making people feel sorry for your cause by‚Ä¶wait what‚Äôs this? Assaulting an elderly man trying to go home in a country thousands of miles away from the conflict you‚Äôre literally doing nothing about but yelling at people who have nothing to do with it and can‚Äôt do anything about it? Wow super smart.
Hahahahahahaha, see, that is the thing, they won‚Äôt. Cops harassing you will NOT get them in trouble, unless it is beyond egregious. Constantly pulling you over to give you bullshit tickets, constantly stopping you to try and bombarding you with questions, the most minor offense they will jump on you for, etc. All ‚Äúlegal‚Äù, all won‚Äôt get them in trouble.
ü§£ü§£ü§£ this comment killed me
Well, Nazi Germany knew what Jews are, how they think and so on
I don't think that is necessarily the case.  From my understanding, some of the most outspoken pro-Palestinian people in this country are ethnically Jewish.  Not sure exactly why that is; some speculation is that they keep up with what is transpiring in the Israel/Palestine conflict more than your average American.Mainly though, I think people should be careful how they approach this entire situation, especially as we are likely to be far less knowledgeable about it; both currently and historically.More than anything else, I think everyone should remind themselves that being critical of Israel is not the same as being Anti-Semitic.  Same thing as being critical of Hamas is not the same as being anti-Palestinian.  There's so much blurring of the lines in the current discourse that we need to be more vigilant on how we are expressing our views.
You‚Äôre wrong, yes Hamas are a Muslim group resisting the Israelis who are the oppressors that are illegally occupying all of Palestine, for them to do that, they go on killing and tormenting the lives of every Palestinian regardless of their religion. So what about the West Bank, Hamas has no presence there but all the Christian and Muslim Palestinians who live there are also getting killed and tormented and more land and homes are stolen there from the cynical and evil Israeli military for no reason except to commit genocide.
Guy with the phone is just as Insufferable as the üê∑
Wtf are you talking about? They‚Äôre repeatedly yelling ‚Äústay off the street‚Äù and then ‚Äúdo not approach the car‚Äù?Did I miss something?
The Canadian Government needed to find a way to lower the wages and keep housing unaffordable as their priority.
The irony of having a Palestinian flag chucked at your car as you‚Äôre trying to run for your life.
If your protest involves blocking traffic, storming my vehicle and making me and other potential people in my car feel threatened just because I had the audacity to drive somewhere that day‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt care if we‚Äôre on the same team. I‚Äôm using any and all methods necessary to get the hell out of there.
If you're flying in formation the planes in the back follow the lead plane's movements not the other way round. Looks like they were trying to do a stunt that included the following plane to get closer and just fucked up bad.
Why did someone scream ‚Äúthey‚Äôre shooting‚Äù at the 2:10 mark
damn they really adopting the human shield strategy!
Right, for inherent characteristics for sure. But pigs choose to be pigs and abuse authority, it can absolutely be criticized. It's not a generalization to say Nazis are racist. Also, no names?
You mean the zionist and Orthodox jews ? What's the point you're trying to make here?
Pretty harsh.. savage to hit a middle aged woman in the face with a bike...
The first one but it correlates towards the second one.
I mostly just heard him say stay off the street and then not to approach the car at the end
I was waiting for him to floor it through the crowd
The irony is this is what was said about Jews by Nazi Germany. All these decades later their descendants act just as bad. Smh.
It's a vicious cycle.
The majority of US support for Israel comes from Christian Evangelicals.
I'm so happy for that driver that this video is out there now. The protesters are lucky that none of them died in their unprovoked attack on that vehicle. Especially since they escalated it further by chasing him with the intent to  cause physical harm.
Thank you for the response but it doesn‚Äôt really answer my question
Side note: the quality of shots here is amazing.
Didn't a truck barrel through one of Minneapolis's George Floyd highway blocking demos?  What is with people thinking that disrupting traffic causes change?
They were flying in formation and the plane below loss track of the plane above and was gaining altitude which caused them to crash.
Dude, they even called it a Holly war themselves, so you're wrong its coming from hamas sick fucks they don't attack civilians like scum bags then Gaza not getting bomb
What is this, World War Z? Why is the zombie army attacking that random car?

I can neither confirm or deny you may or may not be correct
Idc which side you‚Äôre on. If you‚Äôre blocking me you reap the consequences.
Maybe follow your own advice and stay out of the street and don‚Äôt approach cars????
Ooooooh
You work with a good one? Does he back up the bad ones? Because if he does...
ACAB
Agreed, they could have walked away or kept doing what they were doing but it's almost never ok to throw a bike at someone
It must be pretty freaky to be surrounded by 100 angry people like that
Hatred is wrong regardless of who you are hating. Making generalizations about human beings is wrong. It will always be wrong. The world would be a better place is people stopped hating.
Totally agree, I am not judging these people for the cause they are supporting, I just think the behavior is abhorrent. Violence and instilling fear is just not the way.
What exactly do you think cop unions advocate for? Protection from any kind of public accountability for their officers. That‚Äôs the entire point of the police union.
Yeah I always found that concept hilarious. "You're 'free' to protest as long as you have the permission from the authorities to protest!"What a joke, eh
That reminds me of another situation, on a larger scale, though.
Says the oppressor, you‚Äôre Wrong. This has nothing to do with religion. The murderous evil Israeli Zionist target and kill innocent Christians and Muslims alike, while bombing, Churches and mosques. This is nothing more than what the world now sees it to be, genocide of the Palestinian people. Always trying to make it about religion, the only one who make it about religion are the Criminal Israeli colonizers who admit to thinking that Palestine is the land for only Jews, the audacity to claim Palestinians are making about religion. The Palestinians have been resisting the illegal Israeli occupation of their land since 1948. The evil Zionists have been killing the Christians in Palestine too so what does that tell the world?? Go on with your lies.
I think that was Jimbo Jones who threw the bike.
they only want to behead you.  don't be islamophobic.
protest murder by killing someone ?
For sure. Some people are there with good intentions but there will always be people who show up just because they like mob violence. I watched it everyday, for 11 days/nights, out of my window in downtown Los Angeles with the George Floyd riots. When the sun went down, no more protest, it was chaos- rioting &amp; looting. That's why I always stay away from any protest, it's just too risky.
I actually want to move there after graduation (going to work in the political arena; lower cost of living than DC and quaint suburban vibes). In your opinion, is it worth it?
In Russia BMX rides you!
Speaker with the microphone is directly inciting violence.
Disgusting Zionist are so mad that the world is watching them get exposed for what they really are. The only terrorist are the disgusting, cowardly, evil Israeli military and their leaders. They are all criminal colonizers that came from the scums of Europe because they couldn‚Äôt survive there, no one liked them. Israeli is and has been committing genocide on the Palestinian people for the past 75 years. Like I said they fled from Europe because they were unwanted, so the British said send them to Palestine. Instead of being great full and living in peace, the Israeli monsters started killing Palestinians and stealing their land, now here we are today. Even after 75 years they can‚Äôt even get rid of the Palestinians. The Palestinians have strength and resilience more than anyone in this world. Not the spineless cowards Israelis who deliberately target innocent civilians and including women and children, too scared to take on Hamas head on. Give Hamas 1% of what weapons Israel has and the Israeli military would not last one day. Where is the fair fight? The Israeli military and their leaders are a bunch of scared little bitches massacre women and children and there is a special place in hell for people like that.
I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs illegal. You need a permit to do something like that, and usually in order to get a permit you need to have some kind of written safety plan or contract for security depending on expected size. But that takes time and money. Or, depending how you look at it, is a SuPrSsiOn of 1St amEndMeND RigHTs!!1!
Cops don't care. They have become more violent than ever and the government has given them free reign to do whatever they want to whomever they want.
Fallen law enforcement officer or rescue worker means: a law enforcement officer or correctional officer whose death arises out of and in the course of employmentSo those who were killed while ‚Äútaking reports‚Äù.  Who knew taking reports was so dangerous.
Idgaf what your 'cause' is. If you surround my car and threaten the safety of myself or family I will defend myself using any and all means available.
Blocking traffic with civilian vehicles and/or bodies without a permit? I don‚Äôt believe so.
&gt;Good and bad cops both benefit from police unions.All cops benefit because there are no good cops. Do you have an example of a cop that spoke out against this or pushed for accountability? Bonus points if they still have a job and/or their life.
I wonder if this an illegal protest with blocking off the road with personal vehicles.
Bunch of jobless losers making traffic worse lol
As they should can‚Äôt have terrorists openly walking around chanting for death of innocents
It just baffles me that people think they can crowd a car like this, there is no situation that warrants this. If you pin someone down you are forcing them to fight, they need to escape, they have a right to escape. And, hey, guess what? They‚Äôve got a ton of steel around them to push around, so maybe just leave it alone before people get really hurt.
Your spelling passes me off
![gif](giphy|bv3Oyx5PIUYbZeOPle)
You have the right to protest and rally but not threaten harm on others. He is terrified in the car from other video that was posted. Self-defense here if it happened would be justified. The people are lucky he was calm and reasonable. They should learn from that.
That's the problem with these events...many people are not "pro" anything, they are just terrible people looking for a reason to be terrible.
She didn‚Äôt deserve that.
Police Week and Rolling Thunder are the bane of the DC area.
Nearing the end I started to think "ain't no way this gets wild" but buddy really did go 0-100 real quick in the last couple seconds .
Smart. I'm wearing one on the Subway.
Acting like a toddler being forced to do something they don't want to.
So it's clear why these people came to this town to protest then. Sound like they're a bunch of antisemitic cunts.
No
There isn't any, actually. Can't even think of one as a native speaker.
^ Fascist describes fake ‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù If you don‚Äôt have this special paper, the police will beat you to a pulp. ü§∑what are rights
"Let's fuck up this old dude to protest the humanitarian crisis."
least racist cop etc etc
Being able to remove bad cops is a vital tool to have in a civilized society. However, even though the unions are pro all cops, it‚Äôs still doesn‚Äôt mean all cops are bad. Good and bad cops both benefit from police unions.
Politicians from both major parties in the US protect police unions and don‚Äôt want any kind of police accountability. There is also less of a social safety net in the US than there is in Germany, so crime is a natural outcome. Right wingers in the Republican party and wealthy liberals like Nancy Pelosi in the Democratic Party do not want any kind of social safety net, because that would involve taxing the wealthy. So they use police to punish poor people and keep them in line instead of trying to solve poverty. You will see wealthy liberals do goofy stuff like wearing a kente cloth and kneeling after George Floyd died, but they ultimately do not want to solve the root causes. They‚Äôll just act sad, give a thoughts and prayers and move on. Then there is the right wingers who are just racist psychos who love seeing police violence.
They should have giant parachutes for the planes as well. Like an air bag but for planes.

Like anyone gives a fuck about a Russian video.
Every police union in the country was die hard Trump because he was going to roll back the minor accountability reforms the Obama admin put in place. That was the first thing ‚Äúneo-confederate‚Äù Jeff Sessions did. Anytime a mild reform is going to be implemented or up for a vote, the police unions act like the sky is falling and lose their minds. The ‚Äúgood and bad apples‚Äù thing doesn‚Äôt work when the people who are supposed to be sorting through the apples make sure it is impossible to do and make sure the bad apples are not removed.
Really man there is no sound and nothing also people don‚Äôt just get used to sound they will still have normal reaction
Willing to bet 99% of those fatalities from 2020-2021 were from covid since most of those pigs are anti-vax.
They really want both
Kind of makes you wonder.. what the hell they are thinking?
Little bit of everything to be honest. I do teach but this isn't my subject of expertise.My main education besides discussions and news came from a really interested lecture I went to from a guy named Miko Peled. He is the son of of one of the most legendary Isreali generals named Matti Peled and he is also the grandson of the man who signed Isreals declaration of independence. When I heard him speak it was mindblowing because the things he spoke about I had never heard, his perspectives completely challenged current narratives. The guy is from one of the most prominent zionist families and is extremely pro palestine. Like when he describes ethnic cleansing of villages etc. the type of details he shares are very shocking.He has a book called the generals son if you are interested.So from there I started reading from other perspectives mainly being from Jewish professors actually. I mentioned some of the resources in some earlier comments.Some folk will try to add a bunch of things about Isreal being attacked when they were created or the 7 day war etc. But in a random reddit comment it's not really worth it to go into much detail there because those are more reactions of events not the cause. Untill the world actively wants to solve the cause in my opinion we will never have a solution.Right now the biggest tell tale that no one in the States is interested in a solution, is from looking at who they send for negotiations. Like the sent Blinken, the dude is a dual US- Isreali citizen. Why would the region that is pissed at Isreal take him seriously. The US government is filled with these dual citizens, google it. The public seems completely unaware though and will keep approving insane relief packages.
The good ones allow for the bad ones to exist, ergo they are also bad. Simple.
What's the Russian version of a Karen? Karenov?
Definitely agree with this statement. Bureaucracy surrounding law enforcement needs to be reformed but to suggest all LE are bad is not a fair statement to make. Every single job that is out there has good apples and bad apples.
That‚Äôs my point. They are Jewish, not Israeli. So this could be construed as antisemitism and not just a war protest. I can‚Äôt believe I have to spell this out in 2023.
I don‚Äôt like cops and this is in bad taste, but this guy is just as petty
That's it. Very fucking sad. But what the police did to the guy that filmed it was just abhorrent. I understand he was maybe a petty criminal, but he didn't deserve the harassment he got just for drawing attention to the situation
Wasn't necessary to start getting confrontational at them for filming either.
Nice. Dead terrorist. #free Israel
do any of these fucks have a job?
nice
In case no one says it, I get the reference.
Im familiar with the demographic, yes. Unfortunately, that doesn‚Äôt entitle anybody to isolation from protests, including against Israel (in which they don‚Äôt live, interestingly).
Yep now she's laying down because she got two tired.
2013?  That‚Äôs like 5 years from now.
Literal AI-generated Russian propaganda lol. But account as well OP?
riot tourists:  OMG We're freedom fighters!
ITT: "A few people (not the whole crowd) did this, so LGBT people should be okay with LGBT people and children being killed by Israel"
It's a religious attack on jews that's it nothing to do with land are freeing the Palestinians
I've met good cops. I work with one. Generalizing never leads to a good outcome, you know, like cops generalizing minorities?I agree that cops need to be more professional, better trained and more compassionate but generalizing the good ones with the bad ones just leads to more bad cops.
These people definitely want bad shit to happen, it's why they are blocking the road. They love it when she like this goes down, even better if it makes national headlines as it's better for they cause. They don't have jobs, so protesting is their job.
Idk, Rittenhouse said he wanted to shoot someone looting a shop a week prior and then went to the riots and shot someone.Edit: What are the downvotes? You don‚Äôt like facts?
Dude the man was literally in a chokehold
A boomer would film a vertical video horizontally
(definetly not talking to myself here. Definetly not)
Well glad he didn't smash his face on the way down. Still scarred from watching that shit
I dont mean to be argumentative but I think those values you mentioned are idealistic, though they are derived from objective universal moral truths. When it comes down to the cold hard reality, history showed us that Russian villages had to post signs in WW2 telling parents not to eat their children because the famine was so terrible. To sacrifice yourself for another, and to preserve innocent vulnerable lives during catastrophes are all idealistic. The world is out to get you killed... what is justice? And what creates it? Justice is to heal and remedy the sources which caused the trouble in the first place, from which the trouble sprang. Justice would be removing the conditions which are making others out to get you, and the easiest most direct path to that  is option 3.
Intermidiate tip: Stay out of it unless you actually wanna invest 24 hours+ of research time looking at sources from both sides before slowly grasping that the situation is fucked, and to complicated to have an unbiased opinion on and that these events have little to no effect on your life and that  life is simply too short and be glad you voted for people who rely on people who have dedicated their lives to grasp geopolitical conflicts.
Holy cow thank you. This answers soooo many questions I had. Of course, you‚Äôre just a random person on Reddit, so I‚Äôll still have to fact check, but no one is actually going deep into the roots for the explanations. How did you know so much? Are you just interested in the topic? Formally/professionally educated on it? Or personally connected to the issue? Just curious lol
It might take more than one
We have no default obligation to do it. We only have to show ID when detained. Which means a crime is reasonably suspected or observed. OR arrested obviously. Its a massive violation of the 4th Amendment. Which... unfortunately police officers are often ignorant of rights... or exploit citizen's ignorance."The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized."
My favorite was the guy who kicked the car as it was driving away, what kind of damage could he possibly think he could do
Son Lux - Easy
Somebody doesn't know what the word trivial means...
Yea, like not even joking, Gen Z uses different social media than Millennials and older.  TikTok, SnapChat, and Instagram are all vertical.
I guess it depends on the platform you're intending to share it on.  TikTok, SnapChat, and Instagram are all vertical like this. I think even Facebook is.If you're going to put it on YouTube or Reddit or something, horizontal makes sense, but if you're going to put it on the other three, vertical makes sense. There's a lot of unnecessary zooming and shaking and moving, so I'm guessing this is a TikTok user.
I mean they were clearly overwhelmed, there‚Äôs dozens of people and only a handful of them. They‚Äôre not fucking superhuman lol.
That isn't what trivial means at all. Trivial in this context means negligible. Meaning the coroners know exactly how much was in his system and that is was so little it would not have any impact on his death
Have you read what Biden has said on this or are we just assuming these people are the standard Dems?
More bullshit, this has nothing to do with religion. The murderous evil Israeli regime has been targeting innocent Palestinian Christians and Muslims alike. While bombing both Churches and Mosques. Also, so many non evil Zionist Jews are on the right side of history. So spare me the lies, all you Zionists sympathizers lie so much, it‚Äôs hilarious.
I can't help but think this is fake.
Eric Garner was his name.
Do these people live in Skokie? Just to make sure you understand my comment, Skokie is a heavily Jewish neighborhood outside of Chicago.
And so have the Palestinians they don't care about land. They hate jews just cause their religion, that's it they don't care about anything else
Either he is dumb as fuck, has balls of steel, or both.
Easiest feared-for-my-life self defense case in the world if this car ends up running someone over. don't know why you'd go toe-to-toe with a 2-ton death machine and think you're going to win.
1) Because once they have your ID, they won't hand it back to you until you've answered all of their questions and/or finished lording their power over you by wasting your time. It's a way to keep you from walking away without officially detaining or arresting you.2) They'll enter your information in their system along with some trumped up reason why they stopped you plus any other shitty details they decide to include about you if you didn't kiss their ass during the encounter.  The next time a cop runs your information, they see that you have a "history" with the police and will treat you differently / assume that you're up to no good.
I mean, coroners dismissed the amount of meth in Floyd‚Äôs system as ‚Äútrivial,‚Äù and said that for a man his size and age, that quantity of fentanyl would not have lead to any serious complications, especially death.What he chooses to do in his own time, is none of my business. We‚Äôre discussing the brutal force used by the police in killing George Floyd. We‚Äôre not talking about the things people choose to do in their free time.
Sean Hannity said so, that's proof enough.
I read a story recently about the guy that filmed the guy being murdered by police for allegedly selling loose cigarettes, Eric something I think.The guy that filmed it was relentlessly harassed by police and eventually jailed for a minor drug offence. During his imprisonment he suffered all kinds of abuse including rat poison in his food.The lesson is that if you dare criticise officers or bring attention to police misconduct, they will stop at nothing to make your life hell.
In America, we have a Constitution which is the Supreme Law of the country. It has a section called the Bill of Rights which feature Amendments that specify certain rights citizens have. The Fourth Amendment grants the right to privacy and prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures. Our Supreme Court rules on certain cases that can modify these rights. In 1968, they ruled on a cased called "Terry v. Ohio" that it is legal for police to temporarily detain someone based on "specific and articulable facts" that a crime has been or will be committed. That is why these are referred to as "Terry stops." If no crime has been or will be committed, the person is not required to identify themselves or even speak to the officer.In the case of this video, there was nothing illegal about a person simply looking into a law enforcement vehicle or speaking to an officer. Thus, the person was within their rights to refuse to ID. If the officer arrested the person on some charge like "obstruction of an officer," the charge would likely be dropped on the grounds that no law was actually being broken.Additionally, many states have created "Stop and Identify" statutes that piggyback off this ruling and require citizens to ID themselves if asked by a law enforcement officer. But if you are not in one of these states, you don't have to. And in most of these statutes the officer also should suspect the person is involved in criminal activity. Officers aren't supposed to be able to just walk around demanding papers and identification. Some of these "Stop and Identify" statutes have also been overturned by the Supreme Court due to violating Fourth Amendment rights, such as one in California (Kolender v. Lawson, 1983).The reason this is important is because it allows citizens to exist without harassment from police. If a police officer is able to identify you, they can use this information to look up your address or home information or somehow link you to nefarious activity even if you are not involved. You have a constitutional *right* to privacy, and this person was well within their rights to exercise it.
Mob mentality of fucking morons.
Oh cut the bullshit. Enough with your lies. The murderous Israeli Zionist hare and have been committing genocide to the Palestinian people for the last 75 years, then Israelis bitch and complain because Hamas has been resisting and defending their own people from the savage acts of the barbaric Israeli regime. You are the ones who cry and bitch because your outraged the world can now see the criminal evil Israeli army and regime for what they are. Spineless cowards who can‚Äôt even after 75 years defeat the resilience of the Palestinian people so they go and attack the innocent civilians and the weak who don‚Äôt even have an army or military. It‚Äôs a disgrace to call the Israeli military a military, they‚Äôre a bunch of cowards who are all being exposed now.
Driver did a great job to disperse the protest. They were just looking for a sink for their aggression and have found their target.
Worst cops in America is in Virginia.
They don't wonder, they see it a badge of pride. They'd much rather be feared than loved.
I don't think you guys understand lol... the cops were trying to protect him from the radicals. If they had their way they would be dragging him through the street.
I mean Rittenhouse proved you don't.
Good point. Do you have an ID on you?
I used to live in Alexandria. Each year, they host (at taxpayer expense) ‚Äúpolice week‚Äù to honor fallen cops. It is a week of them escorting busses from the airport, to luxury hotels with 20-40 motorcycles with sirens and lights blaring. Happens from 6am-whenever they go to bed. It‚Äôs a lot of illegal parking, loud partying, and entitlement. It was awful.
Also the location of a legal battle 45 years ago when a bunch of Nazi's wanted to have a march through the town.It became notable because the ACLU made a point to side with the Nazi's on free speech principles.

For those curious, she's asking them not to record her. They say they aren't recording her. A mutually rude dialogue goes on and the end you already know.
I think I am being nice. Yes I credit him for trying to do that with his post. Do you want me to mail him a cookie or something?
Did they really own the land though? Seems like they are just stealing houses of innocent palestinians in order to get the land ??https://youtu.be/5D5-0bKtwuY?si=9jiSl2G2Q7Sf5sJ9https://youtu.be/_Tlnk0RL5VM?si=BXn-kWwfYHYeDFhT
They got attacked first. You can cry all you want they have every right to defend them selfs. That's what they are doing, and they didn't bomb the hospital. hamas did so keep believing the lies you here on the news.
I saw a guy pulling a gun when he got swarmed. Shit title.
That's super fucked up
Fucking hell man relax I didn't see it. How fucking rude do *you* have to be?
The title is a bit disingenuous. It insinuates that he just went up to a protest and pulled out a gun, when he only pulled it out when he was being swarmed. I'm not saying he's in the right for disrupting their protest, but that gun came out in self defense after being swarmed. Stupid though to go up against an entire protest alone.
It sounds like you guys hold your cops accountable. Here if they get criticized because one of them knelt on a guy for ten minutes until he died, they just go on a soft strike and refuse to do their jobs for a few years.
There is no greater oversight of officers than their own internal command. Higher ranking officers will generally turn a blind eye ir directly participate themselves.Plus cops have the best worker protections in America, so they are hard to punish and even harder to fire.
They may be used to it?
Lets be real.  He pulled the gun after 12 people surrounded him and started bearing him like this was Gaza.  He was stupid, they were stupid, he saved himself a hospital/morgue visit.
Can you post the link? It is blocked on here.
He seemed to be doing just fine until his interaction with LEOs.
That Is QUITE literally their goal with this post. To further educate themselves. Be nice, sheesh
Title said it, but I wasn't prepared...
To my understanding, a good number of orthodox Jews don't support zionism for religious reasons. From a scripture perspective, God would gift Israel to the Jews, not that they would take it through blood. They see the occupation of Palestine as man's hubris and the Israeli state project as not in line with God's plan.
‚ÄúDemocracy‚Äù
Orthodox Jews are a strange bunch. They are against the state of Israel for very specific religious reasons. Basically they believe that according to their scripture Israel wont come to be until after the messiah appears and so the existence of Israel today is basically jumping the gun and against gods plan. Since they already dont agree with Israel on religious grounds i think many of them also adopt pro Palestinian stances. I think it tends to boil down to "we aren't even supposed to have a state here yet so why are we brutalizing the natives?
Per the video evidence, gun guy is not involved in the original confrontation. The guy grabbing the flag has a different hoodie, and different shoes, not to mention gun guy is significantly less fit than the original flag grabber.
They can (and often do) retaliate against you, target you for harassment, know where you live (which is very scary here), label you as "difficult, belligerent, a problem, complaint filer, etc" in the notes next to your name so that it pops up anytime police have contact with you making it more likely they ticket you more often, and/or are more likely to use force against you.These are just a few possible reasons, but mainly, you are not required to do so unless you have committed a crime, even tho they always try to get it anyway, and sometimes arrest you for obstruction and assault you for not doing so,which is illegal.
well that's fucking stupid, how wouldn't they get in more trouble this way? I complained against an officer in Germany once, and your right he did find me later on the streets but only to beg me to lift the complaint not harass.
I read the officer had a power trip but didn't get why asking for ID as a power trip and people agreeing with him. Unless there was another comment i missed
Because cops routinely harass, stalk, and intimidate people that file reports or complaints against them. Giving them your ID makes that process easier for them.
Oh they know, they just don't give a fuck anymore.
Lolllll you‚Äôre right. He just so happened to die from drugs the exact same time a cop was choking the life out of him
ACAB
What a dick of a police officer too. You can tell from start to finish that they‚Äôre not on the same side
I'm *not American* so I don't know all the sensitivities when asking the following: Why is it a big deal to show ID to cops?edit: Yo you can answer me instead of downvoting. Every country i been to it's intuitive to provide ID when asked for it nobody bats an eye
I used to two to this beat in high school, I‚Äôm disgusted with myself now
Take a moment to think before you speak and that guy wouldn't be so right about your pathetic life bro. Any idiot can see being attacked was at least partially responsible for his death. But we don't expect a lot from racists
Are they anti-Zionist or against the government‚Äôs policies towards Palestine? There‚Äôs a huge difference
I always love this take because it attempts to conceal the fact he was tackled and knelt on for 10+ minutes with neck bruises on his body. So to say that attack of police on him didn't add to his death is a straight ignorant statement made by only the dumbest on individuals
Hmm, guess I'll go put on parachute and take on some polar bears in hand to hand combat.
I love accurate titles
Son Lux - Easy
They were dealing with ‚Äúflag ripper‚Äù. The camera pans down to *nobody* around that guy‚Äôs car. He then gets out and chases the woman.
circle gets the square. that's exactly it.
Wow she wheely got it smack in the face!
Lol that was completely unnecessary. Fat zero physical threat Karen starts mouthing off you don't escalate straight to bike in the face.
Source it
Bullshit. He got out of his car and chased a woman around, then decided to go take on a group of people. His car was not being attacked.
Not what I was expecting with the title but damn lmfao
Watch the fucking video, dude. Don‚Äôt be an idiot who has to inject ‚Äúthought police‚Äù into everything.Here‚Äôs the deal:He could‚Äôve simply driven by and paid no mind to the protesters. But he didn‚Äôt. Do you understand that?
9.5 minutes.
liar
acab
Lol even then, unless there was a reason to be that close to another plane in the first place it's really on the pilot for being within 1,000 ft of another plan.
As a Minneapolis resident, this just isn't true. Sure there are neighborhoods that are shit holes, but that's every major city. George Floyd riots did fuck up a lot of the city, but those were generally spots that were already shit holes besides parts of Uptown (which to be honest has been a shit hole, even after gentrification). A lot of people who comment on the state of the city don't even live here.
I get your point, but it's idealistic.When it comes down to the cold hard reality. A father needs to protect his familly, a mother needs to feed and shelter her own. A child needs to grow up. All those things are scarcely made on ideals.When the world is is out to get you killed, praying and believing, might soothe the pain or help with the passing, but it's not making tomorrow any better, even less tonight.
Retribution. And the threat of more retribution to come.That's the reason.
God forbid someone be against more violence
More fake Hamas news

That bike was made in Ukraine.
In an alternative universe, the cameras stick implied him, and they called it a POV
What difftence do you think is between jumping from aircraft at 10000 feet and 200 knots than 35000 feet and going 500 knots
yep we do, even though its illegal to stop traffic if you aren‚Äôt of authority.god forbid you try to move those protesting, you‚Äôll get arrested.they haven‚Äôt moved for people rushing to hospital (ambulances or not), if i remember correctly theres been a couple of instances where a family was rushing to hospital as their grandmother was passing away in hospital. they didn‚Äôt make it in time to see her due to the protests.
Not talking about the video dumb dumb.
Took so long I went and got popcorn.  Missed it.
Mucked around and mound out
Lmao, this idiot jumps himself if anything.
this video gets shorter every time it's posted.
Time to bail
That wasn't necessary..
Cops should unloaded on that shitstain
Which are both much less deadly than a gun you fucking weapon
Yea, the guy kneeling directly on his chest for 5 minutes couldn't have possibly been the cause!

They didn't say supporting Palestine was anti-Semitic. They said anti-Semitism is on the rise.It is. So is Islamophobia.
I can‚Äôt imagine what kind of lowlife trash someone would have to be to lie about that story, and then attempt to spread it to like what, 10 people? You have zero influence, wasting your life.
I don't mind if it's around government buildings. When it's just in some random place meant to obstruct random people then it's a problem.
Just wtf
Not me. Once they try to get in my car that's when the hammer hits the bullet and they're going to find out what happens when they fuck around.
Isn't a two party system great.
For those who don't know, Skokie has a very large Jewish community. In the past neo-Nazis purposely chose to march through Skokie just to piss off the Jews there.
If you think running back towards a crowd is running away you're fucking brain dead. You're welcome to watch the video around the 0:24 second mark a few more times and see if you can't come to a better conclusion. Maybe you hadn't had your coffee.
Crazy that this can even happen, but it happens
"man drives car on road."
brother, he literally is chasing them with gun in hand.
I‚Äôm guessing it‚Äôs because the situation deteriorated quickly. If you look closely there were already a few officers in the crowd trying to control things best they could, but there was only so much they could do. There was at least one officer that was right there when the gun was pulled. Backup was probably already headed towards the altercation.
That's because these are the same assholes that want Israel wiped off the face of the Earth.  An old white guy in America getting in their way isn't important to them.  He's just another obstacle to them seeing their goal achieved.
C is for changing the f-word mid-rhyme!
Why do protesters block roads? What's the point?
Guns are the problem. Or is our country just just more crazy than any other?
It‚Äôs worked for some people.
Poor car. Won‚Äôt someone think of the aesthetic damage!
He had zero reason to ask for ID. Just a power trip.
Parachutes require skill to be used and most accidents happen in altitudes where a parachute would be useless anyway. I don't think there is a rule banning Parachutes since why would they even ban them?
These sorts of people that have the habit of creating LARGE GROUPS to protest in this manner are running on borrowed luck, someone, somewhere, at some point will pull out a rifle and start shooting indiscriminately. Luckily we haven't gotten to that stage yet and we hope it never happens
And then you have conspiracy theorists like Alex Jones who are both. Must be a real confusing time for them.
God the attitude on that fucking pig.
Yes. Attack his car. Really backs up the cause there. Idiots.
&gt;Palestinians are semites too, if you didn't knowAnd avocados are technically berries. What's your point?
‚Äú We don‚Äôt know why the public doesn‚Äôt respect us anymore ‚Äú
Minneapolis has been a shithole for over 30 years. Remember the Murderapolis years?
stop shooting rockets into Israel and the bombing will probably stop ffs!
You can't be defending yourself when you yourself instigated the initial conflict.
Benjamin netanyahu literally pulling a Kyle Rittenhouse.
Fucking terrorists.
At the rate these situations occur, I‚Äôm shocked why there hasn‚Äôt been like a distressed driver just saying ‚Äòscrew it‚Äô and genuinely plow everyone that gets in front of them just to get away. Because I know certainly the second a windshield is broken from my vehicle anyone trying to stand in front and attack my car is not getting sympathy from me as I push the pedal.
‚ÄúCitizens don‚Äôt need high capacity mags for self defense!‚Äù- Gets mobbed by 30+ people.
As soon as they rushed the vehicle the driver should have just floored it. No doubt they would have killed him otherwise. Promote their asses to speed bumps in the name of self defense!
Are you talking about the guy that ran away in the beginning? They are 2 different people, the guy in the car is heavier, big mustache and green hat, I don't see him anywhere in the beginning of the video.
I think you should read "art of war" by Sun Tzu. You are looking at this whole situation in a very simple way.Also the Hamas "terrorists" did target Israeli outposts first. They killed hundreds of IDF and then moved into the settlements and the concert. I'm not defending that, but welcome to war.
So the cops were in the crowd and watching 50 people attack a single man, and when the man pulls a 'Peacemaker' to defend himself all of a sudden the cops draw theirs and arrest him.  What bizarro world do we live in?
You mean that mob of antisemites attacked a pro Israel jew and got a gun pulled on them when they surrounded and started to beat him?
ü§òüèº
Pugs
But its incredibly unlikely you would ever egress in time. Opening a commercial liner door in flight isnt very easy at all.
Yeah, the situations where the plane is going to be controllable enough to come down to a reasonable altitude, attitude, and speed for hundreds of people to parachute off - are almost 100% survivable already.  And the survival rate for untrained people parachuting with emergency parachutes is also going to be below 100%.
Loving this üòÑ
why did the planes get that close? Don‚Äôt they use coordinates?
George couldn't breath because of a pigs kneeThe pig couldn't breath because of his need to keep eating donuts
Did they pick Stokie because of its Jewish population? In 1977 the National Socialist Party of America formerly, the American Nazi party,held a march there because of that reason
Anyone else enjoy that little yell ?
My guess is he tried to get out to confront the first guy who kicked his car.  Probably wasn't the smartest move.
I recall the UK has a problem with those Just Stop Oil protestors doing the same.
You realize that he was part of the confrontation in the beginning over the flag? He wasnt just sitting there minding his own business. He could have just driven away at that point, but chose to go out and.continue the fight. 100% self inflicted.
This is very common
Geeze, what a pig. A) cops job is nowhere near as dangerous as they claimB) cops consume way too much of cities budgets, money that could be better spend improving communitiesC) there is no such thing as a good cop. You may meet one that does something cool, in a particular moment but they are not good.D) avoid supporting businesses or people that support the police
So provocative to live a place and think that bombing hospitals is bad. How dare they do that in a town that has a museum

 Why didn‚Äôt he stay home is the exact same reasoning as look what‚Äôs she was wearing. Just because this guy left his house doesn‚Äôt mean something bad should happen to him. He had every right to be there just like they did. I‚Äôm not excusing the other stuff, but the stay home comment is asinine.
Completely dystopian vibes. a terrified elderly man outrunning terrorist sympathizers out of fear for his life while the defunded police are no where to be found for miles. I hate the 2020s.
People forget about his 2 million dollar bail, which only a little under half was released to pay his lawyers.
Yes, because most of gaza hates LGBT
On that note... These protests arent going to do ANYTHING. A protest in Israel might, but unlikely. In the US? Not a chance.
And then they wonder why no one likes cops anymore.
no doubt i woulda gassed it
I agree with that 100%. Hand guns + gang violence are for sure inflating the mass shooting numbers, but a realistic quarrel is the immediate damage done just based on the size and power of the round from an assault style long gun vs most hand guns. 5.56-7.62 will do a hell of alot more damage to the body than a 9mm.
At the beginning it looks like the driver got out of his car and was going to talk to the people and ask for passage maybe(or argue... who knows)... but he left the car in gear and had to jump back in.  At that point he was getting swarmed.  I wouldn't get back out either.I also wouldn't have crept my car into the crowd in the first place though unless I knew I had an emergency to get to or an appointment that I waited months for.  I wanna hope he was asking if they could nicely just let him pass but fucked up and left the car in gear... but who knows nowadays? He could have been getting out to have words. He obviously wan't trying to intentionally hurt anyone even after they went for his car and we have seen what can happen in that situation.  I wonder if leaving his car in gear is the brain fart that changes his life.  One little mistake.
Don't hit someone's car then?
10 years. It's from 2013.
Definitely seems like dude wanted to be the next Rittenhouse but got cold feet.
‚ÄúMan tries to escape unlawful detention‚Äù
I was in a barbershop quartet there for a while.
Huh? A lady runs at his parked car, either throws something at it or hits it. He pursues the vandal, she's a lil quicker than him so he turns around then sees his car surrounded by jobless morons. ACAB that's why
What about the fish on the sea where the plane crashed?
Yeah but the numbers that get thrown around for the "mass shooting epidemic" have figures inflated by gang related shootings. Those gangs are using handguns by a significant degree. Its disingenuous to call an AR common mass shooting rifle when its probably not even in 20% of mass shootings.
They're lucky he didn't start blasting.
Unintentionally correct double negative.
Which 'Murica has decided is completely legal and will make you a minor celebrity so you can cash in on a few hundred G's worth of talk show appearances
Yeah you've got to be shitting me with these people. Who the fuck praises the people that block major roads so they can show their support to the people that straight up say they want to eradicate Americans and jews. It's so fucked up
I imagine statistically speaking this is very correct, but speaking from school shootings to gay night club gunmen the assault style long gun has burned an image into our heads of what a mass casualty weapon would look like.
Nah, even without a gun, a bored idiot like that would still be attention seeking and wanting to stir shit and would probably have some sort of weapon on him anyway.
"Gets jumped" lol. He pretty much instigated all of that.
How many of these people are living paycheck to paycheck and just trying to get to work. These fucking clowns who block roads are taking food off people's tables and away from children.
Actually the most common mass shooter weapon is a handguns because they are so easily concealed.
Because he was actively fighting people, until the gun came out most likely scenario is some prick trying to beat up a woman gets his temple rung and an ER visit.
Surprisingly not by the cops this time.
Come on that's so old it's like the 100th repost of that

Ya mine is smokin stuck on dumb in awww thinking I would never!
That protest is filled with plenty of fighting aged people. Why not send them to gaza so they can actually help.
Give him life in prison, even.
I‚Äôm willing to bet that at least 75% of the protestors have no idea about the history of Israeli and Palestinian conflict. They just want an excuse to go out and act like assholes.
Thank you for this!
NRA force is strong with this one
Trust funds. It's mostly the wastoid children of coastal elites.
Same
Religion of pissFtfy
so they should organize it as skydiving commercial airliners and give people parachutes before flights
Kyle didn‚Äôt do any of that‚Ä¶.
You know what?! Fair. Gimme a handshake and let‚Äôs talk over ice cream at Dairy Queen.
Nah man that lady he was chasing feared for her life she should have pulled out her self-defense firearm instead of being smart and removing herself from the situation and running away Into the thick of it like the cool kids say
Fucking unless pilotEdit useless*   Auto correct did me wrong lol
Why did he leave his carWhy did he chase that lady away  Why didn‚Äôt he stay homeHotel?Trivago!
I wear a parachute esp on the subway. It‚Äôs a herringbone plaid, very slimming.
I think that points to lack of critical thinking Think of all the gun owners that don‚Äôt do dumb shit like this Remove the gun, guy would have showed up with a knife or baseball bat
How the cops gonna be completely useless until he gets jumped and defends himself then they throw him to the ground like wow only if this was avoidable
Down here in the shallow blue sea!
You can't instigate a fight then claim self defense
After you antagonize someone and chase down a lady running away from youYes it is lol
Not a crazyfuckingvideo.
The faa also requires them to wear parachute
Yes it obviously does at it creates a negative association.These protesters are brainless bandwagoners.
Why did the police only come when he pulls out the gun.
Yikes. Running away is ‚Äúbaiting‚Äù apparently. Edit: Too many dumb people not realizing I‚Äôm talking about Kyle Rittenhouse, not the video.
What would you do if some idiot got out of his car in a rage?
He got jumped by a group of people. I see nothing wrong. Sucks that the cop didn‚Äôt try to help until after he pulled it out.
We ALL are skydiving now ü§†
I remember that plenty other states too!
N is for never to be seen again
It's a statement on their place in society.
We have that law in FL
Except those on the ground receiving the debris üôÉ
it‚Äôs ok. it gave ME a chuckle :). The word you‚Äôre looking for is protestor. I understand tho why Protestant sounded correct. Defendant. Litigant. Protestant. :)
To expose the cynical, barbaric, evil Israeli regime. The truth is finally coming out. Israel pays billions of dollars to hide and polish their massacres of the Palestinians. Now the world can see first hand what they really are.
What‚Äôs more proof than this video? The only clowns are the ones in this video and all of the illegal Israelis and it‚Äôs sinister regime. You all are mad because the murderous Israeli Zionists are finally being exposed for what they are, bunch of spineless cowards. This are your disgusting evil people. Anyone who argues otherwise is acknowledging and is complicit to the ethnic cleansing and genocide of the the Palestinian people.
I say it's worth it. As long as you get at least 100 likes. Then you look cool/badass and get all of the women with the big gazungas
I‚Äôve seen dogs do it but they too get hit by cars.  I would‚Äôve hoped as humans we were smarter..
Looks like self defence to me.
Or could be put on a kebab and burnt with a piece of steak?
the protesters are supposed to get permits and obv not do it in the road. There IS a process for it, they just don‚Äôt feel they need to follow it. Why would anyone want to protect people who honestly aren‚Äôt there to peacefully protest but to cause issues?The only response to this is sending SWAT out and we all know how that will turn out.. more fodder for the media and anti-police rhetoric. So now they just let the fire burn itself out. They did used to respond like you suggested but we see where that got them so now it‚Äôs like this. Can‚Äôt have it both ways.
Welfare?
Pretty sure the courts ruled blocking the streets like this is illegal during all the George Floyd and likewise protests.  I'd slow down a little but I'm not changing my course because they want to be assholes.
Those aren't protesters any more they are attackers.
 No, guns are the problem. Without a gun this fool never steps out of his car trying to confront people. He did that shit on purpose to shoot someone and become a foxnews hero like rittenhouse. Glad the cops were somewhat aware of it and handled it quick
I cannot tell you how many former cops there are in sales now. So many were on the fence anyways but the Wilson case and the Floyd case had them out the door.Some people are of the mindset cops are dumb but some of them have engineering, physics and PhDs. So just like you said, the good/quality cops see the writing on the wall and they know they can get a better job, they just honestly loved serving their community. Until their community turns into a flaming dumpster fire.
If you‚Äôre going to quote Wikipedia verbatim, then put the words in quotes
This shit and the people I knew became so exhausting that if that‚Äôs what ‚Äúleft‚Äù is now I don‚Äôt identity or relate to it anymore. These people have lost their minds with self righteous indignation and I want off the train. A similar type of extremism and teams that pushed certain parties farther right is happening to the left now.
my strategy of grabbing a pint and waiting for all this to blow over isn't working anymore.
There is no one more sick and deranged than the murderous illegal Israeli military and it‚Äôs cynical regime. So now Israel wants to bitch when they are finally being exposed for what they really are. The world can finally see first hand and the Israeli colonizers are so mad and terrified, a bunch of cowards too afraid to face Hamas head in so they deliberately target and kill innocent civilians, bomb hospitals and churches and ambulances then try to cover it up by even killing journalists. There is no argument to what is happening and the world can now see. Israeli is and has been committing genocide towards the Palestinian people.

Looks like the other plane was increasing altitude and had a blind spot. And the pilot with people hanging on the wing had a blind spot for the other plane before it was too late to register.
Union jobs with great benefits packages, surely.
Seriously... And whos the droolmasters who upvoted that?
Because they dont want to face the reality of their weight/size, why would they want to face the reality of the world?
How come he got arrested. They were going to kill him
It‚Äôs was looking like a call of duty campaign mission . Very scary .
How them ankles doing ?
Antisemitism and Islamophobia on the rise, add guns to that mix. It's a perfect recipe for a shit show
Guns are not the problem. Lack of critical thinking skills and control over emotions would be the problem here. Looks like there were already police officers in the parking lot. Apparently there were some off screen. There was no reason to leave the physical buffer that a car offers. The decision making process went down hill from there.
Incorrect. Just because you don't like the arguments doesn't make it trolling. Israel, in particular the current PM has done a lot to maintain and elevate the current conflict to push the narrative you believe.
Israel has every right I defend itself. It got caught with its pants down. They need to neutralize Hamas as best as they can
Everything about that video was way too close
I think someone reposting for karma kicks off a bunch of bots doing the same in the ensuing weeks. Been noticing the trend on more than just this video

I‚Äôm going to laugh at this comment all day. Lol
Wtf was he supposed to do? Get ripped out of his car and get beat up or murdered because everyone's acting like psychos? Fuck all that! Those fuckers are lucky they didn't get ran over. With all that chaos some people would have tried to get to safety more aggressively. Those shit heads are stupid lucky idiots. Fuckin disgusting people right there, damn
A&amp;E did a documentary on that a few years ago, found one of the guys who hit that man in the head with a brick and interviewed him. The scumbag said he had no remorse and was actually happy he did that. Just a terrible human.
"... and tolerance!"Said as they give eachother winks and nudges.
Except pass a law making it legal to plow through protests and make it illegal to block major roadways.
Me: jumps in the lion den on my own accord to fuck with the lions.Me: *gets mauled by lions*Me: im gonna shoot those lions! They attacked me! and because they attacked me it gives me the right to shoot them!Me: i am not at fault because i am less of an animal than those lions. And i was only defending myself, as i am a victim of my own stupidity. Best bet i was poking the proverbial bear!
Send all those mofo's to gaza.. screw them. Poor guy was scared!
Some people confuse the definition of a protest and a riot .
Claims not a KR fan ‚Äúwhen the pedophile attacked him‚Äù okay bud we all know what news you watch. Kyle should have stayed home, or not brought an assault weapon to a riot, it made him a target, if he never had that thing strapped around him none of that would‚Äôve happened. Sure he may have been justified in defending himself by the law, but he and his guardians should be seeing jail time and lawsuits for making the situation possible in the first place.if he had a concealed carry this probably wouldn‚Äôt have happened. Because he wouldn‚Äôt be flashing around a common mass shooter weapon.Edit: carrying around a mass shooter weapon at a possible mass casualty event.
Must be... Arrested Development.I'll be at the banana stand
They know the mob will be allowed to rampage, but there will be video evidence of them running em over.
No your not. You were just trolling for an argument.
They are probably someof the smartest people on the planet. Even if they did tolerate visitors trying to share religion in no time would come the bliated, gut-wrenching superwealthy money whores to rob them of any tiny thing they possess which we think might make us a nickel. We destroy everything we touch so good for them for keeping us away.
Fucking idiots
They were fucked.
I always wonder how these types of people have PTO????
The guy was nowhere near the flag at the start. He stops his car in the middle of the road and starts chasing people.
Crazy world
Pretty sure that's not a protest but just an excuse for some people to create a ruckus and who would've guessed, it backfires.
that's daft to think lol
Yea, dont go to protests punching random people. Theres a lot of people out for blood and you might run into one of them. Ones who downvoted deserve a darwin award.
Like the Minneapolis PD still gives a shit after Floyd lmao
When the plane decides to skydive too‚Ä¶
These are criminals, this was never a protest.
Get out of the fucking road if you don't wanna get run over.
I mean you're not wrong, I wondered why the name was so familiar https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Socialist_Party_of_America_v._Village_of_Skokie
How do people still think it‚Äôs okay to block public roads for a cause.
Still, it would be uselessYou would need training to use parachute, additional oxygen if jumping from 35k feet altitude, the conditions are bad, and you cant even open the door becouse of diffrences in air pressure and speed, and if you could open the door you would just slam to the body of the aircraft when jumping out.
Sry, not a native speaker. People who protest
UNRWA School been bombarded on 23.10.23...kids in the school are victims. Israel bombed them.. not Hamas but israel. If Hamas was using this civilian as human shield, why bombing themselves?. Unless it's the other side that bombed themIf israel intercepted the Hamas conversation? Why do nothing at the time. Because there was never a conversation, only lies, propaganda that want to justify their action.AI evidence are so funny. The most advanced military have the effort of kindergarten arts.Ghargard cant save you.
ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èThese people really think they're victims. This crowd was beating the mans car and would have beaten him. He had ever right to get himself to safety. This is why you don't protest in the street. This is why protesting in the street is illegal.
It'd just be your carry-on
I always wonder how these types of people have the time for all these protests
I used to care and listen to protestors. Now I just see them as criminals. What a shame.
The amount of people that dont lock their car doors, I don't get it. The first thing I do is seatbelt and lock the door once I am in the car.
Protesters are 100% in the wrong here
if only it was possible to tilt the recording device somehow and get a landscape frame...
As much as this sounds a great idea, it will not work.Bringing parachutes to commericial airline would give a lot of unneccesary weight and you wouldn't even be able to jump out of it becouse of speed and air pressure.
he didnt cater to the whims of entitled protestors breaking the law and for that he must pay of course
The cop was moving over there to break up the scuffle. And the dude with the gun forced himself into a situation to pull his gun. If he had shot somebody, that would not be classified self-defense.
Protestants? lol
i‚Äôll never understand the psychology of people who when surrounded by protestors baying for blood, just sit there while their car is getting kicked and smashed up. Many just just panic and sit there and let it happen. No fucking way.
Deport them all to Gaza.
Palestinians look peaceful /s
I feel like the first pull should be the parachute...
Stupid joke is stupid
Interesting that pro-Palestinians can't even control themselves in protests in democratic open countries. What a shame.
It looks like he drove through an opening in the protestors and then they swarmed and attacked him. I don't get how he could be even slightly at fault here.
Threw the rock first to break the surface tension. Smart move I reckon.
Can anyone tell me the name of the song that has that melody? Haven't heard that in AWHILE
I feel that it's important information to include that Skokie, Illinois has a very large Jewish community. At one point it was almost 60% Jewish. It's also home to the Illinois holocaust museum.
Probably Gen Z.
Skokie, Illinois is 30% Jewish and home to the national holocaust museum. They knew what they were doing. Skokie has twice received national attention for court cases decided by the United States Supreme Court. In the mid-1970s, it was at the center of National Socialist Party of America v. Village of Skokie, in which a Nazi group, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union, invoked the First Amendment in an attempt to schedule a Nazi rally in Skokie. At the time, Skokie had a significant population of Holocaust survivors. Skokie ultimately lost that case, though the rally was never held.
It's hard to know reality but survey have \~50% Hamas support (not specifically to now)  \&gt;According to a recent survey conducted by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, 57% of Gazans have a positive opinion of Hamas.  https://www.nbcnews.com/news/world/hamas-wins-palestinian-hearts-gaza-conflict-threatens-broader-shift-n1272330  \&gt;Another poll conducted by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy found that 52% of Palestinians in the West Bank and 64% of Palestinians in East Jerusalem have a positive opinion of Hamas.  [https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/polls-show-majority-gazans-were-against-breaking-ceasefire-hamas-and-hezbollah](https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/polls-show-majority-gazans-were-against-breaking-ceasefire-hamas-and-hezbollah)  Hamas officially wants Israel not to exist.  If you see what Palistinias (and their Arab friends) chant in all protests: "from the river to the sea", meaning all of the territory, no Israel.  In Gaza schools and possibly some in the west bank they teach that all the Israel territory is theirs and Israel stole not just the territory but all the wealth. (Much of the area developed by Israel was marches/swamp that Israelis have drained by selected tree planting and worked to what it is today... you can also look at the wealth of the Neibouring Arab countries vs Israel and note that only recently some natural resources were found and they aren't a main economic factor)  Not going to research at the moment but I think only the people in Lebanon dislike Hezbollah, but they sure align with the other Palestinian&amp;Arab narrative.  IDK how much Palestinian citizen take note of Iran as promoting all the hostilities, Israel considers Iran enemy number 1. And they don't usually count  Palestinians as enemies at times of calm.  There were several attempt by left leaning Israel government to negotiate agreements with Palestinian government, a couple signed with the west bank called "Oslo Accords". With the Gaza strip there wasn't much co-operation, Israel tried a one sided move to withdraw from the strip, give them weapons to form a police force and a bunch more stuff, if you ask Israelis now this might have been a historical horrible mistake that created what is going on for decades now in Gaza strip with rockets and morter raining on Israel for decades now.  Consider that all this time even under fire, Israel was supplying the Gaza strip with Electricity, food, water, building materials, funds, facilitating foreign aid etc. basically paying the people that shoot at them.  Egypt used to turn a blind eye from Gaza people crossing and smuggling with tunnels and otherwise until they had enough of the attacks in their own territory   In the last couple of years some Arab countries started to normalise relationships with Israel that they never recognised before, that is one-pointed reason for this round of hostilities
Yes, the Palestinian Jews, not the Jews, were running away from the Germans and say "Germans destroyed our family,do not destroyed our hope". The fact that anyone from any country can take Israeli citizenship if they are Jewish. When the attack happens, the people of Israel run to Europe to their real land.
She probably only went there so she can cause a scene.
Non Palestinian Americans protesting for Palestine. Do these people not realise that Palestinians don't think the same way they do? Hamas is even anti-west.People waving ISIS, Taliban, and Hamas flags.. and people are okay with it, not realising that those flags represent extremist groups that teach the Jihad against Infidels/non-believers.
They want us to pick sides to start a war.
I like how they are acting like he ran someone over, instead of just pushing himself through a blockage and then trying to get further away from it after they started assaulting him and destroying his car. Get out of the road you losers.
How do you get enough to do a jump/dive like this? Like is everyone one of these ppl a professional diver at some point or are they just winging it?

Police? Where the fuck are you?
The world's going to hell now. Death to Hamas and death to terrorism
When are they gonna learn not to block the roads.
Stop terrorizing innocent people. Poor guy.
Yeah and it looks like the whole thing started with them ripping his Israel flag out of his hands.
If I had a crowd of angry people surrounding and hitting my car, you can bet I'd drive straight through them as well to get to safety.
Looks like the skydivers forgot they were in a tiny ass plane and all moved to the right side making the plane unavoidably tip.
So would you say Hamas had every right to strike the rocket on Oct 7th? If so, do Palestinians support it? If not, at least do majority support Hamas and would elect them to be their government should they win victory? Also, do Palestinians have a positive attitude of how Iran funds and taught Hamas? Also, what are Palestinians perspective of Hezbollah? Do Palestinans want Zionists to leave completely or form a 2/3 state country?
I saw an old man barely escaping an angry mob. Didn't look like he hit anyone..

imagine being the dumbass that got baited
Where did they bury the survivors again.
He literally waited until there was a clear path to get through and then sped up while he had the chance. He went out of his way to NOT hit anybody, and yet they are all acting like he is a psychopath breaking news there‚Äôs a psycho on the loose who DROVE THROUGH A PROTEST!!!!
This was never a peaceful protest.
I heard condoms are also safe. It might work, idk.
Alright she runs to the front of his car, then towards the back of it, and if you slow it down you can clearly see her either pulling at something on the car or slapping something down on it. Her hand is grabbing something yellow right before the camera pans off her. She‚Äôs not just ‚Äòtouching his car to steady herself‚Äô, she was running towards the back of it and pushed off of it after grabbing something on the car. Slow down the video and watch, it is not as innocent as you‚Äôre making it soundHe chases her away, rightfully so after she was grabbing some shit on his car and then pushing off of it, which I hope we‚Äôve all taken a minute to go and see for ourselves, because that isn‚Äôt my opinion, that‚Äôs what happened. Once he chases her away he turns and chases away the guy with the flag, and then he gets clobbered in the back of the head by a guy who ran up behind him. Once again, go watch this for yourself. That alone warrants lethal self defense, not to mention the mob beating that Why did he chase her? Because she fucked with his car. He stopped chasing when she was a good distance away from his car. What would he do if he caught her? Well when he caught up to her, he let her keep running, so that‚Äôs that question figured out. Also, I don‚Äôt believe he shot at them, or at least there isn‚Äôt enough in this video to justify the assertion. If there was a shot fired, although the camera is pretty bad I‚Äôm pretty sure it was when he reached his arm up into the air, but without audio I don‚Äôt know if he shot or just brandished which panicked the mob. Either way, shooting into the air, while unsafe, is not the same as shooting into the mob
Title makes it sound like he rammed into them and killed a bunch of people when he slowly drove through and sped off once he no longer had anyone in front of his car.
"FIND THIS MAN!!" How about no you fucking lemonade sandwich
Y'all really won hearts and minds with the peaceful protest there. SMH*
Anyone can peacefully protest, but when you start bashing a car and or REACHING INTO THE CAR TO STRIKE OR PULL THE DRIVER OUT you become the assailant, not the victim and you deserve whatever you get.
&gt; and the protestors get counseling for their aggressionI think they should get much more
*most people learn this early on
easy by son lux
Notice how the protestors are always the losers of society
Classic pro-pali behaviour, nothing new...
Give that man an award!
No no no, if you‚Äôre surrounded by a mob and being beaten in any context, you can use lethal self defense. Getting out of your car near a protest is not sufficient justification for a mob to be allowed to beat someone without them defending themselves lethally. A mob beating is a potentially lethal situation. If an anti-trump person were to exit their vehicle at a MAGA protest and the people were to surround that person and beat them, would you really ethically compel them to have their life endangered by a mob beating and not respond with lethal force? Like what reality are we living in here?? Lethal force is allowed when a mob is beating you, I can‚Äôt believe people disagree. At least up to the point where the mob flees, but if they‚Äôre actively beating you 100% you can use ethically use lethal force. Also, we have no idea why he stopped and got out, so using that as the basis for any argument right now is dubious at bestLastly, he didn‚Äôt put himself in the middle of the mob. They weren‚Äôt surrounding his car. He exited and they rushed him, to be clear very
yeah, great way to ask for people's support
Yeah, that‚Äôs just the rule for a nomination for the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù award and entry into the short-lived Darwin Award books by Wendy Northcutt and is generally for celebrities or otherwise notable figures.The original and common usage bestows the award upon *anyone* who does something astonishingly stupid to take themselves out of the gene pool.They mock these dumdums who just barely manage to survive by ‚Äúnominating‚Äù them for their own Darwin Award.
Thank you!
To get counseling you first need to recognize you need help. Not a single one of those protesters will go to therapy for their violence problem. IF they go it'll be for some reason that makes them feel like victims.
Thank you! I‚Äôll look into it!
Someone needs to stop these people. Oh wait...
Lol!![gif](giphy|uKIGaaCpNDhqU)
Lol!!!
I‚Äôm so sick of these assholes that block roads for their fucking protests. Not doing anything for their cause.. just inconveniencing normal people and then harassing the fuck out of anyone who doesn‚Äôt have time for their shit.
How exactly is this a peaceful protest? I mean they really took this personally, chasing this guy and harassing him but yet they posted this saying "find this guy"?! As if HE did ANYTHING wrong?! Poor man is just trying to live his life and get somewhere. The only one I want to find and punch are the idiots who thought it was beneficial to their cause to harass an old man to the point of terror. He was on the verge of a heart attack in that bit where we saw him. That's someone's grandfather. Guarantee most of these kids can't even show you where Israel or Palestine is on a map. Stop using world politics to filter your childish rage through. Go throw an axe or something instead. Rant over.
sorry, you surround someone and try to drag them out of their car, you can expect to get ran over.this is why it shouldn't be allowed for "protesters" to block roads.
That was horrific
hey look at that, just went from what I assume was an unlawful protest locking down streets to a riot. and now I care even less for their cause. poor old man.
Block a busy street with your protest, someone tries to drive thru ... attack him. Make him fear for his life so that he runs over people. WTG dumbass protesters.
and they open the door and terrorize the driver how fitting
Not sure why that video is age restricted, its just some dusty kid in a bed while you can hear the cameras in the background taking pics as fast as they can.
If that dude was black he would have been shot, luckily for him he wasn‚Äôt lol
People weren‚Äôt meant to post on Reddit
I'm not surprised he pulled a gun , despite him being right or wrong this guy was getting jumped by several people and your life can very much be in danger but same thing happened with Kyle Rittenhouse so idk tbh...like dude said what a shit show.
Why is Hamas doing this?
What a great way to enlist support for your cause.
Say his name.
&gt; Why can‚Äôt law enforcement control these protests?1) Told not to.2) "Gee, that might get me hurt." Not that it's a bad excuse, thousands and thousands of protestors and it's just you and maybe a partner in your car?  Yeah, fuck that.3) "Fuck that noise, I don't want to go to prison for doing the shit I am supposed to do and someone threw me under the bus because they're a partisan hack."4) Because of #3, a lot of decent cops aren't cops any more, a lot of cops quit.  This raises #2 and allows the type of people who sympathize with these assholes to become cops.  Or in other words, when you punish the good cops, you're effectively grooming the force to only be bad cops.  Firing those that didn't want the covid injection was a massive proxy for this effect.I'm sure there are more possibilities, but these are the most frequently noted.
So he was supposed to let an angry mob beat the shit out of him?? That‚Äôs lucrative.
A lady with a poster tries to cross the street in front of his car but sees him open the door and tries to go around instead. As she does, he gets out of the car and starts chasing her (she touches his car to steady herself as she changes direction to run away from him). Other protesters notice and run after him to stop him. He then turns back and attacks the group that approached him. Then he gets overwhelmed with the group and shoots at them. Hardly righteous self defense. Had he kept chasing her, what do you think he would have done to her? Why did he run after her in the first place?
Why didn‚Äôt he jump onto the back of the other plane
Actually this does make me feel different about it. It makes me care less, unfortunately, because I hate these assholes in the video and now I don't want to care about or support their cause. Maybe im just an asshole, but they're getting the opposite of what they apparently want from me.
Fuckin rats
And that poor little girl!  How scared she must have been!
Good for the driver. Fuck these people.
Respect to the old guy. He could have easily ploughed through that group killing dozens. He looked like he was bleeding and terrified. For what? So that naive bubble heads can display virtues like the lates fashion. Nauseous. I Hope the guy is safe.
If their form of protest was to blockade traffic, sympathy exponentially declines.
Yeah but why tf would they film a horizontal video vertically? And then zoom in and out every other second?
Skokie and Gelnview are some of the quieter and good places in Chicago Suburban areas. Even those areas have started to look like South Chicago nowadays lol
Looks like a job for the second amendment!But for real, there are crazies everywhere nowadays, protect yourself.
These folks are doing NOTHING to help their cause.
I have never and will never understand the psychology of people who chase after cars. It‚Äôs hella weird.
What is this song
Well these people protested a pro Israel event. lolEdit: Just to be clear I dont agree with a gun being pulled on anyone but framing it as if people randomly showed up to a free Palestine protest isn‚Äôt accurate.Naturally I‚Äôm getting downvoted to hell for telling the truth. lol
Idiots stand in front of law abiding citizen's cars trying to commit suicide. There i fixed the headline.
Mostly peaceful üïäÔ∏è
I flipped from voting R to some D's in the Trump era. Watching how D's responded to the Trump era made me no longer want to vote for them either. I now vote third party when I can and when it makes sense.
People can protest but why block traffic. When has it been effective in shaping policies and influencing people to the cause?
To say that this shit has gotten totally out of control is a serious understatement
‚ÄúOld man escapes after Terrorist supporters attack his car‚Äù fixed your title
What does her race have to do with the situation
To arrest the innocent driver.
Look more propaganda sick fucks hamas fault not isreal
Good.
I‚Äôm good on finding him. Wish he would have floored it.
Poor old guy. What are they trying to accomplish by mobbing him exactly?
Hell yeah. Love thrash üí™
This is indistinguishable from a scene in a zombie movie.
Why is this trend of putting up txt right over the subject a thing now?
Just let him through ffs. No justification for hitting his car and ganging up around him like that.
Disgusting terrorising innocent commuters like that.
What happened to calling up your local government and getting them to close off an area ahead of time so you don't get situations like this?
Most security cameras don't allow footage to be downloaded/uploaded and are saved on servers off-site (to keep people from editing it), so this is the best way to show camera footage.
I don't understand how anyone who's pro LGBTQ could ever be Pro-Palestine- a country that hunts down gays and executes them
Mostly peaceful. Eff all these violent protesters. That's not going to win anyone over.
Those rioters are gonna get shot, and it will be their own fault.
Thugs.
God these people are idiots. Stop standing in front of cars boys!
You are wrong. Righteous self defense would be if they dragged his ass out of the car and proceeded to beat him for no reason. If that happened, then if he pulled his gun he would be justified. He purposely put himself in the middle of a mob when he could have easily driven away. In fact, the crowd wasn‚Äôt even blocking the road/his car. If he shot someone the self defense claim could certainly be made, but he would lose and rightfully so! The video speaks for itself.
One Jew could walk on it.
Are you talking about the guy in the video? I'm sure when he was chasing that girl around his car for seemingly no reason he was just trying to exercise his right to free speech."Young lady, excuse me! Ma'am! Hey get back here and listen to my thoughts on the Israeli-Palestinian two state solution and why I think the recent acti- STOP RUNNING"
Fuckin losers
There are way too many people in America with guns. I mean seriously, this guy got **out of his car** to chase and get in a confrontation with a CROWD of angry people and despite clearly getting overwhelmed and visibly outnumbered, he continues to get in the middle of this crowd AND pulls a gun! I‚Äôm sure in his mind, and unfortunately in the minds of others, he is justified because ‚Äúhe feared for his life.‚Äù But I honestly think he just wanted an excuse to shoot the people he doesn‚Äôt like.
He looks terrified to me
I mean these people stuck by a band of terrorists that kidnapped, raped and murdered innocent civilians and beheaded babies, I don't think assaulting a random old man is going to change anyone's mind at this point.
I've only ever voted Democrat and never will again.
They were gonna Reginald Denny him.  He did what he had to do.
You're right, the rioters shouldn't have brought guns and just stayed homeHowever, way to deflect from my original point that this video isn't anything like what happened there. Yawn.
Does he also not have free speech. Can we not voice are opinions without threat of violence?
Agreed. Hurting random civilians in America isn‚Äôt going to make anyone feel different about civilians being hurt in Palestine.
They‚Äôll wait until some terrified driver whose vehicle is getting surrounded with people yelling and banging on their car to pop some shots off, then they‚Äôll show up
Fuck that riots are illegal. How about not threatening someone with a gun just because they are on opposite sides of the riot or protest? If you can be baited into being shot then so be it dumbass.
Why did the police just sit back and watch it all happen ? They could have stepped in so much earlier.
I want that thing you're smoking.
What a moron, this needs Benny Hill music.
You forgot the missles being shot at them by Hamas
Were you even going to before? Lol
An all in one parachute/life vest would be awesome.Pull once to inflate life vest, pull twice to deploy parachute.Would be one thick ass package tho.Btw you do know that it's legal to bring your own parachute on board?
If it was a Jewish kid he would have been dead
"He ain't going nowhere now!" - immediately proceeds to go somewhere
I wonder when Protestants (any) will finally get that being annoying and antisocial isn‚Äôt helping them. Imagine large group of people with flags/ banners cleaning the streets? This will make headlines
They got bombarded with rockets when they were not showing any aggression toward hammas .  Why wld they not go  n guns blazing. All these articles bout poor civilians. They new hammas was going to attack warned no one cant move equipment and people like thst without being noticed. There part of it to.
You all are all forfeiting yalls right to live. If he had gassed it, I wouldn't blame him. A mob of ppl is attacking and actively chasing him. Yall think "protesting" gives yall the right to do anything, yall, please.
Get. Out. Of. The. Fucking. Road.
Again, very different definition there, `little danger` isn't one where you've a good chance of dying.And this is coming form an (ex-) rock climber.

What‚Äôs that old man suppose to do? Stay in his car and get attack by a mob? Do you know how frightening that must be ?!I‚Äôd get the fck out of there too
it‚Äôs official. i‚Äôm never voting democrat ever again. these people are psychos
Reginald DennyThe [footage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esCUEbmmE6s) of that should be required viewing in drivers ed.
Not sure I get the tactic - fuck everyone‚Äôs day up because you want to make a point.  Also looks like the same group of people at every one of these road block bullshit protests - no matter the cause, they look like they‚Äôre all from the same temp agency.
Old man's just getting assaulted for absolutely no good reason. Fuck these losers.
The middle of the street is not for pedestrians. You learn this very early on in development
I thought the rock he threw at the beginning was a camera
At least one of the people chasing rittenhouse was armed though
Why stop cars ..most likely that may happen, protest peaceful guys
I always think of the Rodney King riots. Truck driver gets pulled out of vehicle and almost murdered live on TV
If you let thrash in your country, your country becomes thrash.
Don‚Äôt bring a gun to a riot when you could have just stayed home.

What‚Äôs life without a little danger. Who wants to live safe at home behind 4 walls their whole life
Hindsight is always 2020Even when the PLO tried to manage Gaza for a period the situation of the two zones (west bank vs Gaza strip) creates more divide "you and us" that is a big example of why I don't think "2 states" would ever work, it's more of a 3 states if anything and I think given the option to the west bank to seperate, self manage and have a closer border with Israel vs keeping the weird state of today, most would rather and be better off with today's state due a brexit moment can happen and I think would be better for Israel no matter where that border exactly would be But basically I don't think the West Bank and Gaza would ever be happy to be under the same government as two separate zones and I don't see how a land connection would exist in my lifetime or even 100 years after.The only way I see any of this resolved starts with deliberate changes to the education system in Gaza to value life and not worship death for a cause as much and talk about people as people not groups at odds probably needs to be more secular
Lmao. I love the people chasing him down the road like they think they‚Äôre the fucking T-1000.
imagine having the temerity to drive a CAR on a ROAD
Ok let‚Äôs caveat that there‚Äôs no context to the buildup. No idea why he got out of his car, or why she ran up and started hitting it.Complete shitshow. Cops do NOTHING of value until he‚Äôs surrounded and being beaten, then he takes out his gun in righteous self defense (would have been a justified shooting just so we‚Äôre all clear), and then they detain him. Hilarious
I don‚Äôt know how about get the fuck out of the street you morons
aren‚Äôt pilots supposed to be in communication with a tower to avoid this kind of situations?(It‚Äôs a real question I don‚Äôt know a shit about planes)
so when has making someone fear for their life while in a several ton hunk of moving metal worked out well? Its simple, someone drives thru something, gtfo. Im not saying its ok to drive thru protests or protestors, but when you literally give someone a reason to fear for their life by say, having several 10s of people crowd around their car and start punching and kicking it and trying to get inside. Its just asking for something horrible to happen. Say you even somehow manage to separate them from the car, has THAT worked out? usually people get mob mentality and gravely injure the person. Its better to have everyone get the fuck out of the way and let them be gone from the space where they can hurt people or be hurt.
‚ÄúHe not going nowhere now!‚Äù *drives away effortlessly*
They don‚Äôt know how to protest. Just grotesque language, hate and anti semitism.
Looks like they learned from hamas and created a blockade. Learn from the best
I always support the driver in cases like these.Ruining everyone else's day and pissing them off is the worst way to gain sympathy for your cause.
I think we are talking about a different kind of stoned lol
Tear gas AOE attack would be useful when tackling this raid, just have the car driver tank the damage while the tear gas mages activate their abilities
Damn the police were the real saviours here. The guy created a situation where there was no good outcome. Also if you are protesting as a group don't let people like this provoke you to and attack as a mob. Somebody is going to get killed and you don't want to spend rest of your life in prison or get shot.
It's pretty sad. Not even a KR fan but the literal fucking court evidence says that his case is nothing like what we just watched. Quite the opposite. Just gonna get downvoted by madkidsEdit: to the people downvoting me, fuck you. KR was a dumbass but he was literally chased, someone fired a gun in his direction, a pedophile attacked him around a vehicle, and then HE started shooting. It's nothing like this video and the original commenter is a dipshit.If you don't believe me, go watch the entire trial and look at the evidence like I did. It's publicly available. You have Google you lazy bums.
Minneapolis has become a shit hole after the George Floyd incidents. Lived there for years and it definitely isn‚Äôt what it used to be. It wasn‚Äôt perfect, but it wasn‚Äôt this.
It's Minneapolis, didn't do shit last time either.
yup, very dangerous stunt
Actually just watched a special about Hamas...it was interesting. Found out the US pushed that election in 2006. Neither Isreal or PLO wanted it to happen because they knew Hamas would win.
No respect for any group that goes into public traffic to "protest" for any cause.
I'd be in the same position, though I would have been more aggressive getting away.... I'm not getting pulled out of my vehicle by a crowd of people.
Stay out of the road then.
Film me up, daddy!
Why can‚Äôt law enforcement control these protests? Can‚Äôt they just have a system where the police will escort sanctioned protests and protect the participants in exchange for keeping things under control and off public roads?
Agreed!
Glad he made it out alive.
Listen to the martyrmade podcast by Darryl cooper (Fear and Loathing in the New Jerusalem #1-6) on Spotify.
Old guy was terrified. This is disgusting and not going to get anyone on your side. Remember the Floyd riots and the FedEx driver that dragged a guy. I hope the old guy gets help for his trauma and the protestors get counseling for their aggression.
His first part of the plan was to control the hostages, sometimes people act ways you never expect
Literally the reverse based on all of the court documents but okay.
Unfortunately none of the Arab countries like Palestinians... it's only lip service.. UAE, Egypt, Saudi Arabia rather have business relations with Isreal.. Saudi Arabia was hours away from recognizing Isreal and having an Embassy in Jerusalem... the rulers are puppets of USA...Egypt and Jordan live off US charity.. don't expect to change anytime soon.. they rather have Palestinians anhilated than raise their voices against Isreal.... in the West you have criticism of Isreal being labeled as antisemitism... they rather have Isreal comit genocide in the name of self-defense than have pro Palestinian rallies wake up the masses to Isreali War Crimes.... when I or anyone criticize US foreign policy am I  being anti-Christian..because 70-85% of US population is Christian... Hell No...
Did you miss the part where he got out of his car and engaged the protestors, inserting himself into the situation.You draw to defend yourself. You don't find a situation to draw.
I‚Äôm gonna film you even harder! You ain‚Äôt gonna outfilm me!
You filming me???? I‚Äôm gonna film you! I‚Äôm gonna film you even harder!
I‚Äôve seen this video so many times. And I will never not stop to watch it.

No wonder when a commercial airliner dive into the ocean no one survives, they provide no parachute
Idk how well this is enforced, I have family that does it recreationally and I was allowed to ride along with the pilot before but I wasn‚Äôt geared up at all. Does the type of plane matter or is it any plane skydivers use?
Shoes stayed on
Phew, so happy to hear this.
Lol. Lmao even‚ÄúDamn we got a rally for something? Better bring my sexuality flag cuz that‚Äôs literally the only thing I have going for me. Wdym this doesn‚Äôt have anything to do with the rally? Wdym everyone here hates me now? Wdym I‚Äôm being disrespectful? Wdym I‚Äôm stupid?‚Äù
The horrible thing is Israel is nearly enacting the same kind of war they were victim to in the time of Holocaust only Islamic countries might have less tolerance for how long it can and could go on for. The west will suffer the war of the middle east. It's a terrifying thought. To concede at will, is to admit defeat, apperently.
Rekt
Also wearing parachutes so they also survived
You agree with a protest group or not. If not, stay away. Seeth into social media or something. Going to the protest with a gun is inviting the kind of trouble this guy is in.

A pro Palestine event in Skokie is like having a Chicago Bears parade in Green Bay. Provocative to say the least.
If this video is the one in superior wi, everyone made it out just fine
Have fun in prison, dipshit.
Do you know how aid is usually handled by not-for-profit organizations, lets say a soup kitchen inside a country even the US gets donations of food, water, money to feed to it's local community of less fortunate, if that was intercepted by by the armed forced or the government and they decide what to do with it even due it was designated to a specific need, that would kinda be outrageous  or say you donate to your local church or other organization and the army/gov intercepts it and decides it's now theirs to do what they will, you probably won't think that is ok.
Don't you have to take yourself out of the gene pool to become a nominee?
You and I we have very different dictionaries on our shelves with regards to the definition of `fun`  :)
This is exactly how one can defend against a mob of unhinged, violent people.
What about the people on the ground where the plane crashed?
Yeah looks like they were getting ready to set up something. Now I'd be all freaked out about the plane plummeting to the ground just above me
It is not 1943...it is 2023... Hitler got away with the genocide of Jews... genocide of Palestinians will not happen in 2023...no matter how much Netanyahu wants...
I already had zero intention on skydiving, this just absolutely confirmed that.
Exactly.  He jumped out of the car and started chasing people who turned on him. Then he pulled a gun.
&gt;the average age is 17. Most don‚Äôt live to an old ageAccording to the world bank, the life expectancy is 74.4. In contrast the United States life expectancy is 77.28. Average age isn‚Äôt low because all the adults are being killed off ya goof.
Hamas was elected to office in, I believe in 2006, which was also the last election held.  I don't believe the citizens of Palestine are rooting for the terrorists.

Amen. Hence the title of my initial listing. I pray for my family and for everyone that cooler heads may prevail.
It's a forever cycle bro. Countries do evil stuff and sell weapons because it makes them money. Then they encourage people to fight eachother to sell more weapons. Then people in that country continue fighting and you see crazy people showing up everywhere.And the cycle continues. Hopefully things calm I agree but yeah it's getting scary because now the weapons they sell eachother are very scary. It's kind of scary knowing that a world war could start any day.

Let's hear your version then, jacktruck. Or did you just do a dispute drive-by and have nothing to dispute his claims other than your empty words.Waiting...
Seems kinda close to the cliff side
Russia did bomb a hospital in Ukraine
Reddit won't let me edit for some reason and i fast forwarded a little at 1st lol why did he even get out of his car and go after that lady?
Imagine telling some kid about this, who is making minimum wage, and about to buy a bag of pot in an hour.
That makes at least two of us
I love how the cop did absolutely nothing until he pulled out his gun to defend himself he was seriously just sitting there letting him get attacked by the mob the whole thing is a shit show
Help me understand how if Hamas I'd the govt as you claim, they are "stealing" aid? If it's true they are the govt (and I'm not sure they are) wouldn't they be responsible for distributing the aid. Wouldn't they be responsible for running everything....if they are the govt?Who else would be responsible?
But they don‚Äôt float! We could build a bridge out of him‚Ä¶
I agree üíØ with your opinion!Also the cartel right now are ruining my people. I do believe Mexico and the U.S. should get together and punish just them instead of everyone for what they are doing to ruin many countries right now. But I do believe to punish just the cartel repeatedly and make it to where any new people looking to take over would be foolish to do so out of fear. Supposedly the wall is because of Venezuelan people who are running out of fear from their country because of what's happening there. I still believe punishing the problem, not all of the people for the actions of a few. I don't believe war will fix this problem, rather a very strategic mission of handling the problem (people) who are causing all of the issues and pain via raids, detainment, extreme sanctions etc to solve the problems. Believe in the processes that is many hundreds of steps before war. As of now zero is being done about that either. The battles that are happening over seas now regardless of who is or was in the wrong should have never started at war/invasions. Now many countries possibly may be drawn into war and a lot of pissing matches are going on now to show who is superior. This again will show war 1st is never the answer. I personally can't tell my story locally to this day. I dare not raise an American flag along with a Mexican flag on my house knowing what will happen to my family now if I chose to do so. I'm not stupid enough to get my stupid on and do it without knowing the reprocussions of doing that 1st without thinking. I'm smart enough to know that drastic move is not the answer and if I'm truly as stupid as Atlas says I am, then why can't they do the same thing over seas. What happens over there could drastically effect my family again if another idiotic leap 1st mind decides to take out grievances out on the U.S.. but enough countries are that close to jumping now against us that I see history happening all over again. Endless needless neverending war, because I truly believe the next world war will be the last one. But yet I am the one who's is stupid. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The pm doesn't want a two state solution. That's why he has been funding Hamas.
Ah yes, the most viewed video on the internet.
Apparently yes considering that they were in skydiving gear and also were in a skydiving plane
what
50 % of the Gaza population is children. Mainly due to Israel attacks
Israels PM has funded and supported Hamas to prevent a moderate palistinian government because he opposes a two state solution
Nah its based off The Forest.Jokes aside, it's actually based off a wave of German Cannibal films from the early-mid 2000's.
Yes, correct.
Why is it always the person with clothes that don't fit being the shit disturber
Not sure, not my video. Looks like they‚Äôre trying to follow the action since it‚Äôs a wide shot. There are multiple angles of this video.
As you should. Like despite my opinions I dont believe the Jewish folk non native to the land should leave Isreal. I think they just need to integrate everyone as equals in the country. They are all very capable people there and it would become a very rich country as many including myself would be interested in working there if things weren't nuts.Very sorry to hear about your experience. Experiences like that shape many because it teaches them how evil war is. That's why current wars are so evil because they just press a button and don't even get to see what they've done on a different side. Btw in Mexico they weren't fighting the cartels. They were training and arming them.
They need to be burnt at the stake
Extreme.
What is up with the person filming the security camera??
If you look off to your north you can see the beautiful Great Lake Superior!
looks like best case scenario atleast with a gun being involved.
What a shitshow.
That is the dumbest thing ever surface tension is faster than that
Apparently they also know how to drop a rock in water to see how deep it is.. witchcraft..
üëç thanks
I get it. But I do agree even the cartel should be punished, it's just them in a very strategic mission and it should be dealt with that way. Don't kill all Mexican citizens, just target the cartel. This holds true for anything in life for any country. Go after those responsible, don't approach with a machine gun with a spray and pray you get a bad guy or 2. My mother died during her attack. My father was an illegal who was told to go fight for your country and when you come back you will be granted permanent citizenship automatically in a country that used to be ours. Life changed for my family completely because of war and racism. They are both still run very rampid now today. It doesn't make sense to me. My brother and I were alone for a bit and still don't talk to this day due to what happened back then. I just see people like Atlas every day telling me stupid for not believing that this is the way it should be. Blaming my education level for believing that war should never be the 1st immediate action. That to me holds deep meaning to me. Whomever is is the wrong, punish those few for their crimes. Don't punish an entire people for it. The right want to punish me for my ethnicity, but even thou I know how wrong they are by historical fact live and in person, I don't hate them. I pray for them. But I don't hate them.
Always look at both sides of an issue and get ALL the context.
Yeah you can say that about literally anything
A US carrier strike force alone has more firepower than most countries.

I mean they all had parachutes? Right? their ok?, I mean one guy might've gotten a little squished but yk helmets n shit
I asked the same thing..lol. This is at least the 4th time I‚Äôve seen it in as many days.
Why has this been posted about 5 times in the last two days. The clip is like 3 years old.
I work in aviation and I feel like this MUST have been a set up for a trick or terribly untrained pilots. You have radio guards up when skydivers are in the area so planes don‚Äôt fly through their free falls‚Ä¶ either the planes didn‚Äôt do that, were ignoring them, or they intentionally set up for a stunt and the lower plane was in the higher ones blind spot with poor coms with each other‚Ä¶
Sorry to hear about your experience bro. Never be afraid to ask questions. But just remember that often the truth will be very hard to find on regular news. They will tell you that this started because of the hamas attack. But they won't tell you about the killings that have been happening daily before that as they have been stealing homes regularly.But the best thing you can do is believe no one, including myself, but hear all the sides. Ask yourself why were guys like Nelson Mandela labeled as terrorists in the west until they couldn't maintain the apartheid no longer in South Africa.It's funny because they raped and pillaged Mexico and stole tons of their land, now they cry because Latinos are becoming majority in their historic land. On this topic do some independent research. Read about isreals involvement in Latin America. You will be surprised. Here is just a tiny reference point:https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-08-30-mn-1305-story.html
How did they know the camera would be facing him when it hit the water
But these actions may effect my family again here in the States. I see a repeat of things to come. I already see it now with people wanting to build a wall around Mexicans oh excuse me I mean Mexico.
Literally everything I said you can search up. I even gave all examples of perspectives from prominent Jewish people. Now please tell me Einstein, Chompsky, Finkelstein, Bernie Sanders, Gabor Mate are all anti-semetic for being pro-palestine.
Thank you for your help. I get this point.
I'm Mexican and the same happened to my people in the battles of Texas. My people were slaughtered including women, children and babies to the hands of people who just didn't care who died to take over land that was not theirs. Many of my family descendants including babies were killed in the battle at Goliad. That's why I believe war is not a 1st thought but a last desperate attempt to stop a wrong only. I'm 100% Mexican and very proud of it. But I did grow up surrounded by hatred and racism where I live. Zero is said in films lor podcasts about what happened. When a slow minded person tells me to read a book or listen to a podcast it makes me truly sick ü§¢ to my stomach. I can still see that same persons beliefs is the same belief of someone who stopped my mother on the road while driving, surrounded her car, raped her and beat her with me watching when I was 5 while my Mexican father was fighting in Vietnam. So atlas globes challenging me doesn't help me. I NEED calm explanations of why, not for me to grow up. I believe this shouldn't happen at all. I just wish to understand. I believe the 1st stone was cast on this occasion only, not throughout history. Just this occasion. When retaliation happens, why scream why?
No atlas might just be frustrated because it's madness right now. Like there is very dark evil things happening in the world. You are right to ask questions.The easiest way for me to explain would be to explain logistics. Say isreal wants to silence someone or hurt someone that hurt them. They can do an air strike on the person's entire neighborhood. But if the Palestinians want to do something back they have to get past the wall and literally run around to whatever is closest. So once they are inside they are pretty much already dead because the power of the Isreali military is vastly greater than them. So to them everyone past the wall hates them and wants them dead, especially if they are young adults as there is mandatory military service.As for your next question of why would you do this when you know your side is going to get wrecked?There is a very famous quote from a confederate leader during the US War of independence. "Give me liberty or give me death." A lot of people will do crazy things to be free.
Not a single girl witnessing this in person. Internet goblins however.

All that open space and two planes manage to hit each other. Humans really are capable of anything
It is when the planes are intentionally flying in tight formation.
It wasn‚Äôt a ‚Äúgust of wind‚Äù, it was a loss of spatial orientation by one or both pilots flying in formation to simultaneously drop skydivers who planned to meet up in freefall.
Almost had a good case of natural selection right there
Ok. So again I go back to my question of why invade a music festival and slaughter 100s. If something truly needed to happen and I'm not saying it did, why not something more strategic? The whole thing of war unless necessary is too far off for me to grasp. Someone breaks into my house and I will kill that person to protect my family. I won't kill them and go after their entire families and neighbors who have zero to do with it.  It's strategic for me, I wouldn't be stupid enough to punish millions for the actions of one. I have another person answering me called Atlas something trying to tell me I'm too stupid to think like this and war is needed. I don't believe war is necessary until every single alternative has been exercised and completed üíØ. I guess I am too stupid to understand. I guess I should have the belief of bomb 1st then ask for help when everything has been taken away from my family. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Thrill seeker getting slapped by the cock of death.
Why throw the first stone? LMFAO!!!!!!
Just breath bro... I condemned both sides for the killing of innocent civilians. I have been very critical of what Israel is doing. I hope you find peace man.
How old are you?
This is what the other commenter is trying to tell you. This fight didn't start with the latest incursion.
In the states you did have something similar. The war against the British for independence. A lot of the confederate leaders were extremely right wing, that's why you constantly have people wanting to topple their statues. In times of war people often vote for the extreme right because they think of them as more effective in war times. The moment that US got its freedom you saw more liberal leaders show up because then the focus shifted to bettering their society.
What's the gene pool on that island look like?
Just not seeing why this should even be an attack with a possibility of war. Why throw the first stone? Even without reading a book or listening to a podcast I understand that.
No problem. The media is very scary now. Like when it comes to even the most basic issue democrats and Republicans will argue and waste millions of tax payer dollars to argue their side. When it comes to war they are completely unified. Like where the hell did they find 105 billion for the new military aid package for Ukraine and Isreal? Right now China, Russia and US are all moving war ships in the region. In the thirst of feeding the military economy they might trigger a world war. Because Isreal has the 3rd holiest mosque in Islam, this is a very unifying issue for the middle east.The worst treatment of any group though is the Christians. Like they get along really well with the Muslims there but the western world pretends that Palestinan Christians don't exist. Recently the Patriach of Jerusalem did a press conference accusing Isreal of war crimes and the next day Isreal bombed the 3rd oldest church in Christianity. It's wild that neither the conference or the bombing got any attention. That Patriarch should be a bigger deal than the Pope for Christians.
And what do you call what Israel is doing and has been doing to the Palestinian people for the past 75 years. You cannot say they kill innocent civilians without also condemning what Israeli has done first, obviously you have a problem with history when you don‚Äôt know who are the oppressors and the oppressed are. Hamas were only resisting, what do expect them to do. FUCK ISRAEL AND ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS THEM! Bloodthirsty monsters committing massacre after massacre for decades then cry like little bitches when they are on the offensive so that world can side with them. No one will side with them expecting savages who like to kill innocent children. It‚Äôs funny you think they would learn from what happened tot hem in the holocaust but here they are doing worse than hitler ever has. Karma is bitch.
So why are the teaming up behind the call of sheer jihad of attacks in the U.S.? And why not release all the United States citizens immediately they they are holding. Not just 2. I have trouble grasping these facts
If you think this is possible you have no concept or understanding of war... so I would start by reading a few books on it or maybe even a few movies, or podcasts. That will help you understand more.
Thank you
Hamas has no reason to attack in the USA. They are fighting a war with Israel. Not the USA. This is basically a war that has been going on for 70 years. I don't believe that "Hamas" are terrorists in the traditional sense of Islam.
Thank you for your help
I see. But 15x to 40x vs millions is very achievable if people truly want this to stop no? If we had that type of vermin (Hamas) in the states, it would be a quick fix/resolution. So what is the other side? Is it they want war or ethnic cleansing ie: Hitler? Didn't they see the film or read the book on how that turned out? I just want some understand and clarification. So far no one has helped.
1. Based on fall time, it's about 70 ft. drop. :-O2. The rock drop was to break the surface tension of the water.
It's good that you are trying to understand the situation. The truth is that there are a few things to understand.First, Palestine is an occupied country. They are completely Walled off and almost every basic right you can think of is stripped from them and controlled by Isreal. This is actually not even a conspiracy, literally type in "what is gaza" on YouTube or Google, even go on the most right wing video you can find and think for yourself if you would want to live there. By many accounts it is apartheid at the least or a concentration camp. Many of the people within that prison were born there, their only crime being that they are Palestinian.Second you have to understand why? This is where history plays a narrative. The easiest way is to simplify is that Europe was racist as hell in the past (can argue still is). After WW2 them along with US and Canada rejected a lot of Jewish refugees and preferred them to be sent to Isreal instead. This was then justified by saying it's their ancestral homeland as mentioned in the Bible. Now here is where it turns into an argument, on one hand did jews live in the area? Yes. Did they live even before the mass migration? Yes. Did many Palestinians (jews, Muslims and christians) welcome the refugees? Yes. But US and Britain armed many of militias that had formed which followed a political ideology called Zionism which believe in a Jewish state. This was highly controversial, even the most famous Jewish person at the time, Einstein said the Zionist leader at the time was closer in ideology to nazis and that he wanted no part of joining a fascist regime that was forming. A lot of very prominent jews agreed with Einstein and said the same. Regardless based on the idea that 2000 years ago it was a Jewish country the zionists began to justify their belonging and waged a civil war against the Christians, Muslims and jews that opposed them. Remember that the area was peaceful at the time, so the existing inhabitants were not all on favor of the mass migration. Now comes the last part which is relevant today. In order to become a "democracy" they needed to create a Jewish majority. So they actively cleared out hundreds of villages carrying out many massacres one notable one being the one Einstein mentioned I think it was called dier yassin. When you fact check me you'll find it pretty easily. And then pushed out 700k to 1 million of Palestinians out of their homes. Because it's a small country they have been forever expanding and most of the world is pretty pissed at their disregard of international law. Palestinians have tried to no avail to get some sort of solution but Isreal and US block everything and blame it on the Palestinians. So finally to get to the current fighting. There has recently been an insane amount of settlements and home evictions of Palestinians. The racism in Isreal is getting to insane heights and there is regular rallys throughout the cities chanting for death to all Arabs etc. Again this stuff is readily available so go ahead and search. Alot of these illegal settlements are also pretty much little militias so they are heavily armed and there has been countless killings and settler terrorism going on. The Palestinians are very angry, and because they are all trapped in two different sections they can't really communicate with eachother. The one actively facing all of the terrorism from Isreali settlers doesn't have hamas so they really don't fight back at all besides random fights here and there. Hamas on the other hand is the government in the open air prison of gaza. They have been getting increasingly angry because of their treatment and the treatment of the others within the west bank.So recently they invaded Isreal through a prison break and so in their rage they attacked anyone they found within the closest settlement. Here is where it gets controversial. Obviously civilians should not be targeted by anyone but hamas has a similar justification as Isreal in these attacks. Isreal says that if an apartment building has even one hamas soldier bombing it is fair game. Hamas feels that because everyone is mandated to be part of the isreali defense forces everyone is the army. There was some news of them beheading babies but those claims where then taken back from the white house and the cnn reporter who made them. But they most definitely kidnapped numerous civilians and took them back to gaza. They said that they wanted to do a prisoner exchange because Isreal has thousands of Palestinians in prison without charge.So now the real question is, does Isreal want to get rid of hamas or do they just want more territory. That will be easy to spot though, because if you start seeing Isreal say things like "wanting to create a buffer zone" it'll be obvious it's more about land. As for deaths, it's vastly disproportionate. More isrealis die from peanut allergies than they do from rockets. Again fact check this. I just hope that the war mongering can end and they just slowly start giving Palestinians nationality. What's done is done in terms of settler colonization. But the residents both Jewish, Muslim and Christian deserve better now. They should just create a representative democracy giving each religious group a percentage of the vote. We already know the 3 groups can live fine together because not only were they fine before 1948 but they are fine in all other areas of the world. It's just whenever this garbage comes up do you see tensions rise everywhere.Sorry for long explanation. If you want a more indepth explanation read books or listen to interviews from Dr. Norm Chompsky or Dr. Norman Finkelstein. Both are Jewish so don't have a perceived isreali or Muslim bias.
Hamas isn't a few hundred fighters. It's estimated as possibly 15k - 40k... nobody knows for sure. Some say more like 50k now as this event has encouraged ppl to join. Hamas isn't exactly "vermin" in the eyes of most of the Gazan ppl as you say. I think you need to try and see the other side of this issue, bc  it will help you understand it better. Cheers.
The official story is that they were trying to hijack the plane because there was $32 million on board. The pilot miscalculated his descent. Everyone survived but the $32 mill is still unaccounted for.
Lmao these Trans people think Palestine supports lgbtq.. Lmaooooooo
Jews were there first, my point, and there is only one evil it's hamas they caused all of this
None of us have a problem with history, we have a problem with innocent civilians being killed. What Hamas did was disgusting. Fuck Hamas. What Israel is doing now is also disgusting. It's not hard.
Like the hollow head guy after jumping into shallow water

He put a little too much focus on spin rather than distance, that was pretty close.
FAA requires everyone in dive planes, including pilot, to wear parachutes. Everyone survived this crash, including pilots.
Came rather close to leaving some brain tissue on that cliff.More proof, if any were needed, that the human brain isn't fully developed until age 25.
lol dude take a break from defending Israel, you don‚Äôt get exhausted deflecting blame of everything they do? Jesus Christ
You would think, but I remember one in Florida where no one made it out except the guy who was already hanging on to the wing strut.In this case, everyone survived. One pilot was able to land (though the plane never flew again) and the other one managed to bail out. He'd only ever made one or two jumps in his life.
Except for the pilots of the two planes. Were they wearing parachutes?

Except the conversation is about Israel which isn't synonymous with Jews. Far better informed than you.
What more do you need know besides the fact that Israel (the powerful nuclear armed state with worldwide support) is indiscriminately bombing an open air prison full of innocent people (who are majority children)?
I'm sure that the average person on this website has a panic attack crossing a busy sidewalk with the whiny reactions they come with, the moment they see someone doing something slightly spectacularYou're all like Kyle's cousin from South Park personified
Just a few more feet and we would be on a different sub
I‚Äôd guess yes, but it probably wouldn‚Äôt come out working though.
Credit for the creative thinking.Hamas is the government in Gaza and has wide support from the population, they run everything, the schools, construction, water etc, they steal and control all aid, distributing it as they see fit. They are the main armed group, there are a couple of small groups by name controlling weapons, but they are mostly by name, would mostly do what Hamas says, they are names for convenience of blame shifting.So a citizen's arrest of a member of an armed group of the government by someone who has nothing is highly unlikely. The best chance is some Intel on location and operations, it is life risking, some of that exists.
"We do this all the time. We just don't know what happened for sure that caused this."Uhhh maybe three full sized humans out on the wing could‚Äôve upset the balance.

There‚Äôs like a 98% chance the guy at the register doesn‚Äôt even know about Israeli apartheid and is confused about this woman freaking out on him.
That's why only professionals do this kind of thing because they know how to land in water properly
Israel was certainly not there before anybody. And no Jews where not there before anyone. And Israel has killed far more Palestinians than Hamas has Israeli citizens. The idea that Israel is the lesser evil is absurd.

Palistinian Jew and before that Jews of other nationalities there are still Jews who consider themselves palistinian including some in Gaza. Of the land that makes up modern day Israel only 10% was bought. Of which 75% was bought from British colonials. Meaning only 2.5% of Israels current land was legitimately obtained.

you're not going to fall in front of the plane.all of them were *instructors*.and the pilots had emergency parachutes.  This article is more than 9 years old  Wisconsin skydivers jump to safety after two planes collide  None of the nine skydivers or two pilots sustained serious injury when the two planes collided in midair Saturday evening  [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/wisconsin-skydivers-two-planes-collide](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/wisconsin-skydivers-two-planes-collide)
Absolutely terrifying.  Glad nobody perished.
360 degrees camera. You can select your image in software afterwards.
I mean if you're going to be in a plane crash, this is about the most ideal way to do so. Everyone's already wearing skydiving gear, and there's plenty of time before hitting the ground to take action.
Everyone survived. It‚Äôs miraculous, really I‚Äôm glad that no one on the ground (who had nothing to do with this tomfoolery) was harmed
I attended Horry County schools from middle to high school and this is absolutely true. They hire back teachers after being fired for being arrested for things like domestic violence or touching their dick in an Uber (true story). Bus drivers are even worse.
‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs 10 years old.
Low speed crash and they're skilled jumpers (note how they were gathering outside the plane--they're doing some sort of formation jump.)  Pilots of jump planes normally wear chutes, just because the one plane went in doesn't mean there was anyone on board when it went splat.
Does hating lgbt because you‚Äôre a shitty person or because your god told you to really matter?
I don't see how the camera stayed stabilized on him the whole time ...
But they‚Äôre not white

I didn't know him before college.  I was a freshman and had just joined the college when he died.  We had a few classes together.  To be fair I only knew him for maybe 6 months.  From what I could tell he was passionate about his faith and wanted to share it.  He had been on several mission trips with the college(it was a Christian college) and loved to share his faith.  I never saw it as bad or anything. The outreaches were normal and no one was harassed. Leading up to the event people who knew him better than I said he felt like he wasn't doing enough. He felt he needed to bring Christianity to everyone, if only so they knew what it was.  He was a nice guy, not a lie.  I just feel like the hype of the college got to him and radicalized his ideas.  Trust me, that college affects you. I was sad when I found out though.  The college held a memorial and it was revealed he knew he was pretty much going to die and that he accepted that.  Idk, it was odd when I would visit my friends in his hall and his dorm was just empty.
Yes, Exactly what the illegal Israeli occupiers have been doing this since 1948. The Palestinians are the ones being oppressed. You don‚Äôt seem to understand the root of the issue. This isn‚Äôt new, the Palestinians didn‚Äôt juts appear out of nowhere. Jewish Zionist from all over Europe came to occupy the land of Palestine. Learn your history.
Was he always like that or did he get worse later in life or what?
Yet these are the people standing up for them. People are so dumb
That water looks shallow.
No I'm sorry killing civilians is a war crime.

You know what‚Äôs not hard to do? Ending the slaughter of thousands of innocent people. And don‚Äôt give me the ‚Äúhuman shields‚Äù argument. If you want to use it, then show me one piece of evidence that shows a Palestinian complaining about Hamas forcing them to be a human shield.
Couldn't be a better "Mam this is a wendy's" moment even if at Mickey D's
Because religious beliefs are not 1:1 to political beliefs.
You HAVE to like us, but we don‚Äôt like you.
Ever tolerant.
Stop occupying their land so they can stop shooting rockets! This isn‚Äôt anything new. The illegal Israeli occupation has been since 1948. And the Palestinians have been resilient is resisting. As much as they have been trying, the Israelis cowards have not been able to get rid of the indigenous people of Palestine. What‚Äôs new now is that, now the world is now watching Israel commit genocide. They are being exposed for the vile maniacs that they are.
100% of skydivers will eventually die. Dangerous sport
"We want to be free from tyranny and oppression."* 2 seconds later"GET HIM! OPPRESS HIS BELIEFS!"The world is fucked.
Hamas did no such thing, no war crimes were committed from anyone except for the illegal Israeli occupiers. Hamas are resisting the ongoing massacre and genocide of their own people, the indigenous people of Palestine.
Stop shooting rockets so the airstrikes can stop. Not hard to do!
We all knew that what Hamas did was a war crime... now we must say the same thing about the war crimes Israel is committing.

That's certainly possible, but I doubt that's the logic that went through his head. He _looks_ like he's trying to be as overt about it as possible.It's also possible that he sees this as an attempt at deescalation too though. Hell he might not even be actually recording anything; some people change their tune when they know they're being recorded. Personally though, were that the case, I don't think that's a great tactic and I can certainly see why the mother would be offended at that especially given the circumstances.

Israel hadn't existed for nearly 3000 years and had only existed for 98 years. The idea that it was their land because of that is asinine
Wouldn't be a problem if Israel hadn't colonized there rather than settled in Europe would it. Apparently you think the solution is to arm Israel as they wage a genocidal war against the inhabitants of the land they want
Damn that's crazy bruv
Well, the hospital bombing didn't happen (it was their own rocket, not even close to 800 were killed), and the 1800 number is likely highly exaggerated, with a very high probability.
Amazing, you can‚Äôt make this shit up
Why I'm not surprised at all?
But it IS looting. Just because they left ‚Äúgifts behind‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean they didn‚Äôt steal. The ‚Äútrade‚Äù wasn‚Äôt agreed upon. They took the stuff without permission.
Well that was only a matter of time.
Must be nice to have such an easy life where this is what brings you down
Was never there land was jews land get your head out your ass terrorist supporters
Not just the right most of America thinks that and isreal needs are help there surround by terrorists and only genocide would be against the jews not the Palestinians that's all hamas wants is to kill jews for religious beliefs they can care less about land.
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to make a big deal of it‚Äù ~ making a big deal of it.
The sharks are getting a reality check: this isn't a situation for easy clout
Ya know of all the disaster scenarios that would likely boil up in your head while attempting to skydive, I didn't believe that contact with *another plane* would be high up on the list.
This some Istanbullshit!
I went to school with that guy.   Kinda made everyone sad but we knew it would happen.  Everyone begged him not to go.
Lmao it‚Äôs like in Russia they removed things that were blue and yellow because it might look like Ukraine flag

probably have a nuclear war

Truth. My "moderate" Muslim coworker refuses to use the company bathroom because we have a gay guy on our floor.
Yah, I have always thought it odd that my own country (Canada) will let in huge numbers of people who come from areas of the world where women are property and LGBTQ folks get stoned. Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.
Lol pretty much. I saw a group photo of some ladies saying "lesbians for Palestine", and below it someone had added "whales for whaling". Like, do these people not realize they would get stoned to death by these people? You can have sympathy for them, but you gotta realize they are not your friends.
The guy deserved a good kick in the balls

I imagine he meant more a "live and let live" attitude
Scum
As someone in the LGBT community, the arguments I‚Äôve had over this is insane. People seemingly jump to support whatever Instagram stories are telling them is good or bad and then have zero critical thinking skills to look further than that. Palastine is a nightmare for it‚Äôs gay citizens, I met one guy who grew up there as LGBTQ and couldn‚Äôt understand why there‚Äôs so much support
I mean who knows? At least the IRA know their time and place! /s
Cunts going to be cunts.
"I don't want to make a big deal" while making a big deal lol
As a foreign journalist (Cameraman), who spent 5 years based in Jerusalem (covering conflicts throughout the Middle East, Afghanistan and North Africa,), I can say that whilst the IDF/Israeli police have a bad track record regarding the killing of journailsts you are generally still better off wearing body armour. There have been many, clear occasions where the IDF have deliberately targeted people wearing PRESS 'flashes' as we call them, but amidst the total number of deaths in these engagements these are still exceptions (as unbelievable as that might sound), a number of the instances you listed were journalists who were engaged from at longer range or from the air which does mean they are harder to identify. Overall though, the feeling is still that it is safer to wear marked armour even though it doesn't always feel as reassuring as it might be.  In my case as a cameraman I'd reckon that they are more likely to shoot me for carrying a camera so I might as well wear armour.
Or British kids the police are top afraid of stopping
There‚Äôs a lot of instances of people chopping up footage and releasing it online to change a narrative. If someone I didn‚Äôt know came up to me screaming and recording I would for sure start recording as well. At least then I have the ability to release the uncut video.I‚Äôm surprised that this facility doesn‚Äôt have cameras.
I can‚Äôt imagine getting upset over colors. Jesus Christ we really need an asteroid strike.
Damn, it's almost like i dont base my ideas on who gets human rights on how good a person is
The amount of stupidity it takes, to crash into another plane in the air.
Yup, that's true.  Pre WWII, no one wanted Jews.
But if you actually connect all the dots, what do you get? Thats right‚Ä¶Star of David!
But that's what they've been doing and all they want. They don't want us to come there and bother them, they're not leaving the island to fuck with us. They just want to stay there and fuck themselves. Leave them alone
Because Muslims are really tolerant and welcoming no matter your sexual orientation or way of life
Celebrating the destruction of a prison fence and their brief relief from grief maybe? Projecting (#1 US policy) won't do you any good. You are just losing your humanity even more. Shame on you people
She was amazingly restrained.
Fuck missionaries.
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Like do yall know how much room the sky has.
Most of the closer "satellite" views you're used to are actually taken by small plane.
Not really. To have a good point, there should be a genocide. But there is none.
I know this is not your fault, cause you‚Äôre an employee, but I need Internet points so you have to stand here and listen to my conspiracy theory.
Good god some people are so fucking stupid.
You do realise saying ‚Äúfree Palestine‚Äù does nothing right ?
Since when was lgbt a core value of the country?
I would agree with you, except on the other hand let‚Äôs not pretend that the Muslims would be this riled up upon seeing an I.R.A. flag in the protest. It isn‚Äôt other flags being carried that‚Äôs the problem, it‚Äôs very specific other flags‚Ä¶
Let‚Äôs be honest, if this was some other non-Palestine-related flag, there wouldn‚Äôt be this issue.Let‚Äôs not pretend that such a dramatic, angered reaction is rooted in‚Ä¶ being upset over an I.R.A. flag being carried. We all know why the reaction was the way it was and where to attribute it.

Wait.. is Son's of the Forrest based of this island or something?
Archeological evidence puts the Jewish people in that area, including Jerusalem, long before the creation of Islam. The creation of the state of israel in 1948 was at the time of many other states being given their independence from Britain, France and others. So, to imply my thinking of this just began is quite false. Any argument that state of israels creation was illegal or false is also false. Then, any nations creation or independence was also be illegal as well . Britain being a victor in World War 2 seen fit to grant independence and the creation of israel as well. These changes were agreed  to internationally.  The state of israel has had to fight for its existence multiple times against multiple nations and terrorists factions . Conflict is not new to them, and neither is the hate. This brutality was visited on the Jewish people during World War 2 . The world had a slogan " never again". It has happened  again . Any action taken in defense of its people against a genocidal faction such as hamas is more than justified.  The cost paid by the hamas organization and its backers must be made high enough that any further combat will never happen.  The comments from israeli prime minister stated they will talk about this for generations. They should . It should be a warning to never attempt another attack or the cost paid will be too great to bear.  When cowards like hamas hide behind the general population, civilian casualties will occur.  Hamas wants this to try a sway public opinion to save their skins . The horrors of war visited on the people of gaza are of their own making. The Civilians are truly caught in the middle. If they voice opposition to hamas about using their building to launch rockets that person and their family would promptly the killed by hamas. If they hang around, they could be killed by an israeli air strike. Lose lose situation.  Both situations are of hamas making . Both are tragic.  One way or another hamas will be destroyed  weather its in a month or 10 years. Some of the Civilians are vocal supporters of hamas at that point they are a complict population. Can israel tell the difference ? Not at this time. Israel needs.to take over gaza  , run the schools to remove the hate drilled into the kids generation after generation. As was done in Germany after the war.  Multigenerational hate has to be ended . Golda Meir  had a quote. Peace will come when the Arabs love their children more than they hate us.  Still rings true today . They shovel their children's souls on to a fire of hate like coal in a furnace .

They‚Äôve been throwing gay people off buildings like it‚Äôs a sport but no one wants to hear that.

Human Rights! No, not like that! We meant for us!
Such is life
Yeah no offense .. probably not the place for it ‚Ä¶
Jews and Arabs have been killing each other long before the state of Israel.  You aren‚Äôt well informed.
They have taken more and more land from Palestinians and won't stop till they have wiped Palestine off the map.  It very much is genocide and fits the definition of it. "Collage kids" just proves how ignorant you are. And thanks for admitting aiding Israel a holy war and therefore is not based on reason. Christmas will twist any facts, spew any propaganda necessary to support it.
Adults cant be this stupid...right guys? This is just a bit?
I think that might be to have proof in case the other person recording  cuts or selectively edits their video, We've all seen cases where a video gets posted and enrages everyone then when more context is given or an uncut video released the opinion switches.
Yes that‚Äôs is what WI stands for.
People are so uneducated. They don‚Äôt even know which side they‚Äôre on.
&gt;Jewish subversion techniquePeople who think there is a grand conspiracy have never had to run a project. Try to get more than one person to read a project document... Impossible.
McChickens for Israel! Tell me people don't deserve $20+ an hour to deal with the general public and I'll tell you you're dead wrong.
The whole Tony the Tiger conspiracy goes even deeper than you can imagine. WHY IS THE MAINSTREAM MEDIA NOT SHOWING THIS:[https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=95371&amp;page=1](https://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=95371&amp;page=1)
yeah esp bc in a lot of school districts the bus company is hired out. the school probably is hearing about this for the first time. not an excuse but i‚Äôd be walking into the bus company offices yelling, personally.
Not only Tony the Tiger, but there are no tigers in Kenya, yet the Global Jewish Kabal wrote a song about that lie. Why would they do that unless they were trying to brain wash the kids into supporting their evil plot.[https://youtu.be/FbYtASAakAI?si=WoR2NTzGQikKebF3](https://youtu.be/FbYtASAakAI?si=WoR2NTzGQikKebF3)
These progressives are in for a rude awakening if they think they're going to find an ally in very religious conservatives.  They're having a "but I can change them!" moment, yet it's going to backfire.
Connect the dots people!!! What dots? You know!
Nor does possessing wealth haha
Wisconsin not Michigan
Yeah in the article linked above it mentions the only time they landed and walked on the island was 1967 and members of the party took bows and spears. In subsequent trips they were never allowed on the island again.
Wow it‚Äôs as if Muslims dislike LGBTQ people, and that this hasent been proven multiple times.
It's only from October 16-20th tho /s
Why does the title have to say black mother.  Why not just  outraged  mother or mother.
The quintessential agony of being black. I cry, I bleed, I get scared, I love, and I hate. However, if I dare show any of those emotions then I am the problem.I am expected to be able to "rise up" at a moment's notice and overcome all of my struggles with ease. Which I have done do and will continue to due for reasons unknown to myself but it is so exhausting.
Well yeah, she‚Äôs hungry and those sandwiches are delicious. But she‚Äôs not happy about it and you shouldn‚Äôt be either.
They are professionals at gaslighting black parents. They look down at you and your family regardless of how smart you are. They always know better than you and anything you say sounds like static to them.Edit: I felt so unwelcome they even had the school resource officer intimidating my family. He would unbutton the bottom side of his coat where his holster was on every time he saw us. Took a year but I made him like me in the end that being said its insane that I had to go through such lengths not to be harassed.
Lol, no. The common ground isn't anti-Semitism, it's being *against* apartheid and the Palestinians being genocided. Although, the Palestinians aren't really against Genocide in general, just when it's happening to them.
Sorry
I do. But I will admit I'm a minority on the left, and often a pariah.I just don't want to be thrown off a building yo.
There's a time and place for everything. This is not the time nor the place to display your pride for the community, unfortunately. Common sense is completely gone in this day and age.
gone to her tiktok and wow, the videos after this is insane. the whole thing that happened is insane and crazy.
This is indeed terrifying
As a driver, my first question is was the driver following their paperwork? Second is what is the policy for dropping of kindergarteners? My district will not let us drops off kids without an approved adult or older sibling. If the driver was following policy and their paperwork, then it's not on them, and more likely a filing error. I can't count the number of times I've gotten wrong names, incorrect stops, or wrong student numbers. I've also had whole sections of my route missing.
Dude it‚Äôs literally like:üáÆüá±: ‚ÄúOur government supports the LGBTQ+ community.‚Äùüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è: ‚ÄúNOOOOOOO!

News to him...
ikr? like what was bro thinking lmfao
Just a reminder that Hamas is at this very moment holding children and women that they kidnapped as hostages. Not adults, not soldiers, not combatants but women and children. Hamas needs to release all hostages first before anything else can happen. With this act of taking hostages Hamas is holding all Palestinians hostage as well.
I'm a school bus driver and one of the most nerve wracking times of the year is the first couple weeks because little kids don't always know where to go. That's also why we require all kinders to be met by an approved adult or older sibling, so shit like this doesn't happen.
What did that person expect? For them to be validated at a Palestine rally?
Yeah, go give a random cashier grief over this.
Where‚Äôs the queers for Palestine group at?
I'd bet money Saudi isn't.  and Egypt and Jordan are unlikely too.
It‚Äôs so crazy that everyone‚Äôs immediate response to being recorded by someone with a phone is to then pull out their phone and return phone record that person before they even know what‚Äôs happening
Ah yes, McIsrael
No, therefore next week is gonna be Horror County Kids Deportation, fun for Halloween
This is what I came here to ask and was happy it was the first thing I read.
OMG she's upset!! Somebody had better help the poor woman interpret wrappers on her burgers better! Quickly before she sues someone.
Why is it relevant that she is black? Any parent would freak out if their young child was just left alone and not with a responsible adult. irrespective of their ethnic background. Race shouldn't come into it.
It's impossible. I'm ex-muslim and it turns out all these "moderates" are actually not so "moderate"
And no Christian don‚Äôt pray for the end times, we just understand the word.
Aiding Israel is the duty of anyone who‚Äôs ever read the Bible anywhere, at anytime.  Not just the ultra right.  And stop with scream Genocide, Genocide , Genocide.  Hamas are the ones who look for genocide.  Dumb ass lefties just use the word and don‚Äôt even know what it means.  It just sounds bad.  Hence you throwing it around.  Israel does not have the intent of taking out innocent civilians.  Therefor I this not genocide.  Learn something will ya.  Stop with the propaganda.  Stupid fucking college kids.
The race was pretty irrelevant in the title this case. But, what a horrible situation
I thought they were bestest friends everü•∞
LOL I UNDERSTAND THAT AND AGREE.  You are not following me at all.  I was very narrowly arguing that the taking of the bows was not exactly looting the village.  I give up, do not respond to this, I‚Äôm done.
Possibly the camera is video only and no audio?
The idea of ‚Äúgifts‚Äù may not have been interpreted that way by the native people. You‚Äôre putting your logic and reasoning on them and it doesn‚Äôt work that way. So yes, essentially they did steal. If someone comes to my house and takes my cutlery but leaves me some plastic forks and spoons, is that not stealing my cutlery? Come on now.
Idk why people act surprised/"told you so", its a protest about war in middle east, not love parade lol
I don‚Äôt fucking know. Some weird shit like this happened in Detroit earlier this year to. Not to say their isn‚Äôt religious radicalism in western societies. There absolutely is. I don‚Äôt think any bans are necessary but rather at least through legal ways, better vetting for sure who can assimilate and who cannot.
So woman thinks McDonalds had this wrapper made before Gaza got their first humanitarian aid truck?
I think, in the end, it boils down to pure antisemitism and the enemy of my enemy is my friend. Ah, and they might not be very good in the art of thinking...
That‚Äôs what the Indian expedition is saying, what looks like reasonable to us may be life and death to them, who knows. I am glad they are still left alone.
Of the reality checks someone could get, this is pretty mild!Their heart's in the right place *and* without stab wounds! That's progress!
Even that Christian guy trying to convert had been there one time prior.
Right I understand all that üòÇ I was responding to a comment that made it sound like the expedition looted the village and that‚Äôs why they weren‚Äôt welcomed back.  I was simply trying to say that was not a very accurate description.  Some bows and what not were taken, but many gifts were also left there.
It really makes you wonder why Republicans don't like groups like Hamas. They have so much in common.
Imagine walking around, with a life so good ,all you have to get upset over is a fucking chicken sandwich wrapper.
Shut. The. Fuck. Up. Go call the Golden Arches. Those poor people do not deserve to put up with that shit.
Why did she eat in a mc donald at first?!
I like how she absolutely ate her meal. But wanted to really go complain about the wrapping anyways.
The values in the Middle East are so far from Western values. How do you expect that person to integrate into Western society
Damn that's near me. Horry county is fucked up
My ex's kid had this happen while we were together. It was terrifying. They dropped him off on a main thoroughfare next to a McDonalds. He was six. A lady called the police when she saw him walking alone, that's the only reason we found him. She took him to McDonald's and got him a happy meal and a toy. We never got to thank her which I hate so much. If you're out there reading this and you helped a blond haired kid in Burien, right off the 120 city bus route, thank you so much. He wasn't home from the school bus when he should have been, but it never came by so we didn't think he was missing, just a late bus which happens sometimes. Then she texts me when I'm on the way home from work and says the school doesn't know where he is, a few minutes later the police get in touch with her, but they had to get her number from the school. It was a shitshow.&amp;#x200B;And to top it all off? When we brought this all up and asked what was going to be done about it? They tried to make us feel like it was our fault.&amp;#x200B;That didn't go very well for them, we fucking lost it at that point. I've never been so angry at a person in a professional setting like that. I was ready to kill, I mean maim, destroy. I wanted blood.&amp;#x200B;I'm shaking just thinking about. In that moment I suddenly understood in very real terms the concept of being willing to die or suffer so your child doesn't have to. I understood it intellectually before that, but after I had benediction.
Virtue signaling at its worst
They may have in their minds connected the negative outcomes (such as getting diseases) with outsiders entering their dwellings, god knows what the Indian anthropological survey party did during their stay, we only know what they want to say. Also remember ~ 100 years prior to these encounters a British explorer took 4 children from this island and he was suspected to be a pedophile. But the children were returned and since then the islanders have culturally closed off for outsiders.
No doubt I was simply pointing out it wasn‚Äôt straight up theft, per say.  And in fact, the islanders gladly accepted goods from them in subsequent trips as long as they didn‚Äôt enter the islands interior.
"It's not your fault because you're an employee"So why are you questioning him like he's corpShe treating the store like she's at McCorp
Yeah at least I think US citizens are supposed to pledge allegiance to the US and its constitution. The idea being you should support and defend the bill of rights. Basic stuff right there. You can't move to a free country unless you believe everyone deserves freedom.
‚ÄúYour honor, yes, we did loose her child. And that child was found with no assistance on our part BUT if you take a minute to look at this video you will see that the mother was using wordy durds. What was I to do?‚Äù
And both are a choice that people make.
I feel like Greece more readily than Isreal.
Omg please do NOT conflate your war against Israeli fast food wrappers with support for the Palestinian people

&gt;so why would he feel like he needs to silently stand there and record someone yellingTheir cameras may not have audio
All of their signs look professionally made by one person.
‚ÄúThat‚Äôs a Mc Chicken wrapper‚Äù was a perfect response
You've bought into Israel's propaganda. Purchasing land in a country didn't give you the right to form your own country. Only 10% of the land was purchased, the rest was stolen. They continued to build settlements in Palestinian lands over the decades, intentionally pushing for retaliation so they can claim to be justified.
That's right!! The president of our own country supports genocide, just like CNN. Seeing the white house lit up in blue &amp; white lights literally sickens me. It's like WWII with America not allowing jews to be saved. I loathe this country. Sickening. History repeats itself.
She‚Äôs wrong.  It‚Äôs in support of Greek Americans who play sports for Duke University.
Purchasing the land gave them legitimate claim to the land.  Being attacked during multiple wars and beating the aggressors gave them legitimate claim to additional land.  Many of the countries in the Middle East and almost all in Africa are artificial borders/countries created by colonial powers - including next door neighbor Jordan.
It would take a number of months to get this design created by their agency, approved by layers of management and legal, and produced in the quantities McD‚Äôs uses AND distributed to all their locations. So NO, McD‚Äôs didn‚Äôt just do this for the unplanned war.    (Marketing person here.)
Chickens for KFC!
Nailed it.
Total fucking moron
Missionary work is disrespectful and gross.
You're attempting to justify genocide. The Israels have no legitimate claim to the land. The Israeli government should be abolished and it's citizens returned to the counties they came from. Their push for ethnic cleansing is Palestinian citizens is clear.
Most of the Jews came from Europe.  Some came before the Holocaust and were removed from their homes in Palestine by the Ottoman Empire during WW1 because their previous European associations.  Most Jews from Europe came after the Holocaust to find a safe haven.  A large significant number came from other Arab countries after being kicked out of their homes and displaced. A few were already living in the area.  When you see a picture of the Jewish military, the ethnic mix is obvious from intermarriage with local populations of their previously adopted homes over hundreds of years.  Some look Russia, a few with red hair, some look Arabic.  Don‚Äôt forget, the Jews that came from Europe purchased the land from the local owners.  Jews initially accepted the two state solution proposed by the British; it was the Arabs that rejected it.  The war started by Arabs that sought to destroy Israel and the Jews turned out to expand their borders and cause the displacement of many local Palestinians.    Choosing to destroy the Jews is what has caused the misery of the local Palestinians.
Well did the sentinels asked for the trade? They actively hide themselves from intruders. May be they got diseases from this trade and many died afterwards hence them proactively resisting contact instead of hiding. Good strategy I‚Äôd say, if every native group did this from day one, we‚Äôd have a lot more of them alive today.
This is crazy. Honestly tho, there no better situation to be involved in if your plane has trouble. Just jump out with your parachute. That saved all of those lives I‚Äôm sure.

Melanin infantilization. A lovely bi-product of identity politics.
What a waste of fucking time. She posted this to her socials thinking she actually did something besides waste her time and irritate the fuck out of those underpaid workers.
I know there was no event that caused the policy change in our county but there could have been something else that happened someplace close by. I've lived here all my life and I know for a fact these policies did not exist when I was my kids age.It's kind of ironic really, our entire county only has a population of less than 30k people (82 people per sq/mi population density) and we would likely be completely fine without any of these policies but I am extremely grateful that they exist and that they are followed to the absolute T.
&gt;what a great prophet Mohammad the and greatest example for all mankindJoseph Smith, surely should be considered a contender.
Wow they seem really nice‚Ä¶
Now that‚Äôs terrifying. Glad to hear no one died.
When you have the urge to virtue signal
This encapsulates an awful lot in one action‚Ä¶
LGBT rights in Israel are considered the most developed in the Middle East...
Well, it‚Äôs not uncommon for gays to be thrown off the rooftops of Gaza.
Well it was made.
Yes because the 12.00/hr corporate phone worker should hear about this instead.
There are a lot of comments here stating that it's not possible to reconcile the support for both Palestine and LGBT rights. I think that yes, one can be in support of LGBT rights, believe the non-combatants of Palestine shouldn't be indiscriminately killed and that those same people have the right to self-determination. This is human rights (refer UDHR). Those same rights extend to the Israeli's too.Although the position is not inconsistent, it's unfortunately not very practical. I don't know of any fundamentalist/conservative religious factions such as the Sunni Muslims of Gaza (99% of the population) that are OK with people that are LGBT.Change is possible for the better but it'll be slow and ugly...
I would consider myself a big left wing person. Honestly this shit is getting exhausting. I am being a more selfish person every day, and worrying about me more. Leftist/Faux-Commies/Socialist have to realize we can‚Äôt save the world, and any idea of peaceful progressive utopia is null and naive.
Virtue signaling Karen, wants to speak to your manager about wild conspiracies now
The genocide Hamas is documented as having aspirations for? And what about the Palestinians celebrating in the street after October 7th?
Predictable.
Have you met anti-semites? They think things like Tony the Tiger on a box of Frosted Flakes is a Jewish subversion technique to make your kids care about tigers, like some queer.
is it actually a new wrapper or no? never seen it before in my life. I think blue more resonates with fish when it comes to restaurant packaging.
Bigotry of low expectations
What does it matter if one is religious or not?

My address was soooo hard to remember too- like 5247 317th street north, no words all numbers.
Jesus,  hurt her feeling.   Ffs it‚Äôs all about you lady. Everyone is out to ruin your day
Aiding Israel is considered a holy duty by the ultra right wing. The genocide of Palestine and having Israel take over all their land is a step in end times they desire so desperately.
You must have your head very far up your own ass off you think things are as simple as they hate them cause they are Jews. Israel didn't exist. European countries came in and started taking land from Palestinians, forcing them out of their homes and communicating the land in 1948 and Israel has continued staying the land from then ever since.
Delusions dispelled
Here‚Äôs the customer services number, thanks for your feedback.Next.I‚Äôm not making a big deal, she said, making a two minute video. Moron.
If you checked, you‚Äôd probably find that there‚Äôs only three degrees of separation between Mickey Dee‚Äôs food wrappers and Mossad.And only four degrees to Hamas.Not to mention only two degrees of separation between McD‚Äôs chicken nuggets and tyrannosaurus rex!This nutsy lady could well be onto something.Or on something?
When the dog was edited in u pig
These assholes probably hate gay people more that Jews.
I ~~reveal~~ remember the story a few years back where some dumb fuck decided to go convert them to Christianity. He stepped ashore, bible in hand. The natives shot an arrow into his bible. Dumb fuck assumed this was a mistake and continued forward. It was not a mistake.
I mean it‚Äôs just not the place is it. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, stand for what you believe in - but if a group is protesting war/genocide it‚Äôs pretty insensitive to just walk up and flag about what kinda stuff you want to put up your pipe lmao
&gt;there were celebrations around the world. Where? In which part of the world ?
Shame shame Horry county. Do better!
When did the cargo ship beach?
*continues to eat the sandwich that supports the killing of Palestinian kids*I can‚Äôt
aww lol. Makes me wonder how many kids pray to Santa in their times if need. I'm sure you aren't the only one who has.

Were they trying to do a trick involving another plane? Or was this just one really bad incompetent pilot?
Are you so certain now?

hell yeah I love being recorded every second I'm in public, can't wait to make accessories that facilitate it further
Shocker - majority Muslim community hate anything LGTBQ. Just because they're a "minority" doesn't mean they're on your side, idiots.
One's a political position while the other is a religious one. That said, a lot of muslims are conservative.
Because people have been conditioned to avoid any situation which may brand them as bigoted because they don‚Äôt want to lose their jobs or be socially ostracised.
I could go for a couple of filet-o-fishes right now, preferably in their original blue styrofoam cartons. The carcinogens seal in the fish flavor.
What did they expect? The two groups wouldn‚Äôt exist peacefully with each other if it weren‚Äôt for the West
I miss seeing those soft drink cups.
Over her chicken sandwich wrapper. Let's not forget that little detail.
Always make me laugh how the left have palesteine as one of their core issue of support when the palestinians would probably behead or throw most of them off a building given a chance.
Weird. Those no burger inside the wrapping. Must have polished it off before heading in to be brave.
Well, he's not wrong
People weren't meant to do half the shit we do
Y‚Äôall Queda and all that
The fillet-o-fish has had blue and white packaging for 50 years. They‚Äôre allowed to use blue and white for things.
I mean, if somebody tells you to leave them alone... Lol
This makes me unnecessarily angry. Do you not have anything better to do?
people werent meant to fly
crazy how a little accountability goes a long way. but so many people just refuse to give that, and die on their hill of petty bullshit
That‚Äôs scary AF!  Glad to hear no one died. Story of a lifetime for all those involved.
"..this is not your fault, I'm not saying it's your fault.. this wrapping is supporting the killing of kids.. so I hope you all feel good about that."
The ship ran aground in 1980
Tables have turned.It's not a demonstration march in the UK if there isn't a Socialist Workers Party placard, and a Palestinian flag. School meals protest; Palestinian flag. University tuition fees; Palestinian flag.
i never understood what the pilot was trying to do here. the whole maneuver seemed super sketchy without the gust of wind fucking them over.
By friends aunt was one of the sky divers. Everyone including pilots were completely unharmed
Everything I wanted to know in one comment, can skip the others
My child is even younger than yours so I would be even angrier than you, but I don‚Äôt think either of us would go to prison. That would be bad for our kids dude, my kid (young) needs someone to raise them. Can‚Äôt be going to prison while trying to be a parent
Just a sidenote. Thanks for the location. Beautiful scenery for a wallpaper.
Sounded like someone was forcing her out. That just makes it look worse for them.
I'm general population, belay is not a word for me. :) Thank you.
Holy fuck what a moron. Christ almighty
Yeah for sure, that‚Äôs probably why the guy is filming her
For real. The spirit!Love them tryna bring excuses too!"We're not the only ones doing such things! There's others like us!" - and that's the problem
&gt;It changed a few months ago. &gt;I don‚Äôt think so. Just doesn‚Äôt want to listen to him.
I mean what happens if they‚Äôre like ‚Äúok we‚Äôll give you a refund‚Äù BEFORE she eats her food? She won‚Äôt feel powerful enough unless she actually gets something out of it
Aww that's good to hear! Ty for filling me in.
Thankfully, everyone survived. One pilot jumped, and the other one managed to land the plane.  [https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/pilots-passengers-jump-to-safety-as-planes-collide-old-video-is-viral-again-2550544](https://www.ndtv.com/offbeat/pilots-passengers-jump-to-safety-as-planes-collide-old-video-is-viral-again-2550544)
Most countries in the middle east have disputed borders with one another. I dont see them agree to unilaterally attack isreal when they can't get their own shit together. Besides, they are pussy with the US involved.
The pilots were equipped with parachutes in this case. No one died. Scary af tho. It's like a POV cutscene from the early WW2 Call of Duty games.
‚ÄúQueers for Palestine‚Äù gives off huge ‚ÄúChickens for KFC‚Äù energy lmao.
Why don‚Äôt these people criticise Muslims when they do it but rip conservatives a new one when they do it?
Picked the wrong side fool
Yankees
Good idea try again
Judging by some of the comments here making excuses, probably the latter lmao.
It‚Äôs obviously support of Finland lady. Which is horrible.
Shit, hopefully everyone made it out alive.
Might be wrong but apparently no one died
Britain brought a lot of immigrants to Palestine in a few decades. These immigrants were less than 30 % of population but they were given over 50 % of land in 1947 to call Israel. It was Britain's way of getting the jews out of UK.
I can imagine the pilots were the ones to end up dying from this accident.. you'd be lucky to be one of the skydivers already equipped with a parachute.
I think I‚Äôll go eat at McDonald‚Äôs more now
Conservatives in the us and Muslims actually have many thing in common
Do you think (especially) Americans have the mental capacity to not get triggered by manipulative media? "Shifting opinions" deliberately is literally propaganda. It is the mastermind mechanism behind every mob mentality out there. These media are the abettors. The jihadist imams of our world
&gt;Black MotherI feel like including a racial descriptor here only serves as race-baiting. Is it relevant to the story?
No the territory now known as Palestine formed part of the Ottoman empire until it was occupied, in 1917-19, by British forces under the command of General Allenby. Promises. In 1917,¬†in order to win Jewish support for Britain's First World War effort, the British Balfour Declaration promised the establishment of a Jewish national home in Ottoman-controlled Palestine. So even in the control of ottoman empire it was called PALESTINE üáµüá∏

Hang on, I thought the LGBTQI+ and the Apocalyps Cult were allies!
Yep. Europe needs to shut the borders and enforce strict border control with Africa and the Middle East. Economic refugees, particularly those who refuse to integrate, have no place in Europe.
Ah, South Carolina...that explains a lot.
Most definitely. Their resources are scarce, so im sure they have and still continue to collect any scrap they can.
Lol it's funny that the visitors of the festival were also mostly young liberal people.
RIP London
Exactly. That dude recording her didn‚Äôt see a distraught parent, he saw an ‚Äúangry black woman‚Äù.Only when she said that her child had been missing for over an hour did he realize HE might be in the shit and put the phone down.Pathetic.
Muslims: welcome us to your country, accept our beliefs and send help to our country.Also muslims: Fuck you with your freedoms and beliefs.But help us.
Attempting to be understanding in general is huge for most people. At least then you won't feel alone in looking for a solution to whatever the issue is and you feel like you have some kind of backup
‚ÄúYou are in the protest but we do not grant you the rank of member‚Äù
Who elected whom? Most Palestinians weren't even alive back then. Hamas was planted by the US and Israel to hunt down PLO. You are having fun with the possible genocide and you keep projecting. Documented are 80 years of war crimes from Israel by the UN, the Red Cross and the Amnesty. Israel would have been dragged to Hague 100 times if the US didn't cover them up.
So they are not tolerant? Wow.
Purest example of how some ideologies Cannot exist together
Intersectionality at work.
Woke people support Palestine. Palestine be like no thanks
No gay for Muhammad!
This is satire right
There‚Äôs a hypothesis that they kill others since their immune system can‚Äôt handle our bacteria which could eliminate an entire tribe. They certainly don‚Äôt know about bacteria and shit, but hey, I just share someone‚Äôs opinion, who the fuck actually knows why they do that
The bus driver messed up and should have radio'd it in to ask if this was the appropriate stop. It may have been a "jumper" which is basically a substitute driver who doesn't normally do the route.
What is this like a trend now?
She have too much spare time
funniest part is you don't even get to see her at any point in the video except for a 0.5 s flash of the arm which doesn't show anything.
I dont mind.  This is pure comedy watch when leftist use all their mental gymnastic points for trying to tell everyone that one of the most conservative muslim communitys do sport gays.
I had something similar in kindergarten. The school decided to give buses an animal, instead of a number, so the young kids could figure out which one they were supposed to be on if they didn't know numbers yet. It was a big district so some of the numbers were triple digits so that's fair. However, instead of a colored, detailed picture with the word underneath, it was just a black silhouette of the animal. Some genius decided it was a good idea to have a "Dog" bus and a "Fox" bus. I was one of several kids that got on a wrong bus on the first day.
Don't they know what religion think about them? Islam in particular is the worst of the bunch
For sure! Imagine going someplace that clearly doesn‚Äôt want you and their military governing body doesn‚Äôt want you either. You‚Äôre gonna get arrows.Edit:There‚Äôs a doc about it out now. ‚ÄúThe Mission‚Äù
I live is SC, it is so nice when I cross the state line into NC at any point, and the roads automatically improve 100 percent.
To be honest,  if the school had done that to my daughter,  and anything happened to her, they would have to had called the police to get me off the SOB.
This lady has way too much time on her hands, it‚Äôs gross that she thinks it‚Äôs OK to harass fast food workers that have no control over what packaging is shipped to them.  This woman needs to get a life.
illusions were lost that day
I hope the QuEeRs fOr PaLeStInE see this.
people should just leave them fricking their relatives while staying in bronze age, not everything needs to be modernized it's their choice
one of the most common types of belay devices in climbing is called an ATC (https://climbinghouse.com/atc-belaying-device/), a grigri is a different type of belay device that can auto lock (https://www.petzl.com/US/en/Sport/Belay-Devices-And-Descenders/GRIGRI) which is generally seen as a safer option
People are so, so dumb.1. It's insane to go up to the cashier with this absolute bullshit2. Even if you got past step 1, as soon as the person that works there and actually looks at the packaging every day said we've had these for several months, it should have ended there3. If you got past step 2 there is something not wired right in your head, and I don't think you should be trusted with things like owning a gun or driving a car.
Could have jist gone with 'Mother' and we would have gotten the context
Ngl, was expecting the comments to heavily disagree with the palestinian supporter... I'm glad that reddit still has people with common sense and logic on it.
You‚Äôre telling the truth though.
This could escalade even more üòÄ

I mean, the LGBTQ flag wouldn't do so hot at MAGA rally either lol.
It's clearly in support of finland /s /s
Hell this flag won't do too well in Maga rally as well lol.
Good
Ugh, this is basically a nightmare scenario for me...I am absolutely spoiled by our school district and our kids bus driver and bus garage as a whole. We live in a rural area, so the bus stops right outside our house and the county policy is that no child can be released from the bus without an approved guardian there to accept them until they are in at least 5th grade. They take this policy dead ass seriously to the point that even though the bus literally stops 40 feet from our front door and the next closest house is several hundred yards away, and we're on a first name basis with the driver and buy him birthday and christmas presents, the kids are not allowed to get off the bus unless someone listed on their "bus card" is out there in sight of the driver.Twice over the years I wasn't out to the bus on time and the bus driver didn't let the kids off then called the bus garage before he pulled away and the bus garage started down the list of emergency contacts. The bus route takes them to the top of the hill then turns around and comes back by our house within 15 minutes. In that 15 minute time frame, my cell, my landline, my wife, my mom, my dad, and my sons mother all got phone calls.On top of that, all kids in pre-k and kindergarten have blaze orange labels taped around their backpack shoulder straps with their school/teacher name, a lanyard name tag with their name, school, and teacher name, and a laminated emergency contact card in their backpack with the schools phone number on it.
Because it's England? Not a Muslim country?
I wonder what would happen if Arabs do the same with an Israeli flag in Gaza. Sorry, the question is, from which floor in the building would they have been thrown from in gaza.
Imagine living such a life where these thoughts are able to permeate her consciousness and then form conclusions based on those random thoughts. She must lead either a very boring life or there's so much trauma that this is just a defense mechanism.
Seems more and more schools are contracting out these days, rather than maintaining their own fleet. Then, we read about shortages of drivers and having military reserves needing to fill in. Desperate situations from shortages then drop standards for who they hire and run into all kinds of trouble. Can definitely see the clusterfuck arising you mentioned.
you support them but they don't support you.
The first time I saw this clip, it had the Battlefield theme.
Americans don‚Äôt actually give a genuine fuck about anything they‚Äôll just use any event or controversial news topic to complain and make it about themselves.
Muslims protesting for their human rights don‚Äôt care about your human rights? Shocked to the core üò±üòÖ
I‚Äôm gonna share this and help make sure it‚Äôs everywhere. This is appalling!!!!
Gotta learn the hard way. Wtf was that person thinking?
Idk either. What did you think was gonna happen? It's obvious that assimilation is not going well
you sent me searching for some climbing stuffwhy'd you do that?

School transportation is in big big trouble. One of those already shitty things ravaged by Covid, that did not recover. No plans, no investments, no ideas.
Folks are getting absurdly ridiculous, if now changing any marketing or packaging colours to blue &amp; white OR any colours associated with conflict. Grow tfu. Oh wait, that might lessen your social media followers. ü§®
It is openly forbidden to travel to the island, and their interactions with outsiders had only ever been bad. Our knowledge of their intentions isn‚Äôt really relevant. They have very clearly conveyed that they don‚Äôt want people coming on their land, and the people that were killed blatantly disregarded that wish and tried anyway. It would be like trying to walk onto a secret military facility with tons of keep out signs and warnings, getting shot, and claiming they‚Äôre in the wrong because you had good intentions.
Idk if the anger would just *dissipate* with someone's child being neglected this way
They really think they‚Äôre on the same page don‚Äôt they?
Agreed.However‚Ä¶ why are people that don‚Äôt believe in the core values of the country allowed to move to the country permanently?There is a complete systematic issue here.
Just true colours coming out I guess.
The thing is... I think they just did.   Them or the county.  The schools are no longer associated with the buses. First week of school was a clusterfuck I hear.
yep. i thought exactly this when i saw the man recording. he just wanted something to validate his prejudices about angry black women. i hope he was embarrassed when he realized her anger was actually a relatively reasonable reaction to A MISSING CHILD.

It's like high school clicks and trying to be the popular kid. High school literally felt easier to get along with everyone than it does in the work world. I hate fake people and management everywhere seems to be full of em.
Karen‚Äôs have too much time on their hands. Call corporate. What can the franchise employees do? üòÇ if she‚Äôs so upset about it, then don‚Äôt order that, don‚Äôt eat at McDonald‚Äôs.
Why are they putting up missing posters in Miami?  I doubt anyone in Miami will find them, unless Hamas tossed the body into the Mediterranean Sea, and it got stuck on a shark or whale or something and they drag the body through the straight of Gibraltar all the way across the Atlantic and then down to Miami.  By the time they get all the way down there being dragged in the open ocean by a shark or whatever the body is going to be so decomposed that ain't no one gonna recognize them from a picture.  So why are they posting pictures of the people captured overseas in the US?  Just to video and piss people off is my guess.
A subreddit banned me when I wrote this under a photo of the Queers for Palestine: ‚ÄúGood for them. Too bad they won‚Äôt last a day before they get either jailed or killed by Hamas.‚Äù Somebody who obviously doesn‚Äôt know the reality on the ground in Gaza (or even the West Bank) accused me of making hate speech. Ludicrous.
We already have multiple people in this thread being in full denial: one is claiming we can't tell if the person taking down that flag is pro-palestinian or muslim, could be anyone. Another one is already accusing Mossad of sending one of their agent to take down that flag, to make the pure, progressive, accepting palestinians/muslims look bad.You can bet the person with the flag will tell the story to their friends, who will then tell them it's definitely an agent provocateur, that permanently proves the palestinian/hamas cause and the lgbtq cause are one and the same, that's why they must defend the hamas cause to the end.
If I had a time machine I‚Äôd go back and start a flag company.
They haven‚Äôt evolved socially in thousands of years. Even right now, they‚Äôre viciously killing each other because they follow the same religion differently.
That‚Äôs the advanced course
"I don't want to make a big deal"
A random person runs up to you screaming and recording. You have zero idea what she will actually publish. You work a simple 9 to 5. Are you sure you can't spare a quick 5 minutes of recording to cover your ass?
I read his facial expression as being "oh, no, she's not just freaking out about some small thing about how the kid was dropped off, this is a legitimate issue to deal with."
Well, he also mentions leaving all sort of gifts in return too. So it‚Äôs not like they just looted the place and bounced.  They left items that were probably worth their weight in gold the the islanders.  He mentioned metal rods for example.
They should be happy they didn't take them sight seeing to "the nearest highest point"
He didn't get the memo that for semites butt stuff is no no
I think we'll get there soon. I bet there are a ton of startups trying to make fashionable and affordable wearable cameras that constantly record to the cloud.
If you knew Indian police, he was a generous guy for just taking some trinkets.
Any screaming person comes into my office, I'm recording them.Notice that he put it away right when he realized she was there for a legitimate problem.
I can change her

This is like the Queers For Palestine movement. Absolutely brilliant.
COD (call of duty)
Lmao I also followed a dog when I was about 7. It was the fluffiest, nicest dog ever. I was just playing with chalk in my driveway and it went up to me, and her owner was nice so I tried to say "Wait for my mom I want her to see" but I don't think she heard me as she started walking away as I ran to go into the garage. Seeing her leave, I ran after them but they were much faster than me. I don't remember if they were jogging or I just kept stopping or something because they got very far away from me after some time, but I didn't stop going after them until I was very lost. I found my own way back after crying and asking Santa if he'd help me (kid logic I suppose)
Huh yeah maybe. It might have been from other debris that washed up. It's hard to say since no one goes there
I created a policy at my elementary school that bus drivers had to actually walk down the aisle and check every single seat instead of just looking under them from the front for legs hanging down. I was curled up asleep on a seat and missed my stop. They took me back and parked the bus and left me in it. Had another incident in kindergarten/daycare where they locked up the place and went home while I was in the bathroom. I imagine new policy got made on that one, too.
They were seen using metal tools and weapons after the ship crashed, so I guess they figured it out.
I find it even wilder that you can see a camera on the ceiling behind the reception desk, so why would he feel like he needs to silently stand there and record someone yelling at him rather than trying to deescalate the situation playing out in front of him?
What, did you really expect for her to go inside McD to rant at the minimum wage employees about how she over analyzed a wrapper's appearance then made-up connections that weren't there, on an empty stomach?
Seriously, screw this guy. He looks like a manager and he's just there standing stock still filming her like a Karen when she has every right to be upset. He should be doing every single thing he can to appease her, because what they did is ridiculous and could have easily gotten her killed. But no, this moron just pulls out his camera and escalates it by giving her the silent treatement.
Oh nooo ü§¶
They left "gifts" aka plastic cutlery, which doesn't sound like a good trade
Now now, it takes a full stomach to have enough energy to be this stupid and outraged
They would ask isreal you can tell they can't stand most democrats by way they look at them. Biden is the only reason we're in these wars his weak policy and week president.
That was my thought. "Funny" how he stopped right after.
Fun fact though. I went to mc Donald‚Äôs in Jerusalem and their French fries packaging was in a blue paper container instead of the standard red one they use. I was amused because I‚Äôve never seen any country have a different coloured one.
I was initially shocked at how this could happen and was appalled at the behavior of the staff‚Ä¶ then read that happened in myrtle Beach and all I could think was, ‚Äúah, that makes a lot more sense.‚Äù Lived in Myrtle for a year. Ended up leaving 4 months before my lease was up and paid rent for a place I didn‚Äôt live at during that time because I couldn‚Äôt stand another day living there. (It was cheaper to just pay the rent than it was to break the lease).
I keep seeing this comment whenever there's a post about the island but would that be true considering they have no idea how to make it? I always thought us inventing the thing was how that worked
Lol. Lmao, even.Lot of my community gleefully cheering for their own extermination lately.
It's all bull shit Palestinian made their choice with hamas they had a chance, and now look what's happening you can cry genocide all day only reason they hate isreal is cause there jews they can care less about the land its just cause they have different religion. Both sides have done wrong in the past but that's the past I don't care about cry baby my land first shit don't kill civilians and kids on purpose sick fucks.
Could be worst. They could decide to go to Gaza to show their support with that flag. Be lucky if the only thing that happened was the flag got stolen. I'm not really a betting man, but I'd put good money on much worse will happen than a stolen flag.
Why for every religious group being gay is bad? I don't get it.
Same reason she is - recorded evidence of the encounter. This is life in the 21st century. Someone comes in screaming and recording and you record back to protect yourself. These people probably have no idea at all what is going on.
WTF&gt;  A now-former school bus driver in Horry County School is facing charges after allegedly closing the door of the bus while a child‚Äôs arm was in the door and continuing to drive the bus in reverse to a previous stop, according to an arrest warrant obtained by News13./&gt; The mother alleges that Interlandi **drove for about a half-mile while her arm was hanging out.**
She really needs to go home and count her toilette paper stockpiles, thats too much time in public for today.
The problem is it isn't inclusive enough. Try including an image of Muhammad on the flag too - that should help smooth things out.
All that goddamn space. Left, right, up, down, forward, back‚Ä¶.and hit each other ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I guess I'm pretty similar.  But that can really go so far.  Like, theres a huge difference between "We delivered your Amazon package to the wrong house.  We apologize."  and "I drove drunk and smashed into your mailbox, sorry about that".  There's definitely levels to the effectiveness of admitting fault and apologizing, but it's definitely better than denial.
Isn‚Äôt the McChickens wrapper already blue writing on yellow paper?
Why do people support Israel or Palestine? They‚Äôre both committing many war crimes currently. Fuckin US propaganda is wild
Somebody needs to lose their job !!!!! They‚Äôre very lucky nothing happened to that child. Very lucky
there are other white and blue flags out there you fucking muppet..10$ says she's not even Palestinian, as she claimed.
Edit: sry i am stupid ü•∫
Imagine thinking all Palestinian supporters are progressive leftists, but regardless, it was still pretty unrelated.
The alliance is crumbling
I always think that the people in videos like this who are holding their phones up to record look *SO* dumb, but then I remember that the POV we are seeing this from is someone who is doing the *exact same thing*.If only there was a line of concealable body cameras that were easy to wear, so we could get more candid and honest reactions from people being confronted with justified grievances like this woman was doing.People behave differently once the phones come out and they know they are being recorded.
Jfc a Google search shows one of their students fell out of a moving bus! Who are they hiring?!?!?!
I‚Äôd have lost my shit too. Angry moms with little ones had no problem letting everyone know they fucked up.
Yet my mother simply refuses to.
This comment is too far down.  You're at work, some lady rolls up acting psycho, you have no idea wtf is going on or why, camera out for evidence.
Like the simple reason that people who come from different countries carry diseases that their bodies aren't immune to? Outsiders visiting these islands are likely to kill every native simply because they don't have immunities that we have built into our DNA. Intentions don't mean shit when your runny nose could wipe out the island.
Israeli crazy.
Shit, yall wanted a thrill...
Good intentions like- missionaries?
Even if she was correct the kid working the register has absolutely nothing to do with that decision.
Thus proving that they were right all along.
It never goes well for the less well-developed people in these cases.
That must have been so scary. I have a picture of myself on my first day of kindergarten with my address hand printed on a card hung on a necklace around my neck since I was riding the bus!
Leftists who think the Muslims support them as they do them  lmao
I don't want to make a big deal about this...
The original yellow wrapping supported the Savannah Bananas, but they lost their sponsorship. TIL
Soylent Green is people.
That‚Äôs quite the juxtaposition.
Lol. You equate a challenge to your flawed logic to a challenge to your dick? Insecure much?The whole point you‚Äôre willingly missing is that your ‚Äúdeduction‚Äù isn‚Äôt logical. If you choose not to read my explanation as to why, that‚Äôs just more of your willingly ignorant behavior on display. I was just trying to help you not look stupid but you seem determined and I‚Äôm all out of ideas on my end.
As if we didn‚Äôt already know. They‚Äôre trying to provoke US involvement so badly it‚Äôs almost embarrassing for them
You lost me two sentences in. I have zero interest in getting into a dick-measuring contest over a fucking logical deduction. Let alone read read that diatribe.
Want a worse one? The church camp my friends used to go to as kids got shut down. They found out years later its because the camp gave 10 girls to a place that said they were a beauty salon that wanted to do free makeovers for kids. They dropped kids off at a random address then drove away where luckily it was just a weird woman that wanted to practice and thought she was doing something good. No parents were informed.  No one was supervising.  And then the church elders argued with the furious parents.
What the fuck did he expect? That they put his flag on the top and praise him for his bravery? Those people arent really known to be progressive, but i guess someone has his worldview a bit rattled now.
The president of our PTA got certified to drive a school bus so the school could have field trips‚Ä¶they never had any extra drivers
What‚Äôs this lady got against the flag of Finland?
For real. She was looking for a heated geopolitical debate about the ramifications of apartheid with the guy at a Mickey d‚Äôs register.
That school employee was dumb to use his phone to record this‚Ä¶at least in my state on school properly in an official job function ‚Ä¶It‚Äôs no longer personal property and is available via freedom of information act and can be requested to be used in court as evidence.
Almost 70 year old driver. I don't trust a lot of people that old to drive sedans by themselves, I sure as hell don't trust them driving a bus full of children.
Not my cousin in nj. You have the designated drop off area and that's were the kid gets off. Hes 6 and walks down the road every day.
I got lost as fuck following a random dog around when I was like 7, and some lady saw me on the verge of completely losing my shit while I wandered around her neighborhood.She pulled over and said something like "I know you're not supposed to talk to strangers, but uhhh do you need help?" and I tried to play it cool but almost started crying, so she drove me to her house and called my mom, and I got really embarrassed because by sheer coincidence, her house was directly behind my friend's house, who lived down the street from me.She'd picked me up a couple blocks away, but of course everyone made it sound like I got lost behind Marty's house. No respect.
Would have been funny if the employee was the one to say that!
&gt; I get that McD's is under fire for whatever is going on in the middle east,LOL What??? What does McDonalds have to do with ANY of this? The lady's insane and McD's is not using mcChicken wrapping as subliminal messaging.
Most school transportation has bidding etc. on schedules based on seniority, and also needs a significant substitute pool just like teaching, so even with full-time work (not the norm) there's lots of part timers. They also aren't paid during the summer like teachers, so it's still quite difficult to get people to work for less than teacher wages with the same teacher drawbacks.    My mom was a bus driver for 30 years. I love kids and I've never gotten a negative mark on my driving record (my mom taught me how to drive haha), but you could not pay me enough to be a bus driver.
I saw that a certain occupation is spending millions on YouTube ads, and the top country they were spending on was France
The same reason she was.  This is where we are nowadays.  People come in recording, so the other side starts recording as well, because what else can you do?Guaranteed guy recording didn't instruct the driver to drop a child off at a different location than they were supposed to, but the driver and aide aren't there to provide rebuttals, so just record the interaction and let management deal with it later.
You absolutely can!
COD MOMENT
You misspelled cunt.
Not only that, due to stereotyping, there's always this negative stigma that once a woman (especially a black woman) raises her voice, she's out of line, way too emotional, and being disrepectful.You see plenty of it in reddit comments, hell, even this thread has a couple of blowhards calling her too emotional. In this instance, it's completely justified for her to be upset how this school handled her child.
Too late man. Sorry.
Wow, she‚Äôs really dumb.
You ate it tho üòÇ
You put your food in it to keep it from the open air and then you throw it away.
Israel started invading Palestine in 1948. Israel started everything. Ignoring the past and pretending like this started on October 7th is idiotic
Holy crap. Your parents got the scare of lifetime. Did you continue to ride the bus after that incident?
I'm filth according to you...but you are blind and deaf because you can't handle the truth...can't refute my arguments... it was Isreali Defence Minister and seconded by 99% by Isreali population who call and are treating them like animals with USA blessings
50% of the population of Gaza is children. The average age is 18. Why? Because Israel has committed genocide against the Palestinian people.  Go ahead and cover your eyes and pretend Israel has done nothing wrong. It just makes you wrong.

A library containing very important information about the ancient history of our species is way more important than one of 50 planes left which were made with ‚Äúoriginal parts‚Äù in the ‚Äúoriginal time‚Äù in which they were made, during World War Two.The only thing that makes you believe it‚Äôs valuable is the fact that I was made about 80 years ago. The library of Alexandria contained literature dating thousands of years back.There‚Äôs a MAJOR difference. We have the knowledge to make more B-17s. We don‚Äôt have the knowledge all those books contained.

Probably not the best time to be making that argument. Whether you are paid properly or not, you are a piece of trash to not look out for kids. That‚Äôs not about pay, that‚Äôs just basic humanity. If you don‚Äôt have basic humanity, no amount of pay is gonna make your half-assed effort good enough for children.

Well those people are dead. Those natives don't play, they make no exceptions they WILL and DO kill anyone who steps onto their island. Can't say as I blame them.
During the pandemic, I had something similar happen.  My neighbour has 2 sons, and one set of grandparents does the babysitting while they're at work.  Note: I have never met this family.  Still have no clue who they are.  One day, I was out with my (then) partner, and we noticed the older son running in the street.  He was only about 2/3.  I managed to catch him before he ran into the busy street, and all he could say in Mandarin was that he was looking for mom.  I speak **very basic** Mandarin.  But I was able to tell him that I would be able to help him find mom.  Scooped him up, and dropped him off to extremely chill grandparents, who only noticed he was gone while we were literally walking up their driveway.  The door was wide open.    To be safe, I ended  up calling the non emergency line and had a Mandarin speaking police officer come by to talk to the family after describing what happened.  It seemed to do something, because their grandparents kept a much closer eye on them after that.  I was so happy I managed to grab him, because he was almost hit by a car.  I would have never been able to live with myself if that had happened!
Killing each other for thousands of years? Modern Israel has been around for like 75 years and ancient Israel existed first only 98. You aren't well informed on the subject.

Serious question. Why isn't the title just "mother" Why does her race have something to do with the situation?
Israel funded hamas to destabilize Palestine. So even all that is Israels fault.
Same thing happened to me as a kid. Substitute bus driver brought me to school and recognized me after school when I was looking for my bus to daycare. She convinced me I was on her bus so I got on and went home. Played outside my house for hours. Parents found out hours later when they went to pick me up and I wasn't there.I lived 7 miles out of town with the nearest neighbor a half mile away.

Interesting. I guess that's by location. When I was a kid, we'd get off on our own. I see busses drop kids off on their own today as well.
People think jewish people and think somthing nonferrous.....its super messed up.
It's not too hard people forget hamas still have over 200 hostages and are holding americans right now. There is no reason for anyone to take them down besides hate and we get people fired over yelling at a Starbucks worker if we can find them this is no diffrent.
This is why you do a bit of research before throwing yourself to a cause. Its fine if you want to protest but that doesnt mean they will stand up for what you believe in reverse.

I was about 6 and at YMCA day camp.  They took us to a park.  They left me and another kid there.  Luckily I had a dime to call home.   It really was not a great area, that could have gone bad.  I wasn't there when my mother went to talk to them, don't think she sent me back.EDIT: Now that I think about it, I think I asked an old man if he could spare a dime.
She's nut, she's irrational, she's not thinking for even a nanosecond, but she said 'I hope you *don't* feel good about that".

The red and yellow wrapping supports China
When I was a kid (around 6 or 7) I got dropped off at the wrong stop by the bus driver. I guess she thought I was a different kid, but I was waiting by the side of a jack in the box for like an hour until my friend and her parent happened to drive by and see me just kinda standing there. The mom grabbed me and called my mom freaking out and I wasn‚Äôt even her kid. I don‚Äôt know what happened to the bus driver after that, but I know for a fact that the school had two very angry moms in that office that day lol
Something like this happen to my son. School didn‚Äôt make sure he got on his bus. So the busses left him at school and instead of calling me  they let him walk home because he said he knew the way ( he did not he was 6)  I found him behind a tree crying thinking he was going to be lost forever. I was so pissed.  This was in the 90s
I can‚Äôt believe I didn‚Äôt know this was Superior.

I wonder if whoever was waving that flag has started to reconsider their ideas, or if they‚Äôll enter into another bout of mental gymnastics to keep that fragile worldview intact.
If this happened to my oldest at that age, she would never get on a bus again. The other two would have been scared but recovered. What's the Mama to do now? I wouldn't trust them ever again with my child.
He hates these cans. Stay away from the cans.!
Networking is a huge skill and advantage in the corporate world
Drivers at my kids school district work full time, schools starting times are different per grade 7:30 for elementary, 8:30 for middle and 9:30 for high school, ending also different times and they use the same buses, drivers hours are 6-10am and 2-6pm, it sucks to have a big gap during the day but that‚Äôs 40 hours a weekNo idea about pay though

Am I supposed to care more because it says black mother?
She has already been found in this video.
She still ate the sandwich. It is an empty wrapper‚Ä¶..I wonder if the outrage improved the taste or if she was saying ‚Äúthis is disgusting‚Äù with every bite.
‚ÄúI know you‚Äôre just an employee,‚Äù and yet continues to blame him for a chicken sandwich wrapper.
They salvaged the metal from the wreckage and it sent the sentineles into the Bronze Age.
My kid just turned 6; if this happened to him he would be so terrified. I can't even imagine how someone does that to a kid.
That would be some great cinema...if it wasn't real life...
Because she's being loud and black so obviously she must be in the wrong.

That's how it was when my kids were that age. And now that school is back in session, all the buses for that age group, will not let a kid off the bus until someone is collecting them. I'm behind these buses every morning and afternoon and no kid that age is getting off a bus left alone on the side of the street.
It was completely forbidden when he tried too.

It's funny that the package is empty. Which means she ate it, then was outraged.
You're only paid a certain time every day. If your route is expected to take 1 hour in the morning and one hour in the evening, then you'll get paid 2 hours per day. So the high $/hr really doesn't mean anything at the end of the week. If times have changed since I was driving school buses 8 years ago then that's great, but I only got about 4 hours a day for my route and it was $15/hr

FUCK the prick filming her! I would not have been so calm.....she is a bad ass mom, and  support her 100%. Heads need to roll. Glad the outcome was safe! Color of mom has no place in description, all good mothers are the same, even mediocre moms would have been pissed. Calling out her skin color was unnecessary and irrelevant.
Exactly. Not the best idea.
I‚Äôve said it before. I‚Äôll see it here: the vast majority of people learned about this conflict five minutes ago from bullshit videos they found on Facebook.

So glad you were able to repay this. I‚Äôm really sorry it happened to you. I would have razed the transportation department.
I thought for elementary kids, an adult had to be visibly waiting before they'd let them off the bus. That's what our school district has always done, but maybe it's not a universal rule.
when someone admits their error to me any anger completely dissipates and i just forgive them immediately

This happened to me my first day of kindergarten. It was really foggy, and I told my bus driver that it didn't look like my stop but he said it was and it just looked funny because it was foggy. Sure enough, it was nowhere near my house, and I have no idea where I was. I was wondering around crying, it was so foggy you couldn't see far. Eventually some man came and brought me into his house, which obviously could've been disastrous, but he was really nice and gave me some water and called the police and my mom. My mom was so freaking mad there was scorched earth. She didn't want to freak me out and drive me every day so she just drove behind the school bus to make sure that I got there and back safe. After that they started making all the kids wear a necklace that had their address on it.I repayed that kindness after finding two toddlers when I was older, and getting them to safety.
‚ÄúIt was like that since a few months ago‚Ä¶‚Äù‚ÄúNo. I don‚Äôt think so.‚ÄùSis eats too many mcchickens and thinks her opinion matters

They've committed numerous atrocities, but the targeted killing of journalists isn't one of them. Moreover, tit-for-tat atrocities still doesn't make the killing of journalists acceptable. It is amazing that I still have to explain this to people in 2023. Where is people's sense of morality?
There‚Äôs no way this is real. I refuse to believe this is real.
The optics are horrible. How about you try to calm the mother down and address her issue with compassion and understanding instead of recording? Like, you know, a professional.

I mean I don't like McDonald's because I don't like them donating crap to IDF or their political contributions or factory farming or underpaid employees or rainbow capitalism or....So instead of taking it out on random cashier's I just... don't buy their food? Seems crazy I know.
That's still not enough.
Dunno why, but my first thought was Filet-O-Fish when I saw the wrapper. Was that a thing in the 90s?
Ready?  I think we can all agree that this all started because of a false flag Op run by the head clown.  Ronald McDonald is a twisted bastard trying to bring about the end of the world.  None of us will be safe until he's behind bars.  /S

The thing is when you're black it is easier to discount your right to be angry. My kids were called the n word on a school bus, instead of taking care of the problem they did everything to cover it up including putting a portable radio over the bus pa to drown out what kids were saying.Edit: Every month is a struggle to fund the home-schooling program however having my kids in an environment where abuse, racism and gaslighting is encouraged is not something I want them to go through. I really can't afford 70 dollars a month, but no child should go through school being marginalized because of their race. It happened to me, and I don't want it to happen to them. 3 kids in home schooling are by no means affordable in ever since of the word. I'm running out of belongings to sell to support the home-schooling program, but I owe it to them. They helped me become a better version of myself and I can never repay that.I know I am not the greatest teacher, and I don't know how much longer I can pay for it, but I try to do good by them. If anyone is considering homeschooling to give your children a safe healthy environment to grow, then do it and if you can't then my empathy is with you. No parent should have to go through what my family has endured.

Almost guaranteed they will consider/have considered using "respect is a two way street" as a way of negating any responsibility."If she came in and discussed it politely, we could have handled the matter in a way that pleases all parties. But now it's gone beyond that and we had no control over that."
I probably would have done worse. Her reaction was very restrained and she should be applauded for it.
That‚Äôs our district policy! 5th grade and up are allowed to be dropped off without a guardian taking over.Any younger and they go back to the school.
"She was missing for over an hour!"Inner thoughts of Mr. Man: "Oh shit. This video isn't going to help us one bit..." \*stops recording\*
It‚Äôs a part time job. It should still pay more to attract more qualified candidates.
What a loser
If a parent comes in screaming because you lost their kid and your instinct is to record her rather than work on finding the child then you have no business being anywhere near children.
It‚Äôs crazy logic. It‚Äôs weird, sometimes owning your mistakes and admitting that you fucked up goes a long way for people. Physicians are significantly less likely to be sued for malpractice if they admit to a medical error and apologize to the patient/their family than if they don‚Äôt.

Reddit likes to circlejerk Palestine and act like Israel is an evil imperialist state committing genocide.The Palestinian people deserve human rights and statehood, but they are ruled by Hamas, who slaughtered 1400 Israelis in an unprovoked attack, and Hamas needs to be destroyed. It's unfortunate, but civilians are going to be hurt in the process. Hamas aren't going to pick up their things and leave because they ask nicely.

I'd be absolutely livid if I were this mom. She needs to talk to a lawyer.
Because the reality is that some in America still think of African Americans/ Black's as less than human.  They expect people to be less outraged when something bad happens to someone of color. And more outraged when someone of color is on the offending end.

Ripping down posters of currently kidnapped civilians is not the hill to die on.
What?Do you understand what I wrote?I wore that this is the result of years of colonialism &amp; imperialism. I wrote that this happened because Israel gives millions upon millions yearly to Hamas in order to pacify them, &amp; that once they didn‚Äôt get something else they wanted, they slaughtered Jews, &amp; now Palestinians are getting killed, and Palestine is being leveled, as a result. I wrote that factually &amp; historically none of this happened in a vacuum. AND I also wrote that the response to this is largely on Hamas, and the choices others made to pacify them, rather than to get rid of them previously. How is that supporting terrorism?
I wonder if she thinks blue sky and white clouds are also in support of Israel.
Poor guy was super polite and reasonable listening to her insane bullshit. I get that McD's is under fire for whatever is going on in the middle east, but you have to be insane to think that McD's just had this packaging ready to go in case of conflict, let alone asking the local manager about world events.
Which part?
And then the Israel government propped up HAMAS for years so they could prevent Palestine from establishing a state. But now that they are attacking Israel, we are hearing all about it. When they were attacking Palestinians, it was all good. Good ol‚Äô America being complicit in genocide.
I believe the plane with the camera aboard survived. The other plan appears to have lost a wing.
Well, you‚Äôre pointing it out from an obvious position of ignorance. I‚Äôve been jumping professionally for 13 years and have worked at a number of dropzones and flown with numerous different pilots. Not once have I ever seen a jump pilot fly with a helmet. In fact, I think you‚Äôd be hard pressed to find any videos of civilian jump pilots flying with helmets. Being able to clearly communicate with the pilot verbally is an absolute necessity for safe operations. Also, federal law requires all occupants of aircraft with doors being operated in flight to wear at least one more parachute than they intend on using during the flight. Every jump pilot is aware of the potential for skydivers to ruin the airplane. In the US, the FAA conducts random ramp-checks of aircraft and occupants. Any violations will come down on the pilot and their certificate, potentially ending their career. So, in conclusion: you‚Äôre dumb.
Yeah the minimum wage employee is making marketing decisions let's yell at him.

I 100% appreciate your stance and willingness to say it. I studied this conflict for weeks in a political science class in college, and my entire class came out of it basically saying "eeish...way, way too complicated." We could come up with no logical way of solving it. Now that the situation has exploded again, I've very carefully avoided trying to make any assumptions or form hard and fast opinions at any point, because inevitably I'm going to be missing something. It's a massive Gordian knot that too many have tried to solve with swords.
so that plane crashed ?
In general SC is a clusterfuck.
OP knows Iran isn't an Arab country unlike your uneducated ass
And what if China is there backing the Arabs?
All media is financed by blackrock, vanguard and slate street. You have controlled opposition, not necessarily accurate political viewpoints. Also, being anti-hamas doesn't make you "right-wing" the same way being anti-genocide doesn't make you "left wing".
To prove that they are not taking it seriously, I assume. Horry county is 2 different places. Myrtle beach and then the rest of the county where people actually live and raise their families.
My favorite part was the comments above saying ‚ÄúMiami Cubans are self hating Latinos‚Äù. I love when people act smug and superior like they know what‚Äôs best for an entire group of people.
SC schools are badly underfunded, mainly becauseof tax act 388, and there is a huge bus driver shortage. Because of that, they will take anyone willing to drive a bus regardless of their competency to deal with children. This mother has every right to be enraged. The low country is full of creeks, ponds and rivers.
Only the stupid states will go to war against Israel again. they tried several times and always failed. The countries controlled by Russia and Iran may try, Egypt will defend its Sinai from palistine. Accordingly, the risk of an attack only comes from terrorist states.
People interfering with them..kidnapping themSome old people and children were taken away..The adults died &amp; they brought the children backThink of the horror stories &amp; germs they brought back
Let's not deflect by pointing at the other side and saying how bad they are. The Russians did some horrible things during the war again Germany too. Didn't excuse the behaviours of the Nazis. Israel needs to wake up to its self. If it wants the moral high ground it needs to change its behaviours.
Its propaganda
Obviously. I‚Äôm simply pointing out if he lacks one safety device every other occupant has, he likely lacks the other too.
Why is he recording??? To prove the school's incompetence???
You must be fucking brain damaged if you think Hamas, a fucking terror group funded by IRGC and Qatari oil sheiks will bring "rights and sovereignty" to Gaza. You're the dangerously stupid type of person that can't be trusted with a tool like the internet. You need to read at least a couple books before you can go around writing all these shitty opinions for all the world too see.
Yup, ive seen these posters all over where I work and live in London - by the end of the day they've all been torn down / removed
I don‚Äôt like what she is doing and I don‚Äôt like seeing her being harassed either. Let‚Äôs not sink to this.
Someone needs to be charged with neglect and child endangerment. A 5 year old dropped off at the wrong spot &amp; missing for an hours. Holy crap, this is very bad. That douchebag filming her needs to be fired for his inhumanity &amp; unprofessionalism. I hope Mama goes to the police station and files charges.
The antisemitism is stemming from the treatment of Arabs from that nation. It's similar to south Africans back with the apartheid, no one but white south Africans were to blame for the wave of international hate that came their way. The longer Israelis support their government the more international hate they are going to garnish
Are they Israeli forces infiltrating Gaza and kidnapping children and women after raping and decapitating a few thousand Palestinians?If so, please feel free to put posters up for the kidnapped Palestinians in Israel territory
Regardless of her tone, when you LOSE a five year old you also lose the privilege of hiding behind your phone and trying to handle things professionally. Professional would‚Äôve been dropping the child off correctly.
Several arab nations including Russia reported they knew who did the bombing 20 MINUNTES after it happened, which is impossible, and people have taking certainty from a social media persona as a country's official word. So misinformation has been everywhere or seems like it.People need to be careful about treating the world as black and white and lumping millions of people together. Acknowledge how complex the problems are that they lasted so long and quit using the Palestine citizens as political pieces for whatever geopolitical, internal intrigue they're pushing.
I‚Äôve heard many skydiving pilots tend not to radio their intentions of taking off, landing, etc which can lead to this. It‚Äôs not *required*, but it‚Äôs highly unsafe to do so.

What if we bail?
He lived because he still had both shoes on
Looks fun as hell
Maybe a new piece of information for you then; after the ship wreck the islanders were observed using metal tools from what they salvaged and forged from the wreck.
Why is the satellite view so shite? It's not like the native's arrows go that far!
I hope  the cargo ship was filled with rubber chickens and clown shoes.
Normally, I agree, but airshow flying is a completely different ballgame. *YES*, pilot needs to keep head on a swivel, but ATC also needs to be on the ball with their handling of the waivered airspace. *Very* tight tolerances within an airshow act, and one slight deviation or change (as ATC ordered just before this tragic collision) can lead to a sad outcome.
CNN is and will forever have a sensation bias. They won't stop talking about a story and beating it over the head like it's their golden goose. There are people that do good reporting but they get eclipsed by the heads behind making them cover Trump or left vs right 24 hours, seven days a week. A whole channel and maybe one or two stories gets covered a week.
You don‚Äôt need a helmet to skydive bud
It‚Äôs the terrorist scum Hamas,they need to be wiped off the planet
Anyone committing war crimes against innocent civilians should be wiped out.
Who cares ?
They‚Äôre not missing posters as we have come to know them, but they are ‚Äúposters of missing people‚Äù. The intention isn‚Äôt to find the people but to raise awareness of what‚Äôs going on in Israel (like the whole world doesn‚Äôt know). Propaganda is a strong term when they were taken indiscriminately. It‚Äôs all politically charged, but it any other case, no one would be batting an eyelid about these posters.

You really think that being educated equals being stupid?
100% correct. One of the big reasons I‚Äôm even in the position I‚Äôm in at work is because I know how to talk to people and make them feel good about themselves. Usually at the expense of them not knowing a single thing about me, or caring to
Oh and my job you asked.....I'm a news reporter, sometimes on the side I deliver pizzas to my friends
Can we please STOP reposting this!!!!
Lol good luck taking on a modern and well trained military like the IDF with a couple US carrier groups behind them. The Arab militants and their camels would be mowed down in days.
Probably helps that European citizens don't have guns often either. Chances of a European cop having a gun drawn on him is comparably low, and that affects everything from training to attitude American cops and people both draw guns too readily, and it's a vicious cycle.
Old, but a classic.  There will never be another video similar to this.  Everyone got on the ground safe including the pilot.
I‚Äôm 43, it‚Äôs not much better 10 years later either. People are morons‚Ä¶like this idiot lady in the video. Couldn‚Äôt even express what she believes but acts like she knows better.

Huh... you still aren't grasping that it was Hamas that killed those people. It's ok though... try reading different articles and watch the news. May be too hard for you to comprehend tho. The fact you think there is no propaganda coming from the Palestinian side is quite hilarious
Oh okay so killing 150 children is fine. Least it‚Äôs not 500. Fuck you.Let the world see what a piece of shit israelis are.https://preview.redd.it/mzt69u006mvb1.jpeg?width=684&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=bf4aa714135eb678c405da801201554a0ea717ae
"No propaganda coming from the Palestinian side"... yeah, ur full of shit. You probably also believe Israel killed 500+ people at the hospital when most of the intelligence agencies across the world are saying they didn't.
There‚Äôs no propaganda coming from the Palestinian side. You‚Äôre just falling for western propaganda which makes you think there is. But go off
one pilot landed his plane and the other bailed out with a chute. nobody died.

This is the wreck of the MV Primrose, which ran around in 1980.The crew and salvagers recorded friendly interactions with the natives.A number of Indian "contact" missions in the 1990s resulted in the natives becoming extremely hostile, the Pandit expedition is now heavily censored by the Indian government and access to its photographs and records is restricted.Makes one [wonder what Pandit actually did](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/surprised-the-sentinelese-killed-someone-first-anthropologist-to-enter-north-sentinel-island/articleshow/66787948.cms).

How recent is this?
Do it. A single one of those American air craft carriers could topple all of your theocracies.
Pilot doesn‚Äôt have a helmet on so I doubt he has a parachute.
Hamas returns all hostages safe &amp; sound, &amp; turn themselves in? This stops. Not gonna happen, however, people do need to be reminded of this constantly. I‚Äôm 100% against the treatment Israel has subjected upon  innocent Palestinian for decades, ABSOLUTELY without ANY question. That truth stated, this is happening because a group of terrorists didn‚Äôt get what they wanted, behind the scenes, so they decided to do this as retaliation. When government leaders claim that they don‚Äôt negotiate with terrorists? They‚Äôre full of total sh*t, as they negotiate with terrorists more so than they do not. Negotiations with terrorists is why this is happening, albeit failed negotiations with terrorists. This is squarely on the shoulders of those ‚Äúdemocracies‚Äù, who negotiate with terrorists like Hamas BTS. Want this to NEVER happen again? Get your shit together or it cannot be helped. Neutralize terrorism and those who perpetuate it, or it will happen again. I‚Äôm not a war hawk. Far from it. Yet even I, who didn‚Äôt graduate from Yale or Harvard, cannot be surprised that this is taking place. This ALL has to do with MONEY. Billions. Someone wanted more, didn‚Äôt get it, &amp; now here we are. I somewhat understand back room diplomacy, however, you cannot negotiate with people who don‚Äôt trust you, nor who you don‚Äôt trust, as well. It evolves into a never ending cycle, trapped within a void that has zero limits or boundaries. This might resolve soon enough, however, this cycle will never end, because this is dirty shit hidden from the world, and is NOT meant for us to see, until carnage ensues. What we‚Äôre witnessing now? Is the aftermath of a failure to communicate, &amp; strike a dirty deal. # TRUTH.
Yes it is. Maybe you‚Äôre confusing Syria to be the sea since it‚Äôs blue.
All material problems in this world ultimately break down to spiritual matters after all. This perspective is precisely for those who feel left behind, it is to invigorate them as individuals to experience the strength and security of following Gods desires. It releases them for the supremely satisfying higher service of being kingdom builders. It allows their will and transcendent spirit to be the determining factor in their experience over the material. No it does not make problems disappear, but it absorbs all issues and transcends them.The world has never seriously tried out the divine ideal of the historical Jesus' doctrine of the kingdom of heaven.
Neither is right in this situation. But to sit here and claim Palestinian innocence is very much propaganda in itself. Here‚Äôs a wiki if you‚Äôd like to do some more research. I‚Äôm sure it could benefit you. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_political_violence#:~:text=Palestinian%20rocket%20and%20mortar%20attacks,and%20disruption%20of%20daily%20life
Only problem with this scenario, Egypt has outlawed Hamas and Saudi Arabia doesn‚Äôt support them as well. Also Iraq is still reliant on US support and can‚Äôt afford to get involved
In france we had youtube ads from Israel's government justifying the bombing
Hamas started it. Therefore, they have full ownership of the situation. By their cowardly actions, they inflicted on israel, they have brought death and destruction to gazas doorstep. What was done in israel was some of the most barbaric actions visited on mankind in a generation, so don't expect to be handled with kid gloves.  The ugliness of war was brought to you by the people you selected to lead. I believe mercy will be hard to come by .
I have to know the story and if the pilots had parachutes and jumped.  Scary
Ugh. Just because people are concerned over one thing doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt concerned over the other more obvious issue. People like you are *insufferable* because you are so ignorant to how other people think, feel, and process emotion that you assume we all only have the same emotional bandwidth as yourself. It can be a huge loss for the aviation community ***and*** a terribly tragedy with several lives lost. Nobody was even remotely considering it a tragedy pissing contest and it must be exhausting navigating the world whilst trying to turn it into one.
I have read it. Just like the propaganda you spout, you choose to obtuse the facts and history of Palestine.
They could,  but they absolutely will not. Intact most of them are more likely to back Isreal than Palestine if Saudi Arabia rows in behind Isreal.
I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôs dwarfed by this list, but have there been any members of the press killed by Hamas?
Blame is wholly on hamas and its supporters. You started something that you can not finish . So off to hide behind women and children.  Moving hole to hole . Hiding in tunnels like cowardly rats while their leader lives it up safe in Qatar.  Pushing crap propaganda.
She‚Äôs on a couch with floral patterns and her pants are intact.

Someone hung these up by the local Smart &amp; Final in my neighborhood, and a lady started recording and questioning my wife when she took some pictures of the posters. Ironically, my wife is pretty sympathetic towards Israel but she was pretty eeked out when the lady took pics of our license plate when she asked to not be recorded. Everyone‚Äôs looking for a content opportunity.![gif](giphy|11VBHqO3QI7qQU|downsized)
At the same time, why are people so inclined to actually go and tear stuff like this down? All it does is give the other side videos to post all over social media. Especially with posters of literally kidnapped people, that‚Äôs losing PR every day of the week. I guarantee you that if this chick didn‚Äôt go around ripping these things down, zero people would be talking about these specific posters. People wouldn‚Äôt even know they are up. I remember seeing pro-Trump stickers and signs posted all over the place during the elections. I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôll see much more of it next year too. I‚Äôve never once felt the need to go and take any of it down even though I hate that dude. There‚Äôs nothing to gain from it.
They get the same coverage. It's just cheered on.My workplace streams the news all day in all the lunch rooms. After the attack on Israel it was basically a constant stream of video of Israel blowing up apartment buildings in Gaza for almost a whole week.
any time you find yourselfdestroying something someone else spent time on you better be damn sure it‚Äôs the right thing to do.  She could have made her own posters of Palestinians being killed.  As in, create not destroy.
What alternate universe does this moron live in. Absolutely delusional.
It‚Äôs kind of crazy how fast people are willing to shit on entire group of people just because there‚Äôs things they disagree with them on. No wonder the Israel-Palestine conflict is hopeless. The guy you‚Äôre responding to basically just said ‚ÄúFuck all Miami Cubans‚Äù simply because someone insinuated that Miami Cubans might support Israel. Like WTF lol
If Israel is backed by the US, probably not
Terrible and dumb people in high paying jobs and/or positions of power.
Well I mean the last two times that they tried Israel just ended up getting bigger so I guess if they don't mind Israel growing even more they could definitely try.
All over downtown LA too
It‚Äôs literally history. You have the option to read it for yourself too. I‚Äôm sorry that the truth hurts your feelings. But I would never parrot Israeli or Palestinian propaganda.
America, fuck Yeah!
Ya, it sucks a lot of us that support isreal. Don't want any kids to die  most innocent things in the world they only know love isreal ain't aiming at kids there using smart bombs that don't see those kids it's sucks but remember hamas target kids on purpose and let's say the 40 kid thing was fake they still killed kids on purpose by shooting them that's sick cause they killed them with there own hands little babys.
They are usually good at making friends with right people.
Ok I'm with you,  that both sides are suffering, but people here say that palastinans are faking children's death is something else and those 40 kids are a real thing even though it is reported to be fake from the same source that said that. I'm just against collateral punishment and dehumanization of innocent people .Pray for peace ‚úåÔ∏è
I believe that‚Äôs his relative on the poster he took it upon himself to do that a Palestinian person could do the same if they felt like it
Iran, the zealots running Iran, and weapons manufacturers.
I needed this.
It doesn‚Äôt matter to them, if its anything that sounds like it. They are dead set against it.Clinton instituting wet foot/dry foot policy, obama going to meet raul Castro all reinforced that thought. If you want the cuban vote you have to tell them that the only good communist is a dead one. Radio mambi was fined 3 years ago by running a scandalous George Soros ‚Äúinvestigation‚Äù.
Dumb shit.  Palestine was a creation of Great Britain.Go back to high school and pas your history course.
Yeah, but you kinda deserved it.
How about this.Isrealis wants to exist.Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas do not want Israel to exist.Iran, Hamas use the Palestinians in Gaza and Hezbollah use the civilians from Lebanon as hostages to hide their plans and their fighters who wish to destroy Israel.Isrealis walled in Gaza to try and control the freedom fighters from Hamas.Every time Hamas or Hezbollah attack Isreal, Isreal responds and civilians die.Then the world wrings it's hand about the deaths of Palestinians or citizens of Lebanon at the hands of Israel.Then, another event distracts the world and the cycle continues.Is that simple enough?
What propaganda? My fucking person, if you don't see the propaganda coming from both sides, you are fucking deaf and blind. Quite baffling really if you don't see it coming from both sides
HAMAS MUST FREE ALL HOSTAGES
&gt; There are no warrants and Isreal have arrested and imprisoned almost 5000 people in the last couple of weeks.You mean people who violated curfews or participated in riots? Also, where are you getting this 5000 figure from?&gt; You're defending people who blow up schools and hospitals indiscriminately.That's PIJ and Hamas, dude. They launched a rocket that hit a hospital in Israel. PIJ launched a failed rocket that hit a Palestinian hospital. That is LITERALLY the definition of "blowing up hospitals indiscriminately". Israel has valid legally defendable targets at those locations, and when patience runs out those targets will be hit. [See how they hide rockets under homes?](https://redd.it/177wbmb) What makes you think hospitals and churches and schools are any different?Check it out, even [Hezbollah uses schools as rocket launch sites](https://redd.it/172r77q).Hamas and Hezbollah turn those locations into a military target. Having a school there doesn't make it immune from retaliation. International law is clear on this.
Me 4th
Where can I find this??
Thank you! This was very well explained and help me have a better grasp. There are so many moving parts.
Some other commenters have explained it better, but basically Neturei Karta despises the current Israeli state. They're really not on board with the Zionist vision of a secular ethnostate. As they see it, the Jewish people are to remain in exile until God ushers in the Messiah and rebuilds the temple on the site that's currently the Temple Mount/al-Aqsa. There's no shortcuts to this: Until God deems the Jewish people worthy of liberation, any attempt to establish a state is a rebellion against God. Their "support" for the Palestinians is just them flipping off the government. You'll never see them meet with supporters of a 2 state solution or moderates on either side, for example. In the past they've met with PIJ militants or prominent Iranian leaders who would rather see the state of Israel annihilated than Israel and Palestine making peace. Anecdotally, from how these people talk about Palestinians and non-Jewish citizens of Israel in general, they could not care less about the human rights of Palestinians. Look up the "Three Oaths" if you want more specifics on their worldview.
My father flew for 28 years, mostly a Learjet 35A, but that being said no matter what a tax tells you, a good pilot should be aware of your surroundings, no matter what. This is no different than you relying on your cars GPS and driving into a ditch and then blaming the GPS for telling you to do so.
&gt;Because it goes through legal channels to approve these arrests through warrants, and those can be presented at relevant international courts should it be subpoenaed. This at worst results in a person going to prison, or at best that person being released soon after the arrest.You live in a fantasy world. There are no warrants and Isreal have arrested and imprisoned almost 5000 people in the last couple of weeks.&gt;When has Israel ever done anything like that?You're defending people who blow up schools and hospitals indiscriminately. Executed thousands of men, woman and children in the last 10 years alone. Evicted and displaced thousands more and shoveled them into gaza and the west bank. That last technique they picked up from the Nazis when they put Jews in the Ghettos in Poland
Not lieing why should i lie, and I feel like you're heartless. Both sides are suffering, and you only care about one side. I care about both if it's kids, so don't think I don't care it's just that hamas caused all of this

You're right but getting downvoted. Stupid, emotionally charged comments like that is why no one takes them seriously outside reddit.
Because many people are taught this belief from an early age and it's reinforced by most of society.  People will always want some type of caste system in their society.  We have two caste systems in the USA: education and wealth.

&gt; she would also be responsible for the stabbing of young boy in AmericaNo. Just no. Responsible for shifting opinions, yes. In the same way that parroting Hamas propaganda does. It in no way rationally leads to an American killing a Palestinian-American boy on American soil. The man that killed that child is an absolute monster that was waiting to express his hatred. An incorrect detail in a murder does not logically lead to another murder in an unrelated part of the world. No reasonable person would expect that because no reasonable person would act that way.

He‚Äôs right. CNN has become poison, and they‚Äôre supporting Israel killing off citizens who don‚Äôt stand by what Hamas did. And we all thought Fox was the biggest tumor news of all. Well done, America‚Ä¶ Well frickin‚Äô done.
Didn't they try this before?Didn't end well for the Arab countries üòÇ

Why take them down?
The holocaust was on a different level of inhumane mass torture of a group of people that‚Äôs not really comparable to any other genocide other than maybe (and this is a stretch) the Cambodian genocide. Anyways, the holocaust was a result of a century constant antisemitism for what reason exactly?
Yeah like that‚Äôs hard lol
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying. Calling CNN ‚Äúleftist‚Äù compared to other American parties is insulting to leftists lol
Bro came straight from the roblox chat üíÄ
People at that age have such strong convictions but often lack any real life experience outside their small, young, naive perspective. Aka a large child.
Happy cake day
Yes I agree and why I think they're wrong but they're worried about the slippery slope. If that type of thing happen to you and you left for another country you might not be so understanding, just saying I get it.
As they said in my University "Lo doctor no te quita lo pendejo" which roughly translates to "Having a PhD doesn't take away the pendejo". And that comes to mind everytime someone acts like her with their degrees
I gotta write a cover letter with your last sentence. Because I didn't stick it out and I didn't have the means but I have 15 years of experience yet no one wants to give me a managerial position cuz I don't have a degree. I'm back in college because I have the means now but it sucks cuz I don't want to keep paying out of pocket and stocking it out. I'd rather stick it out with a job that does tuition reimbursement.
Thanks Dr. Assumption ü§°
Right wing compared to the rest of Europe.
So my friend worked at that place in Dallas. These are both WW2 planes that were part of the "commemorative airforce" which keeps historic planes flying. Both planes were completely destroyed in the crash. Because ww2 planes have no modern warning systems or blackboxes, we don't know why it happened. My friend said a stroke in the pilot of the small plane is most likely, due to his age, but investigations assume it was a mistake. No autopsy could be performed
Yeah, the bias in this sub is daunting
I saw these posters in Downtown Dallas as well. They also seemed to have been ripped down as of Friday.
Nothing in the US is remotely far left though. Democratic Party is basically right of center compared to rest of the world. And republicans are far far right
Yes I agree, I also used to think that the folks who made it high up the corporate ladder were the smartest and wow was I wrong lol.
Stop lying you stupid heartless mf
Customer: can you deliver it upstairs?Driver: say less
You can't even call this a war. It's downright genocide. Israel wants to wipe them off the map. It's sick !!
Hamas beheads babies supported by Palistine and paid for by Russia and Iran!
US politics is all right winged tho.
Imagine how much of a filthy fucking goblin one must be to tear down a poster of an innocent missing person.
They could, but then they would cease to exist.
CNN is shit ! Fake news !
Israel invokes the holocaust every 30 seconds for the past 80 years. It's getting old. Why don't we talk about all the other genocides 24/7 like that? I'll tell you why it's, bc of the strategic value of Israel to the USA's world order.
I have Cuban in-laws from Florida and it makes sense. I don't agree with them at all and think they're wrong. But I get why they're conservative. A lot of these people had small businesses that were taken by Fidel and left with nothing. Priests were being shot in the streets and all the guns were taken away so they couldn't defend themselves, it makes sense why they would rebel against far left policies.
No one's stopping you or anyone else from putting those up. I say, go for it.
Because it goes through legal channels to approve these arrests through warrants, and those can be presented at relevant international courts should it be subpoenaed. This at worst results in a person going to prison, or at best that person being released soon after the arrest.So now are you going to address the part about bed-to-bed executions performed by Hamas or are you gonna gloss over that part? When has Israel ever done anything like that?
Absolutely absurd that you're getting down voted. Idk how tf people aren't more outraged at Hamas. Obv IDF aren't saints either. But holy shit you'd think chucking grenades in a room full of unarmed 20 yr olds or torturing a family and their two small kids for fun before executing them simply because they were jews maybe might earn the jweish people some fucking sympathy
Lol I don‚Äôt know what that even means. Leftism isn‚Äôt liberalism. CNN May be left for US politics sadly, but they are pretty middle of the road politics wise
Some of the news media are definetly complicit in the killing of innocent people and children, let's not sugarcoat their crimes as well. They were supposed to provide the public with unbiased legitimate, verfied information. News media uphold as one of the pillars of democracy, if they fall, so will be democracy.
How is a foreign government coming into your home and taking you from it not abduction?
You got an extensive list of the horrors Hamas has done too right?
No, every time Isreal gets criticized for human rights abuse their comeback is "anti sematism" and the west backs down because of the Holocaust guilt. That is why the government gets away with Apartheid tactics. Saying that, OP statement "Isreal terrorist" is a one dimensional statement that is basically a troll attempt to paint the conflict as back &amp; white. The "you are either for us or you are against us" argument is a deflection tactic used by extremists on both side and I for one do not perscribe to that, both parties are to blame, civilians on both sides suffer.
Not every educated person deserves this moniker, but I call those fools educated idiots.
The truth is few ppl here know what they are talking about. Leave Reddit now and pick up a few news papers from each side.
Propaganda, plain and simple. It's to humanise one side while completely ignoring the humanity of the other. This also creates raw meat for the right wing media to feast on when people are recorded removing the signs. There are plenty of similar videos floating around, a few have been debunked as the person ripping them down are proven to be working with the same people putting them up in order to create outrage porn.
My Man
the reason these chairs are empty is because hamas killed all of them
Ethiopian jews are white?
I fucking seen evidence you peace of shit hope they bomb the fuck out of Gaza sick fuck find a bridge jump head first
He‚Äôs right
She should make posters for the Palestinians.
Ok sure he did
I support these posters being up and would fully welcome and support a proportionate amount of additional posters of Palestinian victims. Ripping down posters of innocent victims is wrong.
Thank you for asking this question as it helps us all step back to think for a moment. Hamas states they don‚Äôt recognize the state of Israel and I think it is fair to say they would love if Israel just disappeared. I think most people would agree with what I just said. My question - what does Israel think of Palestine ? Is it the same or different?
Human? We do all the time.
I don‚Äôt even have a shred of doubt.
&gt;CNN leftistYou must be simping to some far far far extreme right-handed shit to think CNN is anything close to left. Sure it's left of how far out right you are. I'm sure you think a lemonade stand is socialism if you think CNN is leftist. LOL
Facts the more I know the less I know
It means the opposite now a days. Just means you were a good memorization robot.
Those that support Hamas are as guilty as Hamas, they picked their team. You have to kill the machine that feeds the future generations if they won‚Äôt self police the hate within. Hamas initiated the final attack with their actions, now they realize Israel accepted the invitation for the final showdown and are regretting calling them out. The classic fucked around and found out bully realizing the kid who took his shit for awhile is now about to kick his ass, badly..
I approve. We went back to MSNBC because of this.
"Comes back with a Nazi flag"
If the shoe fits
Ahh not a bother. I was having a bit of a day, so apologies for the tone.It's just that we're **very** proud to be a distinct and separate people. Misinformation can simply offend some and confuse others.There are some similarities between the two histories, however I feel as though anti-Zionist Jews are a case unto themselves. Best not complicate things by drawing false comparisons.Again, apologies for the tone.
Miami Cubans are self hating Latinos who are extremely right wing and reactionary
Why do these people have a fucking opinion about something they are blissfully unfucking aware of or have to deal with the results of war. Like take your opinion and shove it up ur ass where it belongs. You are not apart of this war and if you were you‚Äôd wish you were anywhere else.
This is why I think she is tearing them down. It is the propaganda of Israel being the main victim.
I worked at the writing lab at my university. I couldn‚Äôt believe they were giving degrees to ppl who could barely put together a full sentence. To me, a degree means a) you committed and stuck it out, and b) you had the means to stick with it.
Except they are bombing the hell out of that area. There‚Äôs been more bombs dropped on Palestine than on Afghanistan during the entire U.S. occupation.
Even in my early 20s i thought "adults" were way more responsible and had things figured out. Im 34 now and it's mind blowing how many terrible and dumb people are out there
She said she didn‚Äôt support Hamas. Supporting Palestine as well is not supporting Hamas.
Wow.
Ew. They are left. Just not left of hungry Santa as you'd want.
Israel is committing Genocide. Israel is the wrong.
Sounds like something a karma farmer would say
Being an adult has shown me that education =|= intelligence
üíÄ It‚Äôs not bigoted. You just don‚Äôt want to have an actual conversation with someone that knows what they are talking about. Just want an echo-chamber.I love my Muslim brothers, but they are following an evil religion that constantly calls for the murder of Jews and Christians. It‚Äôs in their text.
I have a degree, sir.
Hey if there are americans held hostage, maybe the US shouldn‚Äôt have been the only country in the UN to vote against a ceasefire and instead supply israel with even more weapons of mass destruction.If you care so much, tell your politicians to ask for a cease fire.
B-17 pilot literally got 3 seconds to figure out what was happening and couldn‚Äôt even finish the word oh shiiiiiittt!
Interesting way to dodge the questionü•¥You said it has to do with white privilege. If the Israelis were persecuting the Palestinians (which they arent), then how in the world is that related to white privilege?If Israelis are white, then the Arabs are white. If both the persecutors and the persecuted are white, then it‚Äôs kinda dense to say white privilege is relevant. Man those Palestinians are so lucky to have that white privilege.Anyways, no. The reason Jews have support is because some people have enough brainpower to look at history and see the truth behind what‚Äôs going on in Israel. Hamas is an absolutely evil organization centered around Jihad and the destruction of Jews. It‚Äôs antisemitism. Islam is evil.
Why would you post missing Israeli posters in Miami?
Miami Cubans are the worst. Absolute GOP bootlickers it‚Äôs actually insane and weird af
I think the title's framing is dishonest. These aren't actual missing posters. They are protest/propaganda posters.One can debate whether or not the woman in the video was wrong to tear down the posters, but I think that debate can only start from a place of honesty. Also, it's pretty clear its a coordinated thing, probably from somewhere in Israeli government as the same tactic is happening in major cities around the world.
Just because u/TroyFerris13 isn‚Äôt talking about, it doesn‚Äôt mean it stopped being discussed.
In her defence they are unlikely to be found in Miami
100% support him
‚Ä¶ do you consider the Palestinians white?
Propaganda to fuel hatred of Palestinians pure and simple.
That is one sweaty ass.
They are a traumatised people and they are enacting their trauma on innocent Palestinians
‚Ä¶ who are the white oppressors?
My university has posters up of missing Palestinians. I don‚Äôt rip those down crying about ‚Äúpropaganda‚Äù because I‚Äôm a normal person.
Your little group Hamas cry the blues every time you're losing. You should have thought about what you were doing when you paraded the innocent girl in the back of your Toyota truck. You created your own problem now you have to deal with it
terrible camera work. GO DOWN A BIT
So you are saying antisemitism is justified because of what Israel does? Are all Jews Israeli? Do all Jews represent Israel? What‚Äôs wrong with you?
Arresting of individuals for which there is actionable intelligence is not abducting, nor is it going bed to bed and executing everyone in them.
Decades??? *laughs but also crying* Millenia my friend.  Conflicts over the Holy Lands have been going on for millenia.
Keep supporting genocide. Fascist
I remember people in European countries putting up similar posters of American victims after 9/11. I thought it was done to show solidarity
I remember people in European countries putting up similar posters of American victims after 9/11. I thought it was done to show solidarity
Where far leftist ideology and right wing extremism meet in the middle. You are a special kind of retarded.
just make another
You know, a maneuver like this was actually used by the Germans in WW2 (mostly as a last ditch attempt) to get those flying fortresses down.
And why would the Arab world welcome the Jewish community when Israel shows no respect for them?
CNN routinely parrots Hamas talking points out of the Palestinian "Ministry of Health". They're absolutely not simping for Israel.
This movie is more and more relevant as America is empire in decline.
Were they waiting for somebody to take one down?
Mate, you forgetting that Israel had been abducting innocent Palestinians from their homes for a long long time................both are terrorists, nothing short. Just one has been doing it a lot longer, with a greater scale, with more sophisticated weapons and technology, and resources, and the cover of international support.
Hamas is responsible. Israel is fighting Hamas, and Hamas is holding hostages from both sides.The difference is Israel isn‚Äôt trying to kill Palestinians, it is trying to kill Hamas. Hamas is trying to kill any Israeli, and they would if they did have control over all of Israel. There isn‚Äôt a single Arab nation in the world that hasn‚Äôt completely destroyed its Jewish community. Israel is the only place they could go. Hamas wants to annihilate all Jews around the world. You wanna prove me wrong?
 You must think the Arabs are a bunch of idiots if you thought the point of creating a pro rights and sovereignty party is to get more supporters to die. The only time there has been a peace treaty or agreement between Israel and Palestine has been as a time of a conflict / war, that's the point of this up rising, change.
In what way are they leftist?  I wish they were lol
Spray them with black paints
I see you look at this from a spiritual perspective. But that perspective tends to forget those left behind, wich is basically the whole premise from my point of view
Because Hamas goes into civilian homes to kill civilians, whereas Israel bombs civilian homes to get to fighters and weaponry that Hamas put there to deter Israel from responding.Do you not see a difference?
There are also 600 American citizens living in Gaza. Would it be fair to also post images of them? I ask purely for information. I think it would be consistent at least.
‚Ä¶ what does white privilege have to do with Israel?
How effective are those posters when they are erected in Miami???
The places aren‚Äôt the problem‚Ä¶ religion is.  People believe what a bunch of goat herders wrote in books about their understanding of the universe 1000s of years ago.  Even believers conveniently don‚Äôt practice the parts that are inconvenient to them or would be looked down upon in modern society.
fucking idiot
Yeah but there are like 8 billion people but less than 50 B17s.
Women drivers..pfft
What do you do ? Are you even a adult ?
Reverse 9/11
Mmm ty masa
Everyone in my office was white when I arrived and I asked why. They said its because we have been hiring family and friends. So they decided to look outside and actually hire others. Now should I say wow thanks for hiring me or should I say you lot suck a bag of dinky dicks and it's jarring having to live with you sometimes? üòâ
The fuck are you talking about, there were decapitated babies. Maybe Hamas didn't behead them with a sword, execution style, but they definitely bashed at least one baby's head in and burned others alive. There are photos. Not to defend Israel, they're a menace, but Hamas bears plenty of responsibility for driving a worse outcome for Palestinians. That's the whole point of the movement, to create more martyrs.
Yeah why does it upset you that I'm honest about white people ? ü§î
Degree in Dumbness, a DD with a sweaty ASS
Honestly dude just release all the prisoners they want released. Get the hostages back. Then bomb them to oblivion. Who cares who they release. They‚Äôre dead men walking after what they did.
Oh yeah but the people who died don‚Äôt matter. Such a tragedy that an old plane can‚Äôt fly anymore!You can restore a plane but you can‚Äôt revive a human.

As if they are gonna find them in Miami Beach or something, it‚Äôs payed propaganda
Your a social worker ....... ya whatever. Lmao.
wrong. the reason these jewish charedim are showing support for palestine is not cause they care about palestinians, but because they don‚Äôt support israel in a religious sense. they don‚Äôt give a shit about palestinians
So you support babies being murdered then??    /s
Does waving a Palestinian flag in a prestige university frees Palestine? Why none of y‚Äôall got shit to say about that ?
You could be on the side of the whole world would be better if neither of these places existed. Seriously how many decades of fighting are we on already? They're never going to stop.
&gt; ATC screwupshould have gone with the grigri instead
Yeah, it's a way of making sure the public doesn't forget the hostages amidst all the other reporting on the war.And a lot of people who have already picked a side don't like it because it reminds other people that Hamas aren't just a bunch of plucky freedom-loving underdogs who would never do anything bad.
Gonna help ratio you with the actual, factual, and netanyahu admitted information that Hamas is indeed one of Israels crimes
The irony is it is becoming the view of the majority. No human can stand by and condone the treatment of Palestinians regardless of their nationality. If you do, shame on you for supporting genocide. You are just as bad as the Nazis.
You're delusional, stop parroting israeli propaganda.
Besides be reminded israel spends all our tax money on propaganda campaigns while genociding
I completely agree mate. Was trying to say that CNN are reporting there like they are friendlies while pedaling misinformation like decapitated babies which drives a worse outcome for Palestinians
If you‚Äôre too dumb to understand I can‚Äôt explain it to you. I only hope your ideology doesn‚Äôt spread because you are the scum of the earth.
Terror or war? Why is it terror when it is Hamas but war when it is Israel. Propaganda......
Were they all wearing aviators or just a few of them?
Fair question. In some cases, they were pretty much the only ones around, meaning that they were standing some distance away from the groups they were filming or photographing.  Shireen Abu Akleh's assassination is famous because we have it on video and she was clearly not standing anywhere near anyone else other than a cameraman, with both Shireen and the cameraman clearly identified as members of the press.Ghufran Harun Warasneh was shot almost at point-blank range while wearing his "Press" flake jacket.Yusef Abu Hussein had a bomb dropped on his house to stop him from reporting.Now look at the number of journalists killed on the Israeli side of border...none. No Hamas rockets have killed any journalists. Not Hamas gunmen have killed any journalists.
absolutely based. saying you want better for the people in palestine can make you lose your job but they allow israeli propaganda like this, its not fair
People need to find something other than ideology to base their whole personalities on.
Me neither
Is the $4,000,000,000.00 per year not enough support‚ÄΩ
They can do two things at once.
That's terrible.  Were they the only ones around? Or how do you know they didn't get caught by a stray round?
And who was backing Hamas during their rise to power ü§î
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre in Miami to be fair
It is a truly beautiful thing that we must pick a side between two teams of murderers.
Why do people act as if having a degree, or in this case ‚Äúdegrees‚Äù, implies that they are better than someone else. It‚Äôs laughable.
Wonder where all the posters for American citizens trapped in Gaza are?
Hamas needs to be wiped out
I‚Äôm very confused. Sorry, all.
Far out ! That was next level
Propaganda to report on hamas terror? What‚Äôs wrong with you? The world hates hamas despite what you people try to claim.
![gif](giphy|c9tVMERePnnDW)
Yea this was a huge loss for the aviator community
Not to defend her, but I‚Äôm sure missing Israelis kidnapped by Hamas would not be found in Miami, Florida ‚Äî the posters are just a waste of ink, to be honest.
Hamas are a Palestinian resistance fighters. They have been resisting the ongoing Israeli military occupation of their homeland, Palestine. Israel was developed in 1948 by an agreement from the British to colonize Palestine. Israel has been stealing Palestinian land while killing and torturing the Palestinian people since 1948 with the support of Britain. What Israel is doing and has been doing for the past 75 years is Genocide. They try so hard to frame it in other ways as to show Hamas as an Islamic terrorist group but Israel also targets and kills Palestinian Christians too. The Israeli military just bombed one of the oldest churches in the world in Gaza. They break and have been breaking every international law there is. The Israeli military and its regime deliberately target innocent civilians including entire families, journalists, paramedics while bombing schools, residential buildings, hospitals and Churches. Israel is now trying to wipe out the rest of the Indigenous people of Palestine from the little land that they have left while killing every Palestinian man, woman and child in its way. The only difference now that the previous 75 years is that now the world is watching. It‚Äôs as clear and simple as it sounds, we are now witnessing the ethnic cleansing and genocide of the Palestinian people.
The same type of people were harassing Palestinians to remove Palestinian flags in Brooklyn by comparing them to Hamas supporters. They have an agenda.
I think it‚Äôs to keep it in the news and put pressure on governments to help find a solutionThe first priority should be to get the hostages back safely and the US and EU governments have a lot of control Also, why does it bother people so much that it‚Äôs up? Its weird
Hamas was created thanks to Israel's help in meddling with the elections against the PLO and Fattah. Israeli officials own words were that Hamas was made for their benefit:   https://theintercept.com/2018/02/19/hamas-israel-palestine-conflict/
It's gaslighting, they'd try to convince you that fox news was leftist if anyone would listen to them.
To make you feel a certain way with a specific group of people. Could be called ummm... Propaganda??
Hamas did that to themIsrael says leave this is comingHamas says stay in your houses. They say stay in your homes for 2 reasons1. Using Gaza residents as political cannon fodder2. Using Gaza residents as human shields to protect them. I think 2. Is the biggest reason. Bunch of cowards who talk about jihad and total war, when it comes to them they hide behind civilians.Wake up Gaza. You voted these terrorists into office in 2007.What do you have to show for it?Sounds like you have to show what you asked for.
Public spaces. He can put that shit up and she can take that shit down. What a fucking bully.
Miami cubans are very pro Israel
Nice lie guys
You would prefer no reporting on global conflicts?
Hamas is bothAn elected govt that runs a terrorist stateBottom line
Disgusting how they are shining a spotlight on their ordeal for the whole world to see. I guess CNN and other news media should ignore Palestine and pretend the war doesn't exist? What exactly is the fucking goal here?
idk he started it then got his ass beat dude seems like a dickhead
Yeah, the Nakba happened during and after the war in 1948. Which again, was started by Palestinians and units of the ALA.
The Nakba, has entered the chat......
Finally someone said what needed to be said
ü§°
Omfg, the posters are up in South Florida because there are a lot of dual citizens here and people who travel back and forth between the two countries. Same with New York. Their families/community members may be here and may have information on their whereabouts even if the missing persons themselves are abroad.Too many commenters don't know shit about our communities and are awfully quick to make sweeping accusations. You can hate on Israel all you want, but you don't need to figuratively and literally tear our loved ones down.
Or op just decided to repost it. Just because something has been posted once doesn‚Äôt mean that everyone on Reddit has seen it. I for one hadn‚Äôt seen it before now
When Jews refuged to British-mandated Palestine following the Balfour Declaration in 1917. Palestine issued a war of attrition against their Jewish population, killing off thousands of Jews, hitting nearly 80 casualties per day.Even when Israel was declared a state in 1948. Palestinians revolted, which in turn, displaced themselves.Not to mention the handfuls of wars started by Palestinians against Israel and neighbouring countries.I don‚Äôt agree on either side, but to label Palestine as innocent within this feud is just as bad as an alt-right holocaust denier.History supersedes political beliefs.Edit: The amount of downvotes indicates the amount of people denying history. Even while having a moderate opinion on the matter, pro-Palestinian supporters fail to recognize Palestine's wrongdoings, or sweep them under the rug.You want to speak on propaganda? Well here it is, in all it's glory. Downvoting and silencing historical facts because it fails to fit in their narrative of Palestine being the only victims within this century long conflict.Both Israel and Palestine should be condemned for their actions. Both can be wrong on different spectrums.
This comment section is a hard read ngl. I hate the world I was born into
Protesting the US not giving them a green light to carpet bomb Gaza into dust. No lie. The only reason they don't just slaughter the whole area is because it would lose them all US support in minutes.
And Hamas are freedom fighters fighting against occupation.
Thought they were toy planes until the explosion
That was a sweet Monte Carlo
isn‚Äôt this a stunt? Why would one start randomly start filming approaching dog walkers before doing anything?
I don't see how the posters in the US are anything more than Littering. They aren't going to be found in Miami or the US and 99% of people don't take their shit down they leave it to rot.
Why risk losing support of the west for pushing out all the arabs of your ‚Äûholy land‚Äú when you can just create reasons to justify that same ethnic cleansing. ‚ÄúThose who want to thwart the establishment of a Palestinian state should support the strengthening of Hamas and the transfer of money to Hamas. This is part of our strategy, to differentiate between the Palestinians in Gaza and the Palestinians in Judea and Samaria.‚Äù - Bibi
Yeah it happened last year. Op is karma farming
They shouldn't take down any posters but start putting up posters of missing and lain Palestinians in Miami. The number of posters without repeating any person (babies, kids, women included) would be absurd and hard to see, but I am sure nobody would support baby K1LL3Rs
This is probably the only time i wont argue over a repost. I never knew this happened now i do.
He passed away.
Can we put up posters in Washington for missing palestinians?
I mean, they probably aren't keeping them in Miami.
Dumbasses in America with no dogma other than what their talking heads tell them siding with zionist terrorism....
What propaganda? Israel has been occupying Palestinians‚Äô land and ethnically cleansing the area since 1948.
CNN have been a consistent embarrassment and propaganda machine for Israel this conflict. They deserve all the stick they get.
What happened is sad but i think they doing some propaganda on it, using those events to pump the hate of the population.Now the woman taking the posters down, it probably comes from a feeling of injustice that the palestinien civilian ( we talking kids, babies, entire family being wipped out of the register) getting bombed to oblivion don't get the same coverage ( not saying it justify taking the posters down)
Sooo‚Ä¶ *propaganda?*
It‚Äôs propaganda, they‚Äôre doing it in London too
Because it‚Äôs propaganda
Marketing
might as well be chanting "KRI-STALL-NACHT"
"Man cheering on targeted massacres of unarmed civilians including families, literal babies and attendees of an interreligious intercultural peace festival by an organization literally claiming in their charta that 'there can be no peace while there are still jews alive' complaining about 'genocide' against one of the populations with the largest growth rate of the planet."Looking at the demographics, if this was a "genocide", this would be the most incompetent genocide attempt in the history of humanity. Facts.Also there would be A LOT less civilian casualties in Gaza if the Hamas would not deliberately build their command bunkers &amp; rocket bases below schools, hospitals &amp; mosques. But getting more palestinian civilians killed is a benefit, not a negative for them, which is why they literally stop evacuation attempts at gunpoint. But sure, *those* are the credible "brave liberators". The only thing they ever liberated is civilians on both sides from being alive.
For the kidnapped people who are American citizens. Just the other day an American grandmother and her 12 year old  granddaughter were originally kidnapped and recently found murdered by Hamas. They are trying to draw attention to the fact that American citizens are still being held hostage there. It‚Äôs a fairly common tactic for other causes whatever or whoever side you are taking. https://www.cbsnews.com/amp/news/israel-hamas-war-abbey-onn-carmela-dan-noya-killed/
Idk they had that shit on an nba game tonight too. Like what am I going to do with this information lol
Protesting what? the billions Israel gets from the US every year?
Full respect for not pretending to understand like most of gen z
CNN‚Äôs coverage has been really biased. Love how they try to call CNN leftist, nope, they simp Israel
This journalist is lucky an IDF soldier didn‚Äôt point blank shoot her ,they have quite the track record.
Number of these posters I‚Äôve seen in real life: 0Number of videos I‚Äôve seen of people tearing them down: 4If it wasn‚Äôt for these people I wouldn‚Äôt even know the posters existed.
Miami is too small to fit all the ~4,000 imprisoned and missing posters.
Id be throwing boiling water down at them
What's stopping her from putting up posters of missing Palestinians instead of just tearing down posters?
Not as international sponsored aidGenerally Israel teaching isn't focused on Arabs/Muslims/Palestinians/Palanstine
It's good to resist propaganda
His brothers are dead fyi, plus torturing children is just a false claim with no evidence
What do people think the hostages are in Miami or something?
It's probably just to make people empathise. People have a tendency to not reflect on stuff if they don't have a human element to connect to. Making people actually see the faces of the people affected by something is a more effective way to make people care than just like a news reading or something.
there are genocidal teachings within israelis
No enough room for all the missing and killed Palestinians
This is why she was ripping them down. Not sure how I feel about her doing it, but she's doing it because there aren't posters for the Palestinian casualties as well which are far far greater. Its infuriating how they want sympathy for those on their side that died while still condoning far worse atrocities that their country is committing. Just this incident alone has 3x more Palestinian innocent casualties and they're just getting started.
In my country the CIDI (local version of the ADL basically) is putting up 40 high way bill boards like this. Luckily one of the Palestinian charities has also crowd funded one of these for the palestinians, but its ofc a much shorter campaign.To me it seems like they want to keep the hostages in the news which is a good thing. But their other intention is to keep reminding people of their justification for murdering civilians.
What is up with putting up these missing posters of people missing in a far away country and then doxxing people when they tear them down?Reeks of propaganda and political stunts.
International donations used to keep the hate and violence cycleEducation should be used to bring people up not down, there is a lot of brainwashing kids, if you lookup and see samples of the teaching it's pretty bad.I'm not saying not to teach the truth or history of your people and such but there is pure hate material there and stoking the flames of violence, hate and genocide philosophy
They need some milk
so people speaking up about the rage they have towards the systemic genocide of their people ?
It's worse if you keep getting more infoThey also don't just steal all the aim, get rich and don't care about the people, they actually disassemble civilian infrastructure in favour of rockets

Very well explained. I would add to it that we can already see what a possible solution would be, dialog and moderation. The people ‚Äúliving‚Äú in Gaza will never prosper while Hamas stays in the picture. We can see the West Bank example, with a more moderate stance not governed by terrorists people can go about their lives relatively at peace with their neighbours. But as long as we have big players like Iran fueling the conflict, Oil money poring in from many sources to buy weapons, training and technical expertise supplied to terrorist groups, this conflict will never end.Strangely enough this conflict comes at a very convenient time where a close ally of Iran is involved in another conflict of its own and needs to divide efforts of their major opponent.
Disgusting how they are there "reporting" while pedaling Israel and American propaganda that fucks them over even more
"Oh shit oh my fucking god are you serious bro this shit really just happened"Eloquent.
There is a lot of Jewish in Iran especially in Isfahan I wish people read and educate themselves lol
Ok but what‚Äôs her @
If people put up posters of Palestinian children killed in air strikes wouldn‚Äôt they deserve to stay up?
Maybe you spend too much of your life on reddit. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve seen it so who gives a shit, just scroll past it.
He's got a pretty decent point there..
Why are people putting up posters for missing Israelis thousands of miles away from Israel? It‚Äôs pure propaganda.
whataboutism gets you nowhere. an eye for an eye makes the whole world blind. and where is the ‚Äòmission including schools that contain teaching to violence and hate against jews‚Äô ?
To curry support for the Israeli military action.
Do they expect to find these people in Miami? Where are the posters for missing Palestinians? It‚Äôs propaganda.
The UN has an Arab country majority and has passed more calls against Israel than any country in the world, no matter how many humanitarian violations others make and the properties are crazy at how much the UN cares about Israel vs anything else they could be doing. UN also has missions including schools that contains teaching to viloance and hate against the Jews and Israel for Palestineshttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_United_Nations_resolutions_concerning_Israel
...And then our public spaces become littered with layers of old posters from previous points of view.  The answer is no posters in the first place.  Speak in the public square don't litter it.
Certainly interesting, I must say.
No one is stopping you from doing so. And if you did would you see people removing them as combating propaganda? No. I‚Äôm with anyone that looking out for civilians. That‚Äôs the rational choice here. I‚Äôm not for the destruction of Palestinians or the destruction of Israel. I want the bombing to stop and an accord reached.
Hate for specific groups is taught. Tribalism though, is baked in.
What a dip-shit comment.
No because it‚Äôs propaganda
Hamas started all of this as usual. Now crying because Israel punched back.
Everyone survived. They were treated and released. One had a broken wrist and a cut on his hand.

Well, that‚Äôs not really how the American government works.  It doesn‚Äôt instantly bend to the will of public opinion.  It‚Äôs a slow, ponderous system (by design).  But yeah, if the public doesn‚Äôt support something, the supporters of that thing will be slowly voted out of office, or realign their views to match their constituents so they get reelected.  At least in theory.  Clearly this is not always born out in practice, especially with how divided the US political system has become.  But my point stands.  Even now, the democrats are crafting an aid bill for Ukraine and Israel together, so the republicans won‚Äôt shoot it down because they support Israel (but have completely flipped on support for Ukraine).Additionally, Israel no longer needs the support of the US to stand on its own.  The US could cut ties with Israel TODAY, and HAMAS would be no better off.  The bombs would keep falling, because Israel has a modern economy and produces the vast majority of the assets it needs to wage war.  The US aid each year sits at around 2 billion (2022).  That‚Äôs less than 10% of what Israel spends on its military with its own capital, which was about 22 billion in 2022.  These figures are obviously going to change massively as the US is looking at sending Israel something like 15 billion this year.  Again, the events of October 7th are the cause of this massive increase in support for Israel in both public opinion and military aid.
I think right now it‚Äôs more trendy to be pro Palestine everything without having a clear understanding of the overall situation ‚Ä¶ so, get news from 10 mins of social scrolling, see how popular it is to be outraged and then join the outrage for yourself.
I feel bad for everyone that falls for the propaganda coming from all sides.
I apologise if I caused any offence. I was trying to explain how someone else had explained the similarity with Jewish separatists in Jerusalem to help contextualise it.I‚Äôm not an expert on Irish history, so thank you for clarifying.
Jews and Muslims live great side by side in Israel as long as a settler doesn't want to take your home from you.

Lol you think the US government gives a shit about the opinion of its citizens? Congress has less than a 20% approval rating. Damn so you‚Äôre telling me after decades of being slaughtered, it was just about to stop right before Hamas attacked? Damn what a coincidence
It's a form of protest. I wish there were more of those for those literal thousands of Palestinians civilians that are killed pretty often in their open air concentration camps.

Posters of missing people on the other side of the world from where those people are is not an honest attempt at finding them, it‚Äôs just Israeli propaganda. Why don‚Äôt people get this? She‚Äôs removing Zionist propaganda that is only there to distract you from the brutal war crimes of the IDF that are happening as you read this and have been happening daily for decades.
Not at all, its the bastardization of such things, otherwise do you think these jews would be doing this? Zionism is a political move to eradicate anyone that does not belong in their homeland, it is a genocidal ideology that may have been birthed from what was faith but it was transformed into an amalgam form, a grotesque mutilation of any belief. The same can be said about any belief, anything can be used as a weapon, one of my favorite scenes from book of eli higlighted this best.(https://youtu.be/A2ttSv7I9HY?si=8_ptPjqYTnAPt6Z-)
Which it was!  Literally support for Israel had been weakening around the world.  Israel was being raked over the coals for the apartheid nature of its control of Gaza and the strip.  Support from the US population was weakening.  But then HAMAS commits an objectively horrific terror attack.  Before the attack, support from the US population for Israel was hovering around 30%.  It now sits at 49%.  Kinda took the wind out of their own sails with that move, and now plenty of people can justify air strikes, the blockade of humanitarian materials and relief, and even a ground invasion of Gaza.  The IDF and Israeli government wasted no time turning that into a reason to replace the boot with JDAMs.  Was the attack by HAMAS understandable?  Absolutely.  Is the response to that attack by Jews living abroad understandable, like putting up posters of missing Israelis?  Absolutely.Article I pulled statistics of support for Israel from: https://today.yougov.com/politics/articles/47657-americans-support-for-israel-is-growing-amid-its-war-with-hamas
Starship Troopers
The answer is for Israel not to continue their apartheid state
The answer is not to take down the posters. Put up your own posters if you want.
these are jews from a certain neighborhood in Jerusalem that stood there before the state was created. they oppose the state of Israel because they believe the messiah hasn't arrived yet. they do believe that the entire land, including Gaza, belongs to the jews, just not now, only after the messiah arrives. they are a different kind of crazy, and you'd be a fool to think they care about Palestinians.
This made me so happy.
I‚Äôm not trying to justify it. I‚Äôm pointing out that the root cause of the violence are the colonizers. Great effort by Israel is put into getting people to focus on the violence of the oppressed so that people can scream ‚Äúboth sides are bad!‚Äù or ‚ÄúNo innocent people should die!‚Äù  as if that wasn‚Äôt obvious. The focus should be on the colonizing force and their violent oppression
Well, the Native Americans were not a monolith.  Some tribes were friendly with the colonizers until they realized the colonizers would not stop displacing them.  Some tribes resisted the colonizers (Spain, who got in the door first) from the moment they set foot in Florida.  And for some tribes, taking prisoners, torture and rape were a part of warfare.  Just like its has been throughout history and, as you pointed out, the colonizers waged a brutal, genocidal campaign against the native population (using the same tactics that they called native tribes ‚Äòbarbaric‚Äô for using).  I guess the point is, we can understand why people commit heinous acts against their enemies, but I really don‚Äôt like how you are trying to justify it. That‚Äôs how you get an eastern front, a war of annihilation where every target is valid.  That‚Äôs one of the ways the colonizers justified genocide.  That is not a type of war we should want any side to justify, in any conflict.  Appreciate the responses by the way, even though we don‚Äôt see eye to eye, I enjoy engaging with differing views from my own without it devolving into ad hominems, so thanks!
Why did Hamas start the war with israel? Why did they have to kidnap innocent civilians and innocent babies two and three and eight years old? Why did the Palestinian people cheer in the streets as the dead body of a young woman was carted around in the back of a Toyota pickup truck? You see no war is good everybody pays a price in war. But maybe just maybe Palestine will quit allowing Hamas terrorists to run their country every time somebody gives them land. Why did Hamas send Rockets from Palestine into Israel for the Iron Dome to accept for the last 5 years? Surely you can't possibly be a Hamas sympathizer. You need to learn some facts
I would‚Äôve left them chanting all night in the cold.
Zionism literally contradicts Jewish scripture
The photos from the other side will stay with me as you see ppl flying out the back in the debris and the pilot hanging on in the cockpit. Ripüåπ
Why? Why were these two released and none of the others including Israelis. The first two to be released. What makes them special? Did someone pay for their release? What did Hamas get for releasing them? What promises or prisoners or funds were released?
At least he is alive , unlike some isreal kids that got tortured
Can you explain a bit more for someone who has absolutely no knowledge of this?
BUNCH. OF. DORKS. BUNCH. OF. DORKS. BUNCH. OF. DORKS.
You‚Äôre not understanding, the Indians didn‚Äôt start killing innocent people because they thought the colonizers would leave them alone. They were already being wiped out and murdered for decades and realized that there was no hope. The anger is what led to those attacks. Would it have been better if the Indians just laid back and let them women be raped and babies murdered without doing it back? There would have been less casualties. The fact is however that the bad guys who started it were the colonizers. They would not have left them alone if they stayed peaceful the whole time. The point of a genocide and to colonize is to exterminate the population.
It‚Äôs not a hamas flag
Sports have, historically, not shied away from politics. This mindset has arisen over the last twenty years, where I live, in the United States. There are examples of athletes getting involved in politics from the early 20th century through today. There are likely examples prior to that, but pro sport largely evolved in the 20th century with the rise of broadcasting. From what I've seen, the mental overlap never really ceased outside of the US. The main reason it has here, is the mindset it will cut into profit margins.
As someone with a fair amount of Neturei Karta in their family, they literally could not give the barest hint of a flying fuck about Palestinian human rights. Don't be fooled. They're just a convenient foil for NK's oddly specific messianic beliefs.

I can totally understand where you are coming from.  Native Americans massacring colonizers is understandable, but that doesn‚Äôt make it justified.  That‚Äôs the key here.  We can understand how someone in Gaza could be radicalized by horrible conditions and the actions of the IDF.  But that doesn‚Äôt justify the rape and torture of civilians (who literally might not have any more love for the IDF than the terrorists carrying out the terror attack).  You can‚Äôt rape defenseless civilians, kill babies, and kidnap non-combatants and say, ‚Äúwell, they started it!‚Äù  If HAMAS had only attacked valid military targets, they would absolutely have a leg to stand on.  As it stands, they chopped that leg off of themselves by murdering hundreds of innocent people.Also, look at history.  How did that work out for the Native Americans?  The US left them alone once they understood that they pushed the Native Americans into retaliating, right?  Oh, wait, it increased American support for the genocide of the indigenous population.
It‚Äôs hard to give CPR to a lightly broiled wad of ground meat.
Are these posters up because people think these kids will be found in Miami?
That guy driving the GMC truck really parked like an asshole
Go on..
The issue is there is not right or wrong side i'm this conflict, they are all at fault or responsable for a part of the conflict itself, Hamas is human trash and a bunch of terrorists, the goverment of Israel haven't done right and they are in many cases Commiting war crimes (the resettleling and probably other stuffs), the palestinian people never built their country or society, not even when they could, and the Israel people could try to be more empatic with them and try to stop the extreme right. Now is a bit late for most of that and the solutions are complicate.
No not bear the Mc
Degrees, plural?Okay, I'll give you "communications," but what's the other one?
Serves them right and anyone willfully entering a war zone even for the sake of reporting. Fuck that shit.
Right but you have one side that is an occupying force that is backed by the U.S with billions in funding. They can actually spread propaganda. They can also shut off the food, water and electricity of the people they have been systemically killing off for decades. What‚Äôs wrong with spreading it? Nothing if it wasn‚Äôt being used to manufacture consent so Israel can ramp up their genocide. Israeli government doesn‚Äôt even care about the hostages, they said so themselves. The point of it is to distract you from the fact that this violence is happening because one side  has been systematically killing and pushing out the other. The natives in the U.S also killed innocent people but their innocent were being killed for decades before. Should the Indians have killed innocent people? No, but who was really at fault, the colonizers or the Indians?
It's not my place to say. All I know is that this problem is bigger than Isreal and Gaza. If this happened to my country, I think I would have a Tugsten Fist.
ATC screwup, they flew how they were told and little guy couldn't see B-17 below
Thankfully this didn't happen 10-20 seconds sooner. Crazy to think a bunch of people on the ground could have been hit by that fireball.
It‚Äôs supposed to bring attention to the events of October 7th, even as it falls out of the media and public‚Äôs (ridiculously short) attention span.  It‚Äôs a form of propaganda, yes, but that‚Äôs war for you.  Full of propaganda from both sides.  If a nation doesn‚Äôt fight on the propaganda front, they are seriously hamstringing themselves.  Not saying these individuals are agents of Israel, but they are supporters of Israel and we all go to bat for the nation we identify with when push comes to shove.But what is so wrong about bringing attention to kidnapped Israeli citizens?  It happened.  It‚Äôs not a fabricated event or false flag operation, it‚Äôs factually accurate that civilians were kidnapped en masse on October 7th.  These people posting the posters would rather the public didn‚Äôt forget that.If someone wanted to put up posters of missing Palestinians, that would be totally valid.  I can imagine a person walking down the street and seeing all the missing Palestinian and Israeli civilians.  Could actually be a powerful image, to show the suffering of the civilian population on both sides, who are the real victims in this war.Quick edit: the term propaganda is a loaded and negative term, which is why I ask why it‚Äôs wrong for these poster to go up.  You might not have meant it in such a negative way
And then that goes to isreal in the form of rockets.
Hamas was funded by Isreal to remove the PLO from power. They won local elections and since then have been a military force. Yet, what many don‚Äôt know you also have the Palestine Security Authority who work closely with Isreal on security matters that combat HamasZ very complex yet simple issue.

Hello
Talking about innocent lives while ripping down signs of innocent people who have been kidnapped is weird
Esp. because if the IDF see a vest with "Press" written on it, they're an instant target.Israel has always gone after anyone wearing a vest that says "Press" or "Medic". I don't know why journalists covering the fighting would wear such an obvious target on their chest when they know what happened to:* Mohammad Salhi (Palestinian, 2023, killed by IDF gunfire while wearing "Press" flak jacket and helmet)* Ghufran Harun Warasneh (Palestinian, 2022, shot in chest at close range by IDF gunman while wearing "Press" flak jacket and helmet)* Shireen Abu Akleh (American-Palestinian, 2022, assassinated by Israeli sniper while wearing "Press" flak jacket and helmet)* Yusef Abu Hussein (Palestinian, 2021, radio broadcaster assassinated by IDF bomb dropped onto his home by F-16)* Yasser Murtaja (Palestinian, 2019, shot by Israeli sniper while wearing "Press" flak jacket and helmet)* Ahmad Abu Hussein (Palestinian, 2018, shot by IDF gunman at close range while wearing "Press" flak jacket and helmet)* Simone Camilli (Italian, 2014, killed while photographing Palestinian efforts to diffuse a bomb dropped by an Israeli F-16)* Ali Shehda Abu Afash (Palestinian, 2014, killed alongside Simone Camilli while photographing Palestinian efforts to diffuse a bomb dropped by an Israeli F-16)* Mohammed Daher (Palestinian, 2014, newspaper editor, assassinated by IDF bomb dropped onto his home by F-16)* Mohammed Nour al-Din al-Deiri (Palestinian, 2014, killed in crowded market after IDF dropped bomb on people doing their grocery shopping)* Rami Rayan (Palestinian, 2014, killed in crowded market after IDF dropped bomb on people doing their grocery shopping)* Sameh al-Aryan (Palestinian, 2014, killed in crowded market after IDF dropped bomb on people doing their grocery shopping)* Ahed Zaqout (Palestinian, 2014, killed after IDF bomb dropped onto his home by F-16)* Khaled Hamad (Palestinian, 2014, killed by Israeli tank shelling while wearing "Press" flak jacket and helmet)* Hamid Shibab (Palestinian, 2014, killed by Israeli airstrike on his vehicle)* Mahmoud al-Kumi (Palestinian, 2012, killed by Israeli missile strike on his vehicle)* Hussam Salama (Palestinian, 2012, killed by Israeli missile strike on his vehicle)* Mohammed Abu Eisha (Palestinian, 2012, killed by Israeli missile strike on his vehicle)* Basil Ibrahim Faraj (Palestinian, 2009, killed by Israeli airstrike)* Fadel Shaana (Palestinian, 2008, killed by Israeli tank fire on his clearly Reuters press vehicle. Eight other journalists were killed in the vehicle).* Mohamed Abu Halima (Palestinian, 2004, shot in stomach at close range by IDF gunman while wearing "Press" flak jacket and helmet)* James Miller (British, 2003, killed by IDF gunfire at close range)* Nazeh Darwazi (Palestinian, 2003, shot in the head at close range by IDF gunman while wearing "Press" flak jacket and helmet)* Issam Hamza Tillawi (Palestinian, 2002, shot in the head by Israeli sniper while wearing "Press" flak jacket and helmet)* Imad Abu Zahra (Palestinian, 2002, shot in the leg by Israeli sniper and bled out)* Raffaele Ciriello (Italian, 2002, shot in the chest 6 times by IDF gunman while wearing "Press" flak jacket and helmet)* Muhammad al-Bishawi (Palestinian, 2001, killed by IDF bombing of office where he worked)* Othman al-Qatanani (Palestinian, 2001, killed by IDF bombing of office where he worked)Being a journalist filming Israeli war crimes is the most dangerous job in the world.
Fuck, for a second I thought we were looking at toy planes again
People don't realize all was ok tell hamas attacked isreal isreal didn't attack Palestinians so you can show your sob shit and remember hamas killed kids on purpose,  burning then alive isreal jets only see hamas targets not kids think about that.
He meant Iranian Jews and Baha'i (an Iranian religion) not Muslimsü§£
You no what isreal warned us that hamas would start showing dead baby's before they even dropped a bomb on Gaza shows how sick hamas is they try to use kids to stop themselves from be took out SCUM OF ALL SCUM.
"I have degrees"Another indictment of the American education system
It's  corrupt that he gives terrorist billions, removed oil restrictions on Iran, and he tries to bribe the enemy's, so that kind gives me the feeling he has taken bribes if that's how he does business.
The only good thing he's done is help ukraine and israel, but then again, if his policies weren't so weak, there wouldn't be any wars
My butthole would be pressed so tightly against that window.If that didn't work, leftover fireworks should clear the dozen IQ points in the parking lot.

Nice ass
I'm not even "pro" palestine or "pro" israel but I was watching CNN earlier today and was shocked at how biased it was towards the israeli viewpoints. They had a few stories about Palestinians to be fair but it almost felt token after a certain point.
These guys won‚Äôt even let you hang a Palestinian flag in your own country half-way around the world; now imagine how they treat actual Palestinians at home.
"I'm not misinformed, I have degrees." *Gross*
This is why there will always be conflicts. Human nature is to hate.
Where are the tables for thousands of Palestinian children killed by Isreali bombing....oh I forgot they are human animals...worse than dogs
Meanwhile I know of someone in Rural Pennsylvania that has a Nazi Swastika flag flying on their property.This world makes no fucking sense most of the time.
yes, the neturei karta. crazy bunch. their stance on palestine is admired by pro-palestinians because they "look" like stereotypical jews to these people. no one should be giving them any attention imo. if you want to amplify jews standing up for palestine, there are much better groups you could use
No, CNN has been completely atrocious and one sided in its coverage.
dont only go based off of what this guy is saying. https://www.ohchr.org/en/press-releases/2023/10/un-expert-warns-new-instance-mass-ethnic-cleansing-palestinians-callsthis is from the united nations

I‚Äôm so glad I‚Äôm not the only who doesn‚Äôt think Israel is right. I‚Äôm afraid to even say it out loud.
Please remember my comment, neither side has clean hands. Isreal isn't exactly innocent.  There's religion involved and holy sites and so much more to it than simple explanations.
It‚Äôs both.
No he isn't. CNN has taken a hard line supporting Israel.
You don't think Isreal are being a little heavy handed?
the combined iq of these people cannot be above 100
It's frustrating how these people are so sure that Jews and Christians were constantly persecuted in the Ottoman empire when they so clearly weren't
Free Palestine
Hamas means Islamic Resistance Movement.  It‚Äôs stated purpose is to annihilate the State of Israel.  It was an organization that started in the 80‚Äôs, became designated a Terrorist organization by the US in the 90‚Äôs and came to power/control Gaza in 2006.  Palestine or Gaza isn‚Äôt a country.  Gaza is just one land area near Israel that contains people that identify as Palestinians (for example, the West Bank is another area).  Palestine was a name given to the area during Roman and Greek times.  The people in the area didn‚Äôt see themselves as Palestinian until around WWI when a sense of national identity began to form around the various groups of people in the area. The area has been controlled by numerous countries/empires throughout history.  Never once did a Palestinian country ever exist.  If people who now identify as Palestinians gained their own country (two state solution) the boundaries would make Israel indefensible as the boundaries would geographically not make sense (boundaries determined by pockets of population and not natural geographical regions separated by rivers and mountains).  If Palestinians became one state with Israel, the Jews would lose all power since the Palestinian population is  so large. That is why you hear  Palestinian supporters calling to end the Apartheid in Israel (a reference to white minority rule in South Africa).  They can‚Äôt get along because they can‚Äôt co-exist on the same land - they both can‚Äôt have their own country in the same area of land.  When Hamas took control of Gaza, Israel placed strict control on the region to counter Hamas‚Äô influence.  A similar strategy the US uses on Cuba, North Korea, Iran, and now Russia.  Except Gaza is tiny and Israel borders the territory so they can do it more effectively.  Palestinian‚Äôs in Gaza support Hamas because they see Hamas fighting/resisting Israel - their oppressors.
Sorry about that! The link I posted didn‚Äôt have anything to do with that so I was confused. And admittedly defensive because there‚Äôs been a lot of confusion on this sub recently. :) Thanks for clarifying!

I think he‚Äôs confusing CNN with FoxNews.
Yup... America. Where you can legally protest.Notice nobody threw any rocks thru the window?
You are now all caught up on the current conflict. It‚Äôs a very long history of back and forth basically. Yes Hamas is a government. Yes they are terrorists. Terrorism is more of a ‚Äútactic‚Äù than a description of the organization. Both sides are awful. The people are just people. Most just want to live their lives in peace. Some support Palestine because they feel that Palestinians have been forced off their land by Israel. Those who support Israel see the suicide bombings and killings against Israeli civilians as acts of evil. Which they are. Hamas feels as though it‚Äôs their only tool in the box to fight against a country who is basically as powerful as the US militarily. It‚Äôs a long history with so much pain on both sides. It is not black and white. There is wrong on both sides. The only fact I can give you is that innocent people have been murdered on both sides of this conflict over the last 70 years.
I think most people understood that was what I was alluding to.
i looked it up and it said that biden gave iran $6 billion, if that‚Äôs what he did i‚Äôm not surprised tbh joe biden has done nothing but fucking everything up
So wait, they are protesting in the usa or in a placeover on the effected countries?
Dude,  The video was on this subreddit. This has nothing to do with Hamas and was well reported on by the western media.
Holy shit. Every other day with reposting this. Jfc.iT‚Äôs NeW tO mE!Nobody gives a fuck.

Both sides suck. This is a hot button subject. Very, very complex. Everyone on Reddit is gonna give you their perspective which will be biased. The best thing to do is do a quick google search and go down the rabbit hole. Find some books on the subject and read one.
They have been wanting to Nuke America for decades... dude, how do you know this? This is Basic, they don't even hide it. YouTube "Iran Death to America."
I'm sure the guy who has so far demonstrated nothing except their petulant ire has a clear grasp on what is actually happening in one of the, if not the most complex warzone in the world.You made a diluted and uninformed opinion. To which you were provided with multiple reasons (which are backed by sources) giving you the benefit of doubt, that more than a singular neuron occupies your head. But oh man of course. You alone are smart and can boil it down to one reason. Since 1948 men and women who have shaped and changed entire nations (some of which are world powers) lacked the mental acuity that you clearly are gifted with. Of course, how could they not see the singular reason you have so easily reduced this whole conflict too! We should have come seeking your wisdom ages ago. Nevermind how your previous post shot it's own argument in the knee. That was a flub! It can be the only reason. I mean why not. Clearly in all of humanity your root cause analysis of "iT Is rElIgIOn" must be the proper one. No one else could possibly have come up with this and tried to solve it from this angle!The existence of UN resolution 194 was a sham. All those people didn't even come close to your intelligence.Id say all this is funny, but I'm just shocked at how someone can be such a burden. All the resources provided by a first world country. And yet leeches like you waste it to be stupid and ignorant. What a waste.
oh fr? damn then this shouldnt be a problem for you since half of the people fighting in this war are below 25 (probably) and all those kids that are dying and the ones that died in the hospitalk? you shouldn't be worried about them since they arent people!
Oh my god that‚Äôs terrible! i didn‚Äôt realise it was so bad because i only heard what Israel has been doing so i thought they were the bad guys. thank you so much for telling me
Do you support women's rights? They hate you. Do you support gays or lesbians? They hate you.Are you American? They hate you.Are you a Jew? They hate you. You don't know verses from the Quran? They'll kill you. Are you an infidel? ^ same thing... they'll kill you. You aren't a believer of the Quarn? They'll rape you and your woman.Are you an infidel? They light your kids on fire. Do you think America has mental health issues...? Well, we are dealing with people who are no different than those in Afghanistan... those people send their kids out with bombs strapped to their chest, hoping it kills infidels. Don't believe me? I have friends who deployed who told me these stories.

I'm no expert but I can tell you a few things. Hamas is the elected governing body of the gaza strip part of palestine although elections haven't been held since like 2006 when they took power. Hamas has heavily invested in their military capabilities instead of building much needed infrastructure for the people of gaza. As a result, gaza still heavily relies on israel for utilities and as a corridor for supplies. I'm not sure if you've seen any footage of the hamas attack on israel, but it was a brutal act of terror. Israel's retaliation is against hamas who is launching rockets from the city to try to use civilians as human shields while they hide underground. Israel doesn't target civilians but they also won't hesitate if its to take out anything hostile. That's war. Because israel has seemingly been trying to make better relations with their neighbors like saudi arabia I think they genuinely want this shit to end. As far as I'm aware, jews are really hated amongst muslims and arabs and I'm sure it's reciprocated. I want this to be resolved but that won't happen with groups like hamas out there. I'm shocked at how much support hamas gets being what they are but a lot of people don't know just how back asswards their actions are. Hamas doesn't give a fuck about palestinians, they keep doing this because it's profitable. Get billions in aid, and funding for weapons from Iran and fuck knows whoever else to kill jews and stuff the leaders pockets. They are nothing but scum and should be wiped off the face of the earth. No negotiating with terrorists. Not saying palestine should be part of israel but these fuckers gotta go. Israel doesn't exactly have a halo in all this but I can at least say they want the best for their people and ultimately it'll be best for palestine if they can get some competent leadership. Thanks for reading my tangent.
Jewish Nazis hahahahaha you can‚Äôt make this shit up
Rest assured, you are not stupid. I'm not well enoughed verse to help you out, but I'm sure someone out there will.  Look at your sources. Neither side is innocent.
Bitch in purple just standing there like "well huh, you dont see that everyday.....you got the big macs eddie?"
Not particularly convincing though. The wiki mentions radio communications about what they were meant to be doing, as in the pilots speaking to each other during the event, and I imagine this pilot would mention hitting something and say something about a new and sudden control malfunction, but it was never noted by any pilots.
You are so focused on your perceived infallibility of religion that you can't seem to comprehend that people use religion to defend horrible actions on a regular basis.  The fact that you think that the politics at play here make it not a religious war despite the politics being based on religion is laughably stupid.
Thats the stuff, those lads get it.
They should have never capitulated‚Ä¶ sad day in the ‚Äúland of the free‚Äù
Lmao. A war between nationalists and an extremist party and your conclusion is "iTs rEligIouS".Nevermind that the law directs against it. Yet I am the one in contradiction while your own words are "people of one faith specifically targeting people of a different faith and using WARPED interpretations of their texts to defend their actions".If an interpretation is warped then it is not religion that is at fault because it's not directing it in the first place. Because it's been warped.All I can say is that you chose to be ignorant in the age of information.
Breaking bad reference!
Imagine if a bunch of arabs protested outside someone's house because they had an israeli flag. Hmm...something tells me that protest would be broken up pretty quickly
https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/world/dallas-midair-tragedy-new-videos-show-startling-change-in-flight-path-of-p-63/ar-AA14KpwDApparently it is a theory after several videos showed what appeared to be something that hit the fighter prior to the heavy bank. There was no registered drones in the area, thus is a theory. ... Took me 2 minutes to look this up instead of just flaming a dude. I would imagine this would be a popular theory as it would preserve the skill of the pilot(s) involved and ensure safer airspace for future airshows
They'll cry antisemtism
We live in very weird and confusing times
You're contradicting yourself repeatedly here.  Just because a religion is conceptually against a specific behavior doesn't mean that their followers are incapable of performing that action.  People of one faith are specifically targeting people of a different faith and using warped interpretations of their texts to defend their actions.  They are both performing wat crimes.  They are both running propaganda campaigns.  I can easily tell that you're a religious person because it seems that you struggle to comprehend that a religion's teachings being warped for violence and political gain is nothing new.  It's been happening ever since religion was created to control the masses.  THEY ARE DIFFERENTIATING FROM EACH OTHER BASED ON THEIR RELIGION.  THIS IS A WAR BASED ON RELIGION.  All I can say is pray to whatever God you believe in that hell make this more clear to you.
Woah
Not all Jews are Zionist.
kamikaze
This is the 15th time this has been posted in this subreddit since August.
From a very simple and linear point of view, both religions have severe penalties against killing non combatants (the party goes in Israel, the civilians in Gaza). Either side killing them are in gross violation of it. Just by that it is not a religious war.From a more in depth view. The land while related to in religion is focused on more a haven rather than it's religious value. You will not hear Israel say "all Jews need a home that is based on their homeland". Rather, that all Jews need a safe home. The pretext for establishing the land where it is might have have religious intonations however the conclusion that it is religion once again fails because the people who placed Israel where it is were atheist at most (UN and returning UK forces).The war has been propelled using extremist propaganda, which both Islam and Judaism are against. And only those who use singular verses in a vacuum from their texts ignorantly conclude that it is a religious war.The zionists in the Israeli government are largely nationalist and do not much care for Judaism. Their agenda is to establish, be it on genocide or multiple other war crimes.People associate Hamas' charter with Islamic direction, to wipe Israel out. But per the sequence of events leading up the day of judgement Israel is still around. How can they wipe something out if the religion they claim to do it for indicates that the state of Israel will be present till the end of days event? The conflict involves issues related to national identity, land ownership, borders, and geopolitics. Religion adds a layer of complexity to the conflict, but it's just one of many factors contributing to the ongoing tensions. The "right to return" as adopted by the UN resolution 194 for Palestinians has no mention of religion at all. It is a central concept in the Israel-Palestine conflict, focusing on the claims of Palestinian refugees and their descendants who were displaced during and after the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. This right is rooted in United Nations General Assembly Resolution 194, which was adopted in 1948. It asserts the Palestinians' right to return to their homes and receive compensation for their losses.However, implementing this right has been a major source of disagreement in the conflict. Israel has opposed the mass return of Palestinian refugees, expressing concerns about its impact on the country's Jewish majority. Conversely, Palestinians and their supporters argue that the right to return is a matter of justice and should be upheld, allowing Palestinian refugees to go back to their ancestral lands.Side note on this. The 1948 loss of land by the Palestinians is dubbed "the nakba" "the calamity". Israel has banned the use of this word and implements significant force not just in Israel but across the globe to shut down that word (so much for a democratic nation). As it sees it as a threat. I'll let you figure out what that threat is.Beyond all this, there are many Palestinians who are not Muslim, many even are not practicing. The Israeli government undermined the PLO, which wanted a two state solution by helping Hamas ages ago. Because the narrative of a Palestinian government agreeing with a two state solution does not jive with their agenda. A violent extremist faction does because then they can say "look we want peace but they keep attacking just look at their charter". A charter which is explained above doesnt align with Islamic values.At the end of this all. The majority Muslims in Palestine and the majority Jews in Israel want nothing of this. They didn't start this they didn't cause this. But the government of Israel and Hamas hold them all hostage to continue this war.All of this. Has multiple REPUTABLE sources that are easily accessed. The sequence has been documented many times and is very detailed. However it is on you to read and dig deep because both sides do not want you to find the conclusion, that they are colluding they don't care for their people. Which right then and there also provides confirmation that this is not based on religion. Because were it religious, they would know the horrifying punishment that awaits them for the killing of Innocents. And out of fear of it they would quake and never do it again.Also you might think this is more against the Israeli government. Which it is. While hamas is evil and did wrong, people are only reacting to what happened in october. Up until September Israel had already killed 38 Palestinian children. September as in before october. And that is just this year. No uproar about that. They sniped a 9 yr old and headshot a 2 year old.
Hey Witty, you‚Äôre ignorant. Wake the fuck up.
To compare how Jews were generally treated under Christian Europe to how they were generally treated under Muslim rule in the Middle East is a night and day comparison by almost all historical accounts and records, with Jews under Muslim rule having it FAR better overall (hell, some CHRISTIANS had it better under Muslim rather than Christian rule)And yes, Jews and Muslims and Christians lived pretty alright side by side in Ottoman ruled Palestine.  The Jewish people even helped their neighbors hide when Haganah was going door to door rounding them up for execution or expulsion and helped fight against Zionist colonialism.
Yeah. I wasn‚Äôt clear though my bad!
I mean that countries goverment murdered and kidnapped hundreds of people a week ago. They can be.
Why would that be funny?
I mean hamas went door to door killing elderly and children. Murdered people at a music festival and curently.has 200 hostages including American hostages. There have been 6,000 misses from Gaza shot at Israel. Israel has since shit misses and killed kids in gaza. That is what hamas has to do with that....or was that a rhetorical question?
It is a war. This was a polite protest. I am not sure why people are so upset.
Shame on all these idiots
....someone needs to teach you what the first amendment is...I feel like.you have zero idea what youbare talking about.
Hahah
Honestly I know this is polarizing time but this is one of the more polite protests I have seen. Except for that one guy at the end.
The plane crash, you sociopath
He is one of the thieves. It‚Äôs pretty clear

Airboss (air traffic controller at an airshow) went off of the pre-planned/briefed altitudes/routes and threw off the pilots, leading to this.
The issue is mixing **Race** and *Religion*. Palestinians are a race of people who live in Palestine. The land has gone by a bunch of names, and so have they. They have always lived in Palestine. They were not always Muslim, but nearly all of them became muslim during Islamic rule.(Edit: they didn't really have a choice at the time) There are Palestinian Jews and Palestinian Christians. What the UN did(with the help of the British) is say, "This land is now Israel and this Land is Palestine." Then said **European** *Jews* can go take the land marked Israel and settle there. *Non-jewish* Palestinians living in the land marked Israel were kicked out, or killed.(mostly killed, cause the UN was OK with it) Palestinians were not happy about that. The new Israelis (Mostly Europeans) did not agree with how the UN carved up Palestine/Israel, so they took more land. Again kicking out or killing the Palestinians living there. (this time mostly kicked out, cause the UN was not OK with it)That has been going on for 60 years now. There were other conflicts as well, the Palestinians and neighboring Muslim nations definitely did some heinous shit to Israel. They are colonizers and settlers. Many are not even Semitic but just Europeans, Americans even, whose ancestors converted to the *Religion*. Hell some just convert to Judaism and go to Israel and take land.
It is a nation‚Äôs flag on someone‚Äôs property. You don‚Äôt even need to argue the politics.
People don't get that literally 20% of the population of Israel is Muslim, most are Palestinian.
I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs worse, the plane crash, or truck bro taking up two parking spots with his jacked up highway crawler.
I‚Äôm waiting for which one of you‚Äôs going to call them antisemitic‚Ä¶
Hamas blew up the hospital.
The blown up hospital.  No rubble, no crater, just burned up cars.
Well the Jews also put Jesus on a cross so‚Ä¶ I think they are still confused
if you take a look at some interviews it doesn't seem like they are purely unsympathetic to the Palestinians, many of them talk about human rights abuses and such
Your acting like these strategically placed countries asked for war also for an example France helped us fight off the British in the revolutionary War a long time later we liberated them from the nazis it's called an investment having both Israel and Ukraine free is to our advantage people who don't support foreign intervention do not see the big picture nor do they understand history
Why the fuck would you take it down
Bro u have eve try thing to say but nothing to say about countries fighting off their own dimes that‚Äôs why it need to stop if you can‚Äôt afford war don‚Äôt act like u can it‚Äôs that simple how that work paying taxes healthcare and all the other bullshit just so Ukraine and is real  can go to war lol Sh√¨t is a joke and you ever heard the phrase I don‚Äôt care do you know where the us is located why tf is it sticking it‚Äôs nose in other people business
Imagine doing this for an Israeli flag.
Funny enough, if Hamas didn‚Äôt brutally murder and rape their way to the music festival to murder more civilians, there‚Äôd be no call for a cease fire.
Yep. Most Palestinians are terrified and not a fan of Hamas as well
Palestine is not Hamas. This is just Islamophobia
Won't even let them put up a flag in peace.
This needs more publicity on a global scale.
they are just goofy, some are racist as most extremists are, but for the most part just goofy. They have actively helped raise awareness and even support fundraisers for humanitarian efforts to support Palestinians though. Its like the opposite of doing bad with good intention, they do *mostly* good with questionable intentions.
What do you mean? Doesn't the Torah say God banished Jews from Israel and they aren't supposed to return until he commands them to?
B-17 Flying Fortress.
&gt;They want Israel only to be established when the messiah comes,Genuine question: If the current form of Israel is such a bastardisation to them, why are they there?
Insurrection!!! They should all be put in jail for 20 years.
And that's why air shows need to be cancelled
What a group of losers
Not a word?
Im just curious on how this happened ? i feel like he should have had time to react ? doesnt he see the plane coming ?
I mean "peacefully" no more or less than they lived peacefully in Europe. There was no shortage of persecution and pogroms against Jews in the Middle East.
Sorry what did you say liar ? https://vm.tiktok.com/ZGJwY7gHD/
question: Are the NK's actually physically doing anything violent or crazy to fulfill their apocalypse vision, or do they just spout a bunch of goofy nonsense?
My heart breaks every time I see this stuff!
Yeah, yeah I‚Äôve heard the Israeli trope through and through on Reddit for over a week. Frankly I don‚Äôt believe it.Speaking of news, Al Jazeera did an entire second by second breakdown of the footage and presented evidence that it was an air strike. Israel closed the Aljazeera offices today. Some free press.
No worries at all.Hit me with questions.  I will do my best to answer
That's old times?? Have you ever heard the phrase history repeats itself?
Every news coming out of Palestine is heavily regulated by Hamas and should be taken with huge grain of salt (Israel as well for some cases). Remember the hospital that allegedly got bombed to dust by Israel and 500 people died? [All that happened was part of a rocket from a Jihadist group that landed in the parking lot](https://www.france24.com/en/middle-east/20231020-gaza-hospital-blast-was-caused-by-misfired-rocket-says-european-military-source). The building itself was barely damaged and Palestine suddenly never let us know how many did die.
Man that‚Äôs old times we are talking about now I feel like everyone should support themselves and not go to war off other ppls dimes and then act like the us owe them something when it slow up we don‚Äôt pay our taxes to make other countries military better shit it‚Äôs still homeless people and shitty school systems in the us that nobody got the money for but got money for this nonsense
So, criticizing Israel is antisemitic and supporting Palestine is pro-terrorism. Gotcha. I'll write that down.

&gt;northern IrishThey're just called Irish if they support unification.&gt;They are technically BritishNo they aren't due to the Good Friday Agreement.&gt;but would prefer to be IrishThey **are** Irish. This comment is foolish and you should stop spouting nonsense.
Sorry, I really don't need to see this ever again.
I hate that people are so dumb that instead of hearing what you said about supporting hamas not being the same as supporting Palestine. Instead of understanding your logic, they will just make up something on the spot so they can continue on their stupid soap box. These protesters probably use this same logic for tons of things. I hate people like that.
I feel like I see this video every other week on here. Still fucked up though.
This is Iran, not the US. The Islamic dictatorship forces political issues in every aspect of life. People are sick of it.
Why is that weird? Until the stupid Islamic dictatorship occupying Iran came to power, we had friendly relations with Israel. There are many Iranians who emigrated to Israel and Iran is the home of Cyrus the Great, the man who liberated the Jews from Babylonian captivity. There are streets named after him in Israel.
Your comment is a bit confusing. What are you referring to exactly?
Haredi Jews. They are not necessarily pro Palestine but more anti isreal. They use the Palestinian flag to troll the IDF
I thought I somewhat understood this conflict. I don‚Äôt on any level.
I appreciate your answer, I want more understanding.
These dudes are ashkenazi and speaking Yiddish - they never existed along side Arabs at that time. They were in europe by the time Arabs colonized the levant.

hahah..yeah Trump loves Russia like Isreal bombed the hospital and killed 500 people.. The leftist media turn idiots into complete morons..
They are anti-Israel for selfish fringe religious reasons, not cause they care about Palestinians.
I pray God intervene speedily
It is Iran that fuels Hezbollah and Hamas, both supremacist organisations that want to wipe all Jews from the earth, not just Israel. But it is also Iran that terrorises its own people that murders thousands that dare raise their voice. We in the west have this age old discussion if head covering is a choice in Iran women have lost their life for not covering. Jews and Muslims can live side by side, they actually do relatively speaking but especially in Israel itself. But the hope of peaceful coexistence won‚Äôt ever be achieved unless tough action is taken but some still seem to have the discussion blindly, just ask you atypical Iranian and you may start getting it.
Not really ‚Äúlet‚Äù
Bless you those of you who actually follow the teachings of Judaism and are not Zionist who have bastardized the religion because of power and greed.
Wow really violent demonstration, compared to all the peaceful Palestinian demonstrations (not)

Is being an air show pilot the most dangerous job in America?
All over the country many predominantly Jewish or Muslim neighborhoods are sought out to move into by members of the opposite religion because the two share so many cultural aspects that they live in harmony.  ESPECIALLY in NYC in many parts of Queens and BrooklynThe issue is that piece of land in the Middle East and how the media has portrayed to the masses that this isn‚Äôt a war over land in the Middle East, but rather a war between every Muslim and every Jewish person. You sound like you‚Äôre getting your info from FOX News.
Actually it is $14 Billion of Military weapons...on top of the yearly $5 Billion that Isreal gets every year from USA taxpayers.... free Military weapons... because the US taxpayers are slaves of Isreal...give me Break...USA is indirectly committing war crimes in Gaza via Isreal...we should be proud...because each and every dead or injured man woman and child in Gaza since October 7th was and is an animal....
We are in the weirdest timeline...
You have managed to explain absolutely nothing. Isreal is the most racist country in the world  lead by a Jewish population. Hamas is a terrorist organization that has been put in power by the weak Palestine people‚Äôs refusal to stand up, much like the weak afghan population refuses to stand against the Taliban even after given every opportunity. No single post can go into the depths of history that have lead the two  to this point. If there‚Äôs one take away from all of this it should be more support for Ukrainian people. There willingness to fight for there freedom when attacked for nothing more than an authoritarian leaders power trip makes Them the true victims In all of this. The support for the Ukrainian people will now be strained while the US is spread between helping them and supporting there partner In what is Essentially a race war. The Jews and Palestine people are both wrong but that‚Äôs what happens when you allow religion to dictate law.
Farrrkkk, how many layers is there to this madness.
America the land of free sp.....oh that's right. It's only if you agree with me
Maybe Hamas shouldn't start a war then.
Was this in the Forest Hills/Kew Gardens area? Looks like it to me, but it's a generic apartment building so idk.Regardless, Queens is the most ethnically diverse place in the *country*, so this might be the apartment of an actual Palestinian that had this flag up long before October 7th. Also chanting "no Hamas" about someone with the *Palestinian* flag in their window when Hamas has their own damn flag. Clowns.
what about the 13 massacres? bet those people that died had kids that are traumatized after that.
Yeah they went into Israel to ask for bananas.
Biggest Ally in the region. Anything to Israel.
This sentiment is a great way to describe it, it's also mostly the same for Scots that want independence from Britain. Technically British, but only want to be Scottish.** doesn't apply to every Scottish person.
well i hope you dont forget the part where hamas fired rockets into isreal and massacred 270 civillians
do you ever stop talking like tbh at this point you are literally speaking to nobody  Calling someone a white supremacist and racist over a comment that was completely unrelated is the most brain dead shit I've seen this year
FUCK YESSSSS LET'S GOOOOOOO!!!!! This makes me so insanely happy.
If the United states didn't involve itself in foreign affairs we would either be speaking Chinese German or Russian if it wasn't in our best interest we wouldn't be doing it
Comment days later but I think it was a mistake. The victims of the attack deserve to not have videos of their/families deaths spread around, but now all people see is palastine being bombed. Hamas is making one hell of a crocodile tears show out of it.
Ah right. Went over my head then :)
remember that these people probably drive, have kids, and "contribute" to society
That old chestnut?
Queens is MAGA country
That‚Äôs just someone‚Äôs flag in their window? Not at a public space, a government office or at a place of business? Lames, all of em.
Everything aside THIS is a terrifying display of mob mentality
What‚Äôs next, this?https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristallnacht
Palestine is not Hamas. People really need to stop conflating the two
And Israelis do that daily to Palestinians and it‚Äôs state sanctioned. I just read about a little boy being shot in the back by an Israeli settler. He was an unarmed little kid just walking. To me that‚Äôs a brutal murder and it happens every single day in land that‚Äôs not Israel.
I think it has a lot to do with all of the pro isreal propaganda that evangelical churches have put out for decades. They want Isreal to be an ethno state of only Jewish people to bring on the rapture and the end of the world. It sounds whacky, but I shit you not. It's worth the Google. Weird shit man weird shit. It's wild like something like 60% of people that identify as  Christians  believe that the formation of Isreal in 1948 was the fulfillment of biblical prophecy.
Iranians are tired of the sanctions they suffer because Iran wages war abroad via Hezbollah, such as against Israel. Plus, it won't give up on its dream of a nuclear weapon. The people are tired of living under a theocracy that represses them with violence and public hangings- they are fighting back. Iranian parks are full of unemployed men hanging out during the day.
Jews for Palestinians in Israel..,ya don‚Äôt say???
Beautifully said
This is actually a great point. If there seems like no good responces, then being neutral is the positive choice. I would imagine that holding truth on a deeper esoteric level, but in this situation I think there was a better option. Criticize the hell out of this, but I imagine if Israel had said wow we may have brought some of this on ourselves, let's go send in people to give them food, clothing, medical aid, and to speak with local leaders. Working at the purely local level, building rapport and building a larger and larger connection of ethos with Palestinians over time. That means slowly removing things like the blockade wall and allowing Palestinains to enter society in various social jobs. They are more powerful united than seperated.
Public sentiment can be very effective at changing policy. It‚Äôs happened before.
There's nothing anywhere to indicate that this happened, so unless you have a source you can't really make this claim
Kind of impressive for someone to be ignorant of something for around 30 years, and to be so proud about it.
I like how these options directly reflect the 3 I mentioned. I'd obviously support the third, because like you said getting to a place of mutual understanding on both sides is preventing my third option of do something positive in the face of evil.  It is wise but impractical without mediation at this point.
Innocent women and children who have nothing to do with Hamas are being slaughtered. And this is how you frame the situation. You‚Äôre pretty detached from reality.
Iranian people stand with Israel
Actually, the smaller plane got fucked up when it had just previously collided with a drone operating without airshow consent or guidance iirc
Pretty sure that group doesn't believe Israel should be a thing because their Messiah hasn't risen yet...?
Oh you're stuck huh?
Bingo
I was anticipating a response like this, thank you for being respectful in that exchange. I've read over and given a lot of thought to your comment here. I want to reassure you so many people have been turned off from Israel since seeing the carnage they wrought in Gaza. It's truly the opposite of a war which would sell to the US.  Also you could argue the first point of the UN was the decision of wether it would resemble a collective world government or not. This was in direct response to WW2 and John F Kennedy was a big fan. I disagree with the notion of a religious run state, apartheid. Religion should influence social reconstruction and help spiritualize the individual citizen. But the realm of religion and spirit is neither a social or economic order,  it is a "spiritual" identity of God-knowing individuals. This creates social phenomenon, with astounding political and economic repercussions. Religion at the state level cannot fully benefit from criticism and thus self-correct.This is difficult to hear, but I tell you this; there is perfection in everything. Strive to see the perfection. This is the change of consciousness of which I speak of in option 3.Say yes to what shows up. Feel your feelings. Cry your cries. Laugh your laughs. Honor your truth. Yet when all the emotion is done, be still and know that God is there.In other words, in the midst of the greatest tragedy, see the glory of the process. Even as you die with a bullet through your chest. In a moment of great tragedy, the challenge always is to quiet the mind and move deep within the soul. You automatically do this when you have no control over it. In cases where people face life and death moments, often they report that time slowed way down, that they were overcome by a curious calm, that there was no fear at all.‚ÄúFear not, for I am with you.‚Äù That is what poetry has to say to the person facing tragedy. "In your darkest hour, I will be your light. In your blackest moment, I will be your consolation. In your most difficult and trying time, I will be your strength. Therefore, have faith! For I am your shepherd; you shall not want I will cause you to lie down in green pastures; I will lead you beside still waters. I will restore your soul, and lead you in the paths of righteousness for My Name‚Äôs sake.And yea, though you walk through the valley of the Shadow of Death, you will fear no evil; for I am with you. My rod and My staff will comfort you. I am preparing a table before you in the presence of your enemies. I shall anoint your head with oil. Your cup will run over.Surely, goodness and mercy will follow you all the days of your life, and you will dwell in My house‚Äîand in My heart‚Äî forever."
Yup. Cover the camera terrorists.

Watch this debate. https://youtu.be/2bA6Iif8-cY?si=GBPqnA__aeJPZdOO I think they paint a pretty good picture of why this occurred while both speakers argue for both sides. Isreal is an apartheid state maintained by military control
So another repost.
It may not be a war of religions, but it's certainly a war started because of religion. Nobody needed to die.
It‚Äôs not a simple yes or no.
Is she American? What‚Äôs her name?
It's like everyone's crazy, racist uncle got on tiktok for news.
If you throw fireworks onto train tracks, yes, it's grounds to forcefully remove you from the premises.
Sounds like you are drinking the reverse Kool-Aid that the OP was drinking. Can't we see both sides are at fault and commit war crimes regularly? I'm starting to think we should just let them go at it and have the west stay out. Lets see if Israel can take on the entire middle east since they have been pissing them off for 75 years. Whoever wins wins. So be it. God be with them all bc humanity has left them.
It's the Iranian pro league. Most of one side was actually filled. Here is another angle: https://x.com/iranintl_en/status/1715449756577562891?s=46&amp;t=ygPmsASN-ME3MPHjn08BFw
Option 2 and three are the same. These people are fighting a war by launching rockets out of churches, hospitals, schools while they hide in underground tunnels? How do you fight a war with them. Then when you fire at their launch sites they try to run a PR smear campaign telling the world you‚Äôre killing children. Who believes that garbage???Do you 1 fire back?2 do nothing?3‚Ä¶what? Ask them to stop?
798 ‚Äúincidents‚Äù. Sounds like taunting the lion and the lion finally bites back.

Dude no one feared him. All this is just the consequence of his idiot policies.
Yeah, I keep saying it everytime they bring it up.  The the ultra orthodox jews protesting Isreal aren't sympathetic to the Palestinians, and they aren't making a principled stand in the way we think about it.  They just want *their* version of the apocalypse to play out.
You're pig ignorant and we are tired of your neurotic behaviour
[wiki](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Dallas_airshow_mid-air_collision)
And so you should be on some sort of list because most terrorists actually look like you !
What ? Maybe ..... no stop it you ARE a white supremist and a racist. Not maybe you are and wear it with pride sir so when we decide to clean up we know where to go. I'm literally a social worker so project all you want. You are a bad person ! White colonisers will not prevail not in the modern day. You will pay!
Fool ü§£
ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è they killed Israeli children. Seems like repayment
You see the Jewish children in cages held by hamas as they laugh in joy?
Even that is too generous! All the hostages and then they can have minimum relief. Every hostage dead is another day of bombing.
Hahaha all of the people jumping to praise these Ultra Orthodox wouldn't be so admiring if they heard what they think about women. And gays. And Christians. And nonobservant Jews. And trans people. They are anti-zionist because they want a theocracy, and only once their messiah comes. Their problem is with liberalism and democracy, not any occupation. They couldn't care less about Palestinians.
This is such a polarizing topic, as a sports organization they should just do their job and play the sport and stay out of anything political.
god they all seem so fucking stupid saying "no hamas"

I remember this, that was a WW2-era bomber at a show
You can't do a terror attacks and fill your military targets with civilians and think you won't get bombed
Yeah and maybe you're a pedophile that's just naturally  attracted to videos of crying children. That's a lot of brainless conjecture and your accusations of bigotry and gaslighting coming from someone like YOU are so absurd as to be almost comical. The only certainty between the two of us is that you are without question or shame a terrorist sympathizer. I now wash my hands of you before I find myself on the no-fly list just for conversing with you.GOOD DAY, SIR!(I just slammed the door dramatically)
Wow. This is a historic video. This might be one that is in the future version of history books.
The only thing I'm spinning is around to come back and tell you how stupid that original comment was. Mf npc
Yeah you making requested to torture this kid while saying torture is bad. You're slow !!!! Hahaha
The rest goes to water piping for civilians then that goes to hamas
We need more of this. If the majoroty of Jewish people stand up to their own government, we can stop this genocidal regime.
These people are lunatics and need to get some help.
Freedom loving Americans right here.
I have limited knowledge BUT always seek the truth. It is my understanding that Hamas are a terrorist organization that was formed initially as an armed resistance against Isreali occupation. Which, law allows occupied people's to defend themselves against their occupiers. What happened that made their resistance group to be labeled as a terrorist organization? Why? (Genuine question, not saying they aren't terrorists I just mean how did they go from resistance group to terrorists)Isreal has been terrorizing Palestinians for DECADES. Just look at all the children injured/dead in Gaza right now. It is absolutely gut wrenching.. I can barely watch the videos coming out of Gaza. Furthermore, there are plenty of videos going back many years that show Isrealis terrorizing Palestinains.. Just watch video footage from their Freedom March in I think 2018(?)Now, the Oct 7 attack was not defending themselves, that was an offensive attack that killed many civilians and was horrific. But think about it objectively. They aren't doing anything Isreal has not done for decades.  Why is one a terrorist group and the other "just defending themselves". And before people jump down my throat and call me anti-semitic or a terrorist sympathizer, I am not saying what Hamas did on Oct 7th was okay. I am not saying they are not terrorists.  Any loss of civilian life is unacceptable, I am just trying to have an intellectual dialog to understand the situation better. Let's try to avoid using buzz words or assume something about each other. I just want to have an INTELLIGENT, nuanced conversation about this. Make it make sense.
‚ÄúTake it off‚Äù- Andrew WK
Racism, Sexism, Homophobia, Transphobia, Harassment, Race Baiting, Bigotry, etc. (Racist/bigoted people freaking out in videos are allowed, but being a racist in the comments section will result in a ban.)
Why give a dime to Israel they in the same boat let‚Äôs not act stupid
I can think of better things to do with my evening
This kind of harassment was used in the Holocaust, how can this people not see
"This isn't a d.j. booth".....Well your spinning sumthin!
How does my comment give any indication whatsoever as to my understanding of the conflict? I'd just stay offline. You stopped sounding coherent way before this
1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jewish_secularism2: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_Zionism
Ah.. this fool
You're right and wrong. They don't believe they can't return to the holy land, they only believe a jewish state can be returned only when the Messiah returns. But they can still return to the land and live there if they wished for (as many lived under Ottomans).
you can learn more about Jews against Zionism in Twitter where there some of them speaking up  [@TorahJudaism](https://twitter.com/TorahJudaism)
How blind, ignorant and dumb do u actual have to be?Israel:Protects its citizens, i.e. iron dome from Hamas missiles - have u seen an IDF battalion hiding in a village and firing rocket from living rooms?Hits targets where Hamas has a base, ammunition storage - so THE TARGET IS HAMASOften warns ppl inside the house by roof knocking (not always)Hamas:Hamas hides in between it's own civilians, in the same house - Hamas doesn't care if the house gets bombed THEY DONT CARE ABOUT THE KIDS IN THIS PICTURE - because if they did, they would hide in a military base and not inside a house with civilians - THATS THE DIFFERENCEHamas targets primarily civilians, they recorded the killing spree on camera, are u blind? - they shoot civilians, kids and burned them alive - none if those Hamas "soldiers" was looking for an IDF soldier to have a fightHas anyone if those kids been killed face to face from an IDF soldier? - NO, they are collateral because Hamas is a fucking coward hiding in civilian houses - TAHTS THE PROBLEM, THEY DONT CAREJust because ur ppl suffer more at the moment doesn't put u in the right - in WW2 more Germans died than allies and yet Germany was the bad guy - the loss of life doesn't determine who is wrong or who is right
People need to know the difference between Hamas and Palestine.
I‚Äôm just tired of hate. Can‚Äôt we all just get along?
Should be and don't call people a dunce when you're  advocating dropping lethal munitions on people. You are a colonisers and a complete idiot for doing anything that causes conflict in the modern day. Shame on you backwards racist üòí you been watching too much history Channel now you think you're all war hero's.
Duh‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what Hamas did dumb fuck.
Did he shout out u can't park there mate
They literally have nothing better to do with their lives
Zionists are the most evil force on earth
That guy seems like a legitimately good dude. After he pulls, everyone actually holds him back but he‚Äôs not barking. Just puts his hands up like ‚Äúunderstood, that‚Äôs why I didn‚Äôt hit him‚Äù
Poor guy, why do we let them get away with using innocents a human shields?!? Radical Islam ideology needs to be eradicated.
But they left the land and thus had no claim to it. To come back this long after is like Europeans coming back to Africa ü§£. Nah mate you caused hella drama and displacement of the people there. This makes you a occupying force and a legitimate target for resistance fighters.
Dude how are you this late to the party ü•≥ hamas was created and funded by isreal. They needed someone to fight plus they rejected peace talks. Isreal is a colonising army and you are on their side purely because you're white ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
I love these guys. I always enjoy watching them humiliate the IOF.
Unfortunately I can't send pictures here I'll send you in private
Zionist gangs made this situation not Hamas‚Ä¶
The white people on here are broken ü§£ openly racist and bias
Or maybe you're a white supremist and a zionist üòÄ maybe you just came here to show your lack of humanity ? Maybe you just go around gaslighting people and thinking you're edgy ? Maybe you're just a bad person or very young.
Hate to burst your propaganda bubble, but I spent 5 years of my life working for the coroners office, picking up dead bodies. Those images are undeniably real. You may get some people to question it, but there are many of us who aren‚Äôt so easy to lie to
This isn't a dj booth, plus what kind of sick person does what you're saying to a child just to prove some irrelevant point ?. You have serious issue buddy that you see this and still can't comprehended the situation. What a disgusting mess you are that you put such evil on an innocent child. You would deliberately torture kids and you just admitted it. You have no humanity!
The colonizers are bullying them in the west too. I bet they want to instinctively kick them out of their house and say Palestine isn't a real place
Sounds like one of those click bait adds OP.This sub is a joke for content.
The pictures of burned children are not real made with AI!
W was right.  Axis of evil.  Iran +Russia + China (and N. Korea too) = pure evil
Palestinian terrorists brutally murdered hundreds of innocent people only because they were Jewish. I wonder who the real nazis are?
It's Jews holding Palestinian flags and yelling at the IOF. You really need someone to caption it?
Uninformed.
There is a difference in protesting vs killing Innocents.The last election was 2006.They do not represent Palestinians in the sense that Palestinians do not support the killing of people at a music concert or babies.Support is not absolute and can definitely tank if someone does something scummy.Not to mention most of the people in Gaza alive today are just kids. They weren't even born when Hamas came to power in that electric 27 years ago.
The reason is to justify genocide. Make people think Hamas = Palestine and it's a lot easier to kill 1000 children.
You can condemn both?
The sad part of this video is that mainstream Zionist media won't ever show this on their broadcast.
Imagine asking such a dumb ass question while having access to the Internet.
There's a lil thing called the first amendment
Really? It wasn‚Äôt the decades of brutal occupation of their land that lead to this? You can‚Äôt oppress people for decades and think they wont rise up one day
I just want everyone to know that these ultra orthodox jews are only anti-israel because they believe israel cant exist until the messiah returns. In essence this has little to nothing to do about the oppression of Palestinians and everything to do with religious doctrine.Ultra Orthodox Jews can be unbelievable cruel to women and minorities just because they appear to "agree" with popular sentiment doesnt mean we should be supporting them.
&gt;Some Ultra Orthodox Jews are antizionist because they believe the Messiah must take the land of Israel, destroy the dome of the rock, and build the 3rd temple.So it *is* a war of religions, then.
If there are any Americans or Canadians advocating for Palestine on this sub you should leave. First Nations and Native American people have been treated as less than equals for centuries now, where is your outrage for them, the people forced to move onto what was considered undesirable land, they are still there, if you are concerned about Palestinians but silent on Native Americans you are just being a hypocrite of the highest order.
You‚Äôre anti immigration to. Wow you fit all the criteria for a maga cult member
You trump fans will use any logic you can to justify your nazi leader
You trump supporters still believe this? You‚Äôre ridiculous
You're basically watching what the Europeans did to Native Americans hundreds of years ago, but its happening now in another country.
&gt;and now that they have retaliatedI keep seeing people say Hamas doesn't represent Palestinians.  So which is it, because it's confusing.
They're palestinian Jews
I‚Äôll wave a Palestinian flag AND chant no Hamas, these things are not mutually exclusive
That‚Äôs a weak protest‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs 100 million in every major city around the world protesting against Israel‚Äôs genocide. You notice they‚Äôre only out at night. Because in the day time there‚Äôs too many pro Palestinian people so they‚Äôd get their arse kicked.
I would not put it past Iran/Hamas to have done this themselves to garner the same sympathy that Israel received after posting the images this week of the babies that were burned alive. Hamas are terrorists. They have murdered many Palestinian adults &amp; children before. They rule by fear &amp; terror. Russia uses this same tactic in Ukraine, trying to distort the public‚Äôs perceptions.
It makes sense when you realize these people don‚Äôt want Palestinians or Palestine to exist
When one side is raping and torturing and the other is murdering children you can condemn the actions of both.
Stating facts doesn‚Äôt make one antisemitic. Zionism in itself is anti-Semitic. Zionists are the ones that are bombing the shit out of Semitic people in Gaza right now.
Isn‚Äôt this the same group that doesn‚Äôt believe in the holocaust or that it was a blessing?
fighter pilot sealed all their doom.   hard to see anything below you if you‚Äôre meant to be in formation yet higher and banking
Isnt zionism about creating a jewish homeland? Why would athiests be heading that?
I never said they aren‚Äôt radical anti-Zionists.  They are.I never said that they don‚Äôt work with Israel‚Äôs enemies either.  They do.I said that their support of Palestinians isn‚Äôt only fueled by their anti-Zionism, but by the Torah command to stand up to oppression of others and to help those in need.If you have any doubts, they always message back on Twitter (@TorahJudaism), where you can confirm what I am saying.
All on Hamas, they created this situation.
What do you mean?
There's probably 3 or 4 people present who are even remotely affected or have ever set foot in Israel/Palestine. It's just dumb asses fueled by the side of propaganda they chose to support. As far as these people know the tenants innocent little cousin was just bombed and they dont support Hammas. We've gone from trigger words to trigger flags.
This isn't an angry mob trying to disrupt the democratic process of certifying an election. There are some pretty stark differences.
Why would athiests care about cohabitation with other religions?
All these comments are very interesting &amp; helpful, a documentary explaining all the different sects &amp; teachings would be nice.
Let's not fall into antisemitism by talking about true and false Jewish people. Let's talk instead about the bravery of these Jewish people against a state that disagrees so fundamentally with them. The bravery to stand up to them. That's some real shit right there.
I‚Äôd be blasting MC Abdul on repeat.
This is on Hamas using human shield
The link you posted confirms exactly what I said. Even someone (the interviewee) who is clearly their proponent tried to refer to it as a myth, but then went on in several paragraph thereafter to confirm it is not a myth. She outright says that they are radical anti-zionists, in fact, so radical they don't just oppose the state of israel in theory, but actively work with Israel's opponents and enemies to bring that to fruition.
Honestly I wouldve put some noise canceling headphones, pop some melatonin and let them chant all night. These old geezers couldn‚Äôt stand there for more than a couple hours.
Why the fuck people are so certain Israel is the good guy? Are people so fucking stupid like that? Its not about a simply black and white situation, people need to grow the fuck up
99mil of the 100mil goes to hamas probably
We are all living on the corpse that was once America.
80% of Jews support israel. zionism = support for a jewish state, aka israel. people use the term zionist to make antisemitism more palatable.
Palestinians are a Semitic people. Just saying
Except that the Jews who have had family there for forever have always defended the Palestinians against the Zionists, even hiding them in their homes as Haganah went door to door trying to round them up.This is a mitzvah for them.  It isn‚Äôt just an opportunity to get back at the state.  They have a religious obligation to the Palestinians.  The idea that they are just doing it to be anti-Zionist is a [myth](https://mondoweiss.net/2018/12/solidarity-palestinians-documentary/)
Thanks! yes I just looked up the Neturei Karta in an interview with some of their rabbis. They seem to distinguish between judaism and zionism, where zionism (and ockupation) isnt a jewish principle according to them.. Will keep on reading,

I see a lot of clout chasing douche bags ü•∏
Never again means never again, for everyone
It seems you badly watched. It explains the details.
They aren‚Äôt moving to the state they are moving to the land, because that is a mitzvah.  Very religious Jews that could, have ALWAYS tried to move there, or at least visit, no matter who was in charge, be it Christians, Muslims, or now Zionists.  Didn‚Äôt mean that they supported the Crusaders or the Ottoman Empire, or whoever.  The land is totally different than the state.  There is a distinction between the two.Biblically speaking, they were given the land long long before they had a national state (which started with King Saul)‚Ä¶which God tried to talk them out of, saying that it would only bring trouble.    But they insisted.  Before that, they were just a federation of tribes that descended from the same patriarch (Abraham) based on the promises made to their matriarch (Sarah).Having a Jewish state is currently against God‚Äôs will, which is why the religious Jews never tried to have one, despite everyone else gaining nationalist fervor in the 18-1900‚Äôs.
LAME LETS GO ISREAL bomb the terrorists Palestinians
Martyrs? More like pawns to be sacrificed for in a vain attempt to get public sympathy
you're worried about punctuation as if that negates what Islamic Jihad did to their own people.   #Priorities   Congrats on being so bright with regard to punctuation but fully idiotic on all things actually important you oaf.
what lies?  Hamassholes build rockets out of street lights and plumbing .... and you think they are ACCURATE you clueless oaf?
I doubt you see much in whatever blind-hatred you spew.  To defend Hamassholes is just wrong AND stupid so congrats on both I guess.
This is a pretty good video that goes inside the Hasidic neighborhoods in Jerusalem who are staunchly anti Zionist and anti Israel. They are pro Palestinian state rights. Hasidic Jews believe Israel should not exist until the messiah comes. It‚Äôs against orthodox beliefs, and an abomination to the Talmud‚Äôs teachings. https://youtu.be/riPujSoqkQA?si=-e1QFJoOOoWJ-g8e
it is what I know.      Perhaps you do not have NEWS or information where you live.  Not sure.     Happy to inform you though....
Contrary to popular myth, not all Jewish people hate Palestinians and not all Palestinian people hate Jews.
Netanyahu is using the hostages for his own political ends.
They finally calling that organization what they are.IDF bad
I'd ask Islamic Jihad to stop firing rockets that are home-made primitive and dangerous to Gaza perhaps.
why give a  DIME to Gaza...?!?
Yes I totally agree, what Israel does in the name of Jews is just political, like I suspected, and can have huge implications if this were to escalate even further. üßê
My jaw dropsüòÖ this is not really reported in main stream media, I always assumed they were "Zionists"
Judaism isn‚Äôt patrilineal.  Jewishness is always figured through the maternal line, and converts are to be treated the same as anyone born Jewish.The only times Judaism really uses the paternal line are in the case of Priestly lineage to serve in the Temple (have to come from Aaron), or Kingly lineage (have to come from David)&gt; kick you outNo.  Just can‚Äôt own land if you‚Äôre not part of one of the twelve tribes, and they aren‚Äôt allowed to permanently sell that land to anyone, even if they are from another of the 12 tribes.When the Messiah comes, their prophecies state that the land will be the home of many peoples and there will be no more states or nations, and everyone will be welcome in the temple (which is not how it was before), and the Messiah will teach everyone, even non-Jews.
Wtttffff
The community pre-exists Israel.
Their position can better be explained by "the enemy of their enemy is my friend" rather that your elaborate jumping through hoops. They are against the creation of a State of Israel period, because the meschiah has not yet come. Whether this is in the historical land of the Jews or on some empty island donated to the Jewish people by some billionaire. Them taking on the Palestinian cause is just a means to an end; I would not ascribe any moral motivations to it.
Info about this?
Canadian here, we know what having a shit stain for a leader is....But both option, in the case of americans are not better. Trump wouldnt have changed anything if not made things worst. Maybe you'd have a 3rd conflict atm instead of 2. I'm not saying Biden is a strong figurehead and inspires trust worldwide, not at all. But if those are the 2 options given, well, thats where we are.As for Trudeau, i'm just thankfull he STFU atm, this way we dont look like morons on the world stage this time.
Wow. I‚Äôve been seeing more of the opposite online with asshole college kids ripping down posters of missing/kidnapped Israeli kids
Where? When?
Interesting, so why would they live in Israel? Are they for a political solution that integrates Palestinians to a huge Israel? They seem so open about their opposition and spite. I assume they are the ones who Don't send their children to the militaryEdit; just read through the repliesüôÉ but feel free to comment
That's fucking terrible.
Option 3 only sounds wise if your kid hasnt been burned alive, shot in the street or blown to pieces.It's all easy saying these things until you have to water down your own feelings of hatred.To begin with, there is no love between these 2 groups and that was before the conflict. The sucker punch the Hamas inflicted on Israel only allowed Israel the justification of self defense to shit all over Gaza. But make no mistake, they've been wanting to do so for years. Now take into consideration that on day 1 attrocities were commited against the people of Israel and you have the perfect recipe for an easely sold war to the public.On the other hand, the creation of Israel is th UN's biggest mistake (also worth noting it's the first decision they made...)The people from Gaza had their lands stolen. Are left to fend for themselves in minimal conditions and, to top it off, are dependent on the infrastructures of Israel to survive. So searching for some goodness through the evil here is pretty bleak.
&gt; not necessarily pro-PalestinianAs they wave Palestinian flags and take it on the chin for their beliefs.  Okay üëåüèª A Torah command is to treat your neighbor like yourself, and any non-idolatrous non-Jews in the land are to be treated like they are brothers, with fairness, kindness, justice, mercy, compassion, etc just like they would to their own family.So it isn‚Äôt just the state that they‚Äôre against, it is the mistreatment of others as well.&gt; try and find other reasonsThere is no other reasons, accept religious.  They are constantly at odds with the state over EVERYTHING.  For example, they refuse to be forced to join the IDF because it is the state and because God says that He is Israel‚Äôs protector.  They also have views that aren‚Äôt so great, like trying to force gender separation on all city buses and such (city buses that go through the area are gender segregated).  They are very active outside of the Palestine situation.&gt; driven by Talmudic teachings, not righteousness or justiceThe Talmud is just explanation and discussion of how to live out Torah.  And Torah is, by what their prophets say, righteous and just.  So to them, they ARE driven by righteousness and justness.
*Dumb* angry bigots
Ummmm, That's the Palestinian flag, not the Hamas flag. People cannot be that dumb.Also, thankful I moved out of Queens. NYC all together, actually.
Also, before hamas were empowered in the late 90s, every Palestinian resistance group was secularist
Yet many of them immigrate to Israel. If they are against Zionism, why do they engage in it?
Just you're Jewish doesn't mean you get to violate someone else's 1st amendment rights... This is America not Israel.
100%. They really are the new Nazi‚Äôs and don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know that word gets banded around liberally these days but it really is the best word for describing what Zionism is today
Some noise canceling headphones oughta do the trick
Rockets aren‚Äôt deflected by the iron dome. The iron dome shoots a missile up at the rockets and it explodes on them. Destroying both Hamas rocket and iron dome rocket.   Only thing hamas  an control is what direction and how far their rockets can fly. Where they land they land basically .   No clue where you‚Äôd get this information. But if Israel didn‚Äôt have the iron come there would be a lot more death and destruction. Though they have a lot of bomb shelters in Israel and in the Kibbutz‚Äôs . If you are thinking about what happened at that hospital in Gaza. Hamas launched rockets one malfunctioned , which happens especially with the primitive rockets they have. It then landed in the parking lot near the hospital. This happened as the iron dome was launching and destroying the other rockets from that barrage .

Well bombs are more expensive then bandages ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You can hate Hamas and hate the IDF at the same time.  You can also be both and not be an anti-semite.
Sadly they probably feared of being killed over it.  Just one of the mob members would do something, and the crowd would follow.
Well, often flying an Israeli flag is in support of the Israeli government, which is committing an ethnic cleansing. Flying a Palestinian flag is generally closer to saying ‚Äúfree Palestine‚Äù which is not equivalent

This is absolutely, without a shadow of a doubt, a war of religions.
‚Ä¶folks in that crowd could make a lowly policeman lose his job, or promotion, over something like that.
Zionists = Nazis same difference
It was controlled by the ottomans and peaceful for all 3Religions for like 600 years . It hasn‚Äôt gotten better in anyway since y‚Äôall ‚Äúcame back‚Äù allegedly
What about in a dense civilian population ? The zionists are strong ; but God is on our side . Pray for all who love Jerusalem .
It's because most people don't bother to actually find out that not everyone in Palestine is part of Hamas. Them thinking that is the same as someone in the UK thinking that everyone in the US is a part of the KKK.
Not a HAMAS flag tho
And install some remote control water sprinklers that spray sewage water
Freedom of speech doesn't count if it compromises someone elses freedom of speech.
Imagine hitting a beehive and crying after when you get stinged ....
crowd believes the Palestinian flag is the Hamas flag
It‚Äôs hilarious to me that police forces all over the world just never ditched the cavalry charge. I mean why not when riot skirmishes are essentially medieval-style battles without (usually) the killing.
They know that... they just don't want other people to know that.  There's an active campaign to associate all Palestinians with Hamas.
We have the same issue in the US.  Rightwingers are fucking unhinged as well, and the VAST majority of people in the US are sane, it's just that the extreme ones get elected.
So I never really asked him, but he did like pink but usually he would wear it I think because girls would comment on the color, and he was a very good looking guy that was absolutely shredded.  So it would usually be he was talking to a girl and that would piss guys off and they‚Äôd say something to him because he was shorter, and wearing the pink and he then would wreck their world.  So his intentions I think we‚Äôre for picking up ladies, but deep down he liked to rumble too.  So I think it went both ways in his mind he got attention from women, and he got a chance to fight.  Unfortunately it ruined his life.  He was in the army and got discharged for getting arrested for the fighting, he also got felony charges because he hit a deputy that came to break up the fight, the dep got in between him and another guy and he didn‚Äôt realize it was a dep and he laid the officer out.  I stopped talking/hanging with him waaaaay before this.  Going out with a guy that gets into fights all the time wasn‚Äôt my thing.  I since moved states, but I heard he works as an after hours janitor someplace, and he was a top of his class kind of guy in high school.
Both can be true right? They‚Äôre definitely whacky and have extreme beliefs, and also don‚Äôt support the treatment of Palestinians.
People are weird as fuck.
ok, few pointers here. This is very badly explained.Israel gets millitary aid and Gaza gets humanitarian aid.It's not the same price tag. This is all stuff you can find for yourself with minimal research.
How do you imagine the government they're protesting for would handle such protests, especially if it's in support of the US or Israel?
Is this Mea Sharim? (Sorry of I butchered the name) Lots of hasidic? Ashkenazi? Jews who recognizes Palestine alongside Muslims live there. I watched a video by a youtuber named The Salukie.
Yes, lol
The name does not matter what matters is that they're was native citizens living there but isreal came and decided it was their land and kills as many people as they want
What absolute wankers. Fucking losers honestly.
Exactly.
If I were the one putting up the flag, I'd put up a sign next to it saying Fuck Hamas side by side along with an American flag.Those people would be so confused.
you are the most positive comment i have seen yet thx for understanding the case
I mean, they *are* very strange in their own ways too. These are the folks trying to do things like force gender segregation in public transportation because it's against their weird ass religious beliefs. They aren't against Israel here because of some human rights concerns, it's solely about their extreme religious beliefs which considers the modern state of Israel to be blasphemous
I hope they put it back up with an additional ‚Äúfuck Zionism‚Äù sign below
They also meet with Hezbollah, Hamas, and Iran. And they attend Holocaust denial/revisionist conferences along with such distinguished speakers like David Duke.
Honesty good call taking it down. Not worth getting firebombed over a flag. Put it back up tomorrow.
Right because we always take political commentary from our most fundamentalist wackos. mind you those on the Palestinian side also rape and murder/torture so I'm stuck with the lesser evil.
Hamas will be wiped from this earth clean
There are a lot of Jewish people in NYC. That might have something to do with it.
I don't think they have the ability to aim their rockets.  Its probably just "fire and hope it hits something"
This says the one who does not know the history himself. It is sad to read your stuff and know that you are lying and spreading a lot of anti-Semitism. I really hope that you are not serious. Otherwise I'm sorry to say that you are a damn Hamas supporter. A Jew hater who denies the history of Israel. What is wrong in your sick head. What kind of propaganda did you get to tell so much dirt. Why do you support Hamas? Why do you want to keep spreading terror? Why do you think it is good that civilians from Israel are slaughtered? Explain this to us little Jew hater. Just lies and Hamas propaganda. You are an animal just like Hamas.Let's meet in Israel. They will be happy if you come little terrorist.
Both sides are fucked in their own ways.Palestine voted hamas in for control in gaza, and hamas put weapons infrastructure in populated areas. There for most palestinians support hamas. Your statement could be said for the opposite side too, the concert people and the children and families of  israeli living across the borders didn't matter?
ham sandwiches and shrimp.
Free Palastine from evil aka idf
I would, the empire state building been lit up like the Israeli flag while they commit war crimes, it's only fair.
Zionism has always been headed by atheists or secularists.  Until the late 60s, it was seen as abhorrent by most religious Jews.
Yeah I can look at stuff on Wikipedia too:The country's name was changed in 1949 from Transjordan to Jordan and Palestinians were given seats in the Jordanian Parliament. A royal decree in March 1949 forbade the use of the term "Palestine" in legal documents, and other measures were designed to emphasize that there would not be an independent Palestine.
Palestinians are allowed to exist.Palestinians are not Hamas just as Jewish people are not the IDF.
Certainly wouldn‚Äôt be Antisemitic considering that the people of Gaza/Palestine are Semitic as well. People tend to forget that the Semitic people include Arabs.
Now, they should go and protest Hamas, outside Benyamin Netanyahu's house:https://www.timesofisrael.com/for-years-netanyahu-propped-up-hamas-now-its-blown-up-in-our-faces/https://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/2023-10-11/ty-article/.premium/netanyahu-needed-a-strong-hamas/0000018b-1e9f-d47b-a7fb-bfdfd8f30000
Jews have lived in the area for millennia, and for the last 1400 years generally peacefully alongside Muslims and Christians.  The prohibition isn‚Äôt on living there, but having a state.  It is a positive commandment to live there if possible.
God forbid you stand up for human rights and a crowd of protestors shows up. Insane.
Of all the flavors of religious extremists, I prefer the ones whose extremism makes them confront and oppose genocide.
My dream is to put up a border and leave the West Bank completely, leaving these people behind to wait for their messiah. -A Zionist
Wonder how many of them know that flag was designed by the British...
Angry mob.
Dirty fuckin zionist cunts.
Hope so, most of those Imbeciles aren‚Äôt even from there
Look, when the Messiah comes, then it means the end of the world, so let‚Äôs live in peace now cause each religion believes that he‚Äôll stand with them against the others.
Real estate, basically.
Palestinians have been oppressed by the zionist Israelis for decades, and now that they have retaliated, the media is calling them terrorists and justifying the war crimes done by Israel (using chemical weapons, airstriking residential buildings and hospitals, stoping water, electricity, food, fuel and aid) However, not all Jewish people are zionists and many condemn the actions of the and protest against the illegitimate state of Israel (like shown in the video)The villains are not the Jews it's the zionists and western  media.
Never seen a victim that regularly carpet bombs civilians in an open air prison.
Ultra Orthodox Israelis are anti Zionism. They believe God should be the one to re-make Israel.
A strange bunch?They are actively against an ongoing genocide taking place right now in gaza and the west bank with israel and the rest of the world cheering them on.They aren‚Äôt the strange ones living in israel.
Because the idea of Israel is based in Religion. It's not the promised land from "some" people, it's the promsied land of the Jewish People, in spirit, and in law. The entire premise of Israel is Jewish, and if a Jewish Zionist sees an anti-Zionist Jew, they see them as traitors to Judaism, which is fucking crazyAlso, when you ethnically cleanse a bunch of people and tell them yeah we're doing this because we're Jews and this is our promised land, and those people's kids ask who kicked us out and they say well rhe Jews did, pretty fucking stupid not to expect the kids to hate Jews, because kids aren't aware of the nuances and difference of Judaism and Zionsim due to years of distorting the difference between them by Israel, the kids don't know the different political accurate terms, all they know, is that Jews *self-admittedly* did that to them
These idiots are no better than that Zionist bully in Milan who harassed and assaulted the UNICEF workers. I wish I were that owner. I‚Äôd place a camera there and hang another Palestinian flag from the other window just to fuck with them. And whoever throws a rock can go to jail.
This kind of extremely fundamentalist and conservative religious movements are bonkers, no reason to defend them if you wouldn't defend fundamentalist Mormons, christians or Muslims.
Seems like a Good way to bait out some lawsuits and property damage. Hang a palestine and even a israel flag. Maybe a sign that says I don't think kids should suffer and die. And some cameras and let it roll
Do your research there was never isreal either and why would Palestines appear from nowhere it's like how America cleaned out the native Americans also The term "Palestine" first appeared in the 5th century BCE when the ancient Greek historian Herodotus wrote of a "district of Syria, called Palaistin√™" between Phoenicia and Egypt in The Histories
This sub keeps posting videos of these deranged neturei karta dudes and thinking they‚Äôre on their side lmao. These guys don‚Äôt want a Palestinian state out of the kindness of their hearts, people. They want Israel only to be established when the messiah comes, and ‚Äúwhen‚Äù that happens what do you think they‚Äôre hoping to do to the people who live there? I‚Äôll give you a hint: it‚Äôd make what Israel is doing now look like a playdate.
the vast majority of Tel Aviv is liberal and secular and does not participate in this bullshit.
Relevant when it comes to the topic of genocide:  [Two decades after 9/11 and a war on terror, do Muslim lives matter? - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2021/09/10/do-muslim-lives-matter/)Many people in the US are falling for the same exact logical fallacies that lead to Germany minimalizing the value of Jewish lives...just with the US, the vitriol directed towards Muslims and Islamic nations.  We need to fight terrorism for what it is...fight acts of genocide for what they are, but stop lumping populations and allowing our politicians and media outlets to conflate issues into something they are not...otherwise we end up with protests like the above video.  And even worse, a blind eye when our own nation or nation's allies commit atrocities.
&gt;The Talmudic belief is that creating Israel is abominationNot all, Most Orthodox Jews are Zionists.Some Ultra Orthodox Jews are antizionist because they believe the Messiah must take the land of Israel, destroy the dome of the rock, and build the 3rd temple.
These are not just Orthodox Jews. This is a small subset of ultra-orthodox jews called Neturei Karta. They are not necessarily pro-Palestinian. They are just against the State of Israel in general solely and exclusively on religious grounds. If there was no conflict with Palestinians they try to find other reasons to argue against the existence of the State of Israel. They are religious fanatics driven by Talmudic teachings, not righteousness or justice.

Hahaha they would execute him if he hanged that flag in *srael
Would be a much better video if the person was simply not home
To be fair, no one cares what the hasidics say. Their opinion holds no merit in society. If they won‚Äôt acknowledge a normal human being, we don‚Äôt need to acknowledge them
ƒ∞t's not even hamas flag. It is Palestinian flag ü§´ü§≠
There is nothing I understand about this conflict.
I would be the sleepiest sleeper known to man knowing that there are people outside my flat in Queens who hold no political power to stop war crimes were screaming outside to grandstand me just before my 9 - 5 where I will probably not be able to stop war crimes.
Well im pretty sure all jews are invited there. It's also the best place for them to debate and protest the other jews.
That makes sense
Imagine being so dumb not to not know difference between Hamas and Palestine üòÇ
Been trying to find it again, it was an a post where it shows her being taken. It‚Äôs how I came across this post too
Yeah. They seem pretty pissed off at all the colonization happening.
I‚Äôm going to agree with you and also smokes weed and is at every high school house party
I believe they're living in a historic Jewish neighborhood in Jerusalem that predates the establishment of Israel.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mea_Shearim
People forget that Palestinians are semites too LOL
The problem is there‚Äôs a wide spread campaign to conflate Palestine with Hamas. Even advocating support of humanitarian aid for Palestinians will, for some fucking reason, translate into ‚Äúso you supporting giving more supplies to Hamas‚Äù. It‚Äôs the same bullshit we saw post 9/11 where everyone with brown skin was assumed to be working for Al Qaeda.
Call the police on them. I'm sure it's illegal to make that noise at night in a neighborhood.
It would have been funny if they would have put a Nazi flag back up after taking the Palestinian flag down.
‚Äúzionists hate this one weird trick‚Äù
They‚Äôd probably seize their home altogether and kick them out. I‚Äôm not even Palestinian and I‚Äôm so angry for them. My heart hurts for all the innocent civilians/creatures affected on both sides üòû
I think, despite what media and bad actors would have us believe, that the overwhelming majority of Jews and Muslims are against everything that is happening and has been happening. As with everything else, there are a minority of extremely wealthy, extremely powerful people who‚Äôs voices rise up above the others to maintain their luxurious status quo at everyone‚Äôs else‚Äôs expense. ‚ÄúEat the rich‚Äù is the answer to this and pretty much all of the other major problems in the world.
Excuse me for being hurt over the fact that no one cares about us dying the way they care about others dying. Sorry, my bad. I'll go die quietly in a corner.
great point! let's expose the self-hating Jews /s.
A good comparison I heard is like the northern Irish who don‚Äôt want to part of the UK. They live in the UK, because Northern Ireland is part of the UK and they were born there, but they want their homeland to belong to Ireland. They are technically British, but would prefer to be Irish.
Who will the police side with? Brown Muslims, or brown Isrealis. You know that group of talked to by the police will name drop and talk about how this is the Holocaust and OMG antisemitism
Fuck that
How embarrassing to get your ass whipped in public by a child
I'm so sick of this stupid religious bullshit causing people to act like assholes.
I swear from a logical perspective, Israelis are the most anti-Semitic in the world!Cause even the Jewish people are criticizing the Israeli actions yet the Israelis are the first to bring the Jewish faith into the argument.And when that argument doesn‚Äôt work, they bring up the self-hating jew term‚Ä¶ even tho it‚Äôs not a religious war, yet religion is their first argument
::Shouts to take it down:: I'll take it down. ::Shouts after it's taken down:: Wtf do you want me to do here?
Fascists that's all
And the worse part is, this had jaxkshit to do with the United States. People were mad at 9/11 because no one knew why at the moment. These Israelis know exactly why they are always at war with the Arabs, and yet want to talk about something Germany did as a reaction to any criticism. Disgusting.
They live in that place physically, without supporting the idea that there should be a formal nation state. This isn‚Äôt hard.
I do, and vastly prefer their worldview to the current Israeli government
They have a name for that if you're a Jewish critic of Israel not even pro-Palestine; it's called [self-hating jew](https://www.businessinsider.com/alan-dershowitz-bernie-sanders-a-self-hating-jew-israel-palestine-2021-5#:~:text=Lawyer%20Alan%20Dershowitz%20called%20Sen.%20Bernie%20Sanders%2C%20who%20is%20Jewish%2C%20a%20%22self%2Dhating%20jew%22%20over%20his%20stance%20on%20the%20Israel%2DPalestine%20conflict.)

Idiots
The level of mental gymnastic some people can do to protect their fragile worldview is absolutely fascinating...
This is **EXACTLY** what everyone seems to be missing. How would they like it if Netanyahu ordered the slaughter of innocent civilians, yet everyone blamed all the Jews for what he did?
ain't his first rodeo
the video:"hasidic jews supporting Palestinian civil population under siege, and protesting war crimes."this fucking guy :"must be Hamas"
Zionists don‚Äôt want people to start questioning their narrative or for anyone to have freedom. Like the Taliban they are religious zealots that don‚Äôt deserve a seat at the table. All these religious zealots are ruining the world.
No, not really...Read the Talmud , those Jews believe in Talmud that say Israelis (real Israelites) are still under god punishment, they can't enter holy land ...Sign punishment are lifted by god is when the messiah arive from the mount of Zion ..only when messiah has appear then , they can enter holy land and Israel (holy land ) will be theirsThe king also will impose law of return , Cohen from Brooklyn or Jacob from Seattle will be kicked out of the holy land, law of return will be strict based on patrilineal bloodline , if your mother is a jew but your father Californian ... they'll kicked you outThey're against Zionism
Not the Talmudic belief. Its just a very small percent. Dont talk about what you dont know.
Right. Then they live in said formed country.
They believe the Jews are destined to live in exile without a state, as that is the destiny of the chosen people. They believe that to follow their holy scripture, they must not form a country.
I wonder if this is how the Night of Broken Glass looked beforehand also.
That would be assault and would play right into their victim narrative. What you do is set up some large speakers at your window and blast Fida'i at them on repeat.
This isn't to influence them. The US just blocked the UN from ordering a ceasefire. This is aimed at Us politicians.
üáµüá∏ Based flag üáµüá∏Settler-colonialism supporters can go cry somewhere else.
If I remember correctly they value life above all else so I don‚Äôt know if they‚Äôd risk it.
This is disgusting
It would be interesting to see what they say/do when/if  that happens. I.e actually join the army to take any lands they believe are theirs?
Correct. That's why we often have to correct people who think this is a religious conflict. This started as a secular conflict.
It's not a short memory, some people love to feel emotions, it breaks the monotony of their days, they feel more alive like thisSo their brain does adapt and hide some stuff that contradicts their belief and don't give any motivational boost to search for contradicting things
Well they don‚Äôt know the difference because they‚Äôve been equating anti Zionism with anti semitism for decades.
Hateful bastards.

Haha I had to laugh to that, it‚Äôs so true. Online is like hive mentality.
I was hoping someone would respond from the apartment, like a deaf person saying "I'm Deaf" and closing the window.
but what the fuck does Hamas have to do with Palestinian children massacred by bombs, stupid idiotsstupid indoctrinated people. Palestein children live don't Matter? it's not fashionable, no one says so, you suckI can't wait for you to become extinct with the next impending civil war.the world will be a better place
Attempting to suppress someone's free speech while they're in their home is pretty un-constitutional ideals. Akin to a modern cross burning.Is there not a lawyer nearby to educate them? /s Interesting legal quandary here. At what point is this harassment or stalking to the home/flag owner? Is the Palestinian flag viewed as hate speech similar to the Nazi flag? Shouldn't it be the hamas flag and symbology?Seriously this adds to the argument of having your 2a when you practice your 1a theory.
With a group outside my house like that, I‚Äôd have to start walking around strapped.
This sounds about right for Queens, that area of queens
People can‚Äôt even grow up as a kid being told they‚Äôre ruining the world, without turning into an adult and telling children they‚Äôre ruining the world.It‚Äôs so simplistic, and seeing as most people are completely incapable of comprehending it. I highly doubt they‚Äôd be capable at all with self reflection and learning from past events.
Proximity. Many fled Europe after the holocaust and there was either America or Israel. They may not support the government but they definitely enjoy the benefits they get from it.
But... then why would you choose to live there? I've heard this from people in NYC and other places, but not in Israel itself.
Sorry, why didn‚Äôt the residents call the police? This is absolutely harassment and disturbing the peace, arguably threats of mob violence, as well as possibly trespassing. There‚Äôs nothing legal about this gathering. I hate cops but the residents had every right to defend themselves and their property by summoning the authorities.

No brain, no brain, no brain, no brain
This shit is so wild. It's like everyone forgot what happened after 9/11. The blind nationalism. The propaganda. The xenophobia. The war that followed. I just don't understand how we can have such a short memory.
Hate to generalise but fair that say most Americans the rest of the world see on the Internet are so dumb...

Orthodox Jews. They‚Äôre a strange bunch. Extremely conservative and don‚Äôt support Israel as they believe they can only return to the holy land when the Messiah returns.
That's precisely what's happening! Surprised they've not commented 'self-hating Jews!' yet. Still, there's time I suppose.
You are not a victim!! You are not a victim!! You are not a victim!! Kwicherbichen!! Kwicherbichen!! Kwicherbichen!!
Shouting ‚Äúno hamas‚Äù these people are dumb. Supporting Palestine does not mean supporting Hamas

They even harass palestinians in usa, where they do not have real jurisdiction. Can you guess what they could do in Palestine?
Zionists are the absolute worst of humanity. They somehow think they are on the right side of history by demanding that Palestinians are wiped off the face of the earth and deny even their existence. All this DESPITE having to go through the same thing they are now putting the Palestinians through, a century ago. Have you no shame, humanity or inability to look past your tribal alliance to an apartheid, genocidal state.
True... American needs to take this slow and chill for sure.
Imagine if a crowd of people did the same with an Israeli flag.  Would instantly get called antisemitic. And probably cops would get involved
If you hit a power pole stay in your vehicle man! Worse comes to it and you need to bail (vehicle on fire) jump out without touching your vehicle and land with both feet together and shuffle your ass out of there. Line on truck, you touch truck and ground, power goes through you to get to ground. Then there's step potential. You hop out and take normal steps, as soon as that foot touches the ground you've got a difference of potential between foot 1 and foot 2.
And you think Israel is an apartheid state? Do you think Israel is against the two-state solution? So really regarding the two countries Israel is now against how can we agree to such a thing?! After what they did they kidnapped hundreds of children and killed thousands of people in our country like in the movies it's a holocaust.Now the IDF will enter Gaza and topple Hamas and then there may be a two-state solution Hamas wants against the whole world and even against Gaza The proof that they murdered with their rocket 800 poor children in a hospital in Gaza just to blame Israel. They don't care about keeping it, they care about killing us, that's all If you think that Israel is doing apartheid, tell him and he will explain to you why not
Look at the dusty old guard trying to conduct the group of chanters
"Not letting me oppress you is you oppressing me!"
I'm confused; the Jewish people in this clip are defending Palestinians, correct?Edit: I've read all the replies and what I was confused about is I didn't expect to find any Jews in Israel and/or Palestine other than Zionists.    Now I know.
As a result they are also indirectly harassing every man, woman and child that lives in those other blocks and have nothing to do with this. It‚Äôs also in the evening. I know NY is dubbed the city that never sleeps but this demonstration is horrible.
No hummus? üòî
Sounds kind of like an Andalusian accent too me, which is close enough geographically speaking
Seriously.
Can we please get a moratorium on Israel/Palestine videos?
Look at these fascist pieces of shit
It is clearly a gypsy accent, not at all similar to that of Murcia.
He's currently touring and the show is called "An Evening With The Late John Cleese".
Nice Fake News. Hamas was it. Why you supported the Hamas?
This America, not Israel, ya douchebags! Fuck on off. They can hang any flag they want.
Shame on you , you monsters, that's clear evidence of how much discrimination and oppression they face .
I wouldn't have believed it if I hadn't actually seen how it happened.
Misinformed morons make great useful idiots.
The cameraman is indeed one of the thieves.
Mfs in NY apparently got nothing better to do with their time

Can't park there mate
"I will ask you a direct question please answer did Mandela endorse or condemn the violence committed by the ANC ?"You answered your own question here:"Defending the shift in strategy as a last resort, Mandela said in one of his interviews from prison, ‚Äú‚ÄòThe armed struggle [with the authorities] was forced on us by the government.'‚ÄùWhy do you believe people being brutally oppressed should condemn themselves for fighting back against their oppressors?Apartheid would still be around today if people of color inside South Africa simply stood by,did nothing, and were 'obedient' to those oppressing them."In a 1986 speech, President Reagan also warned of ‚Äúcalculated terror by elements of the African National Congress,‚Äù including ‚Äúthe mining of roads, the bombings of public places, designed to bring about further repression, the imposition of martial law, and eventually creating the conditions for racial war.‚Äù The Department of Defense included the ANC in a 1."988 report billed as profiles of ‚Äúkey regional terrorist groups‚Äù from around the world"Ronald Reagan was clearly on the wrong side of history since his veto was overuled and the US eventually imposed sanctions in late 1986."The Department of Defense included the ANC in a 1988 report billed as profiles of ‚Äúkey regional terrorist groups‚Äù from around the world.

Watcha mean? Cut a hole in the roof m and unload the truck into it. Tell the driver and the neighbors to chill, power company won‚Äôt be out for hours‚Ä¶
These are bigots. They talk about "right to exist" but wont give it to Palestinians.
Little late but your comment is something I‚Äôve also noticed.  Some subs brigade Israeli support.  Others brigade Palestinian support.  Subreddits have always been their own little hive minds, and a divisive event/topic really showcases that.To say the Israel/Gaza situation is decisive might be the understatement of the year lol
How do you start a fight with a child and lose üòî
I like that you posted many sources and quotes but please don't pick and choose to win an argument. I will ask you a direct question please answer did Mandela endorse or condemn the violence committed by the ANC ? Let me give you a hint . That‚Äôs when the Sharpeville Massacre took place. In 1960, South African police killed 69 black protesters in the town 40 miles south of Johannesburg; amid the crackdown that followed, the government banned the ANC. As the ANC went underground, Mandela became the head of the military wing of the African National Congress, Umkhonto we Sizwe (Spear of the Nation), also known as MK. In 1964, he was convicted of sabotage and treason, and wound up imprisoned until 1990. TIME later described the group‚Äôs activities from 1962 as ‚Äúlow-level guerrilla war.‚ÄùDefending the shift in strategy as a last resort, Mandela said in one of his interviews from prison, ‚Äú‚ÄòThe armed struggle [with the authorities] was forced on us by the government.'‚ÄùIn a 1986 speech, President Reagan also warned of ‚Äúcalculated terror by elements of the African National Congress,‚Äù including ‚Äúthe mining of roads, the bombings of public places, designed to bring about further repression, the imposition of martial law, and eventually creating the conditions for racial war.‚Äù The Department of Defense included the ANC in a 1988 report billed as profiles of ‚Äúkey regional terrorist groups‚Äù from around the world.

I will leave with this last words from Mandela "our freedom is incomplete without the freedom of the Palestinians"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/12/palestinians-draw-parallels-mandela-anti-apartheid
Night waste
He is not of the thieves, he is helping the guy in the bulldozer
"sir, you can't park there"
Then you would become them. Display whatever flag you want in your property, the end. Call the police if they keep making noise.
But remember, these mofo's are always the victim while chanting take it down.
The irony of Chicago asking for a ceasefire
Ya from 1517 to 1917. Your welcome. Now go study.
It's not my job to educate. That's a personal journey. But I will point you to sources if you really  want.
I‚Äôd come up with a scathing response but I lack the attention span to do so‚Ä¶ *ooooh squirrel*
if you know so much So teach me history
If you're Israeli you don't seem to even know your own history or how your country was founded. I highly recommend you pick up a book that isn't written by either Israel or the US and double check things.
I‚Äôd throw a pot of dirty water on them
You're confusing a non aggression pact with an alliance. They're not the same. At all. The ussr and nazi germany weren't allies. Go pick up a history book that wasn't written in the US during the red scare.
First of all, if Israel had not provided them with water, electricity and fuel, they would have died. Because if all their money they go and develop rockets. Secondly, do you know Israel's War of Independence? If so, you should know that on the day they gave us our country, the Arabs did not agree with that even though they didn't have a country either and that meant being half and half even more to them Area.They got angry at the state of Israel and they decided to attack us the day after the state was established!!! Isn't that excessive? Israel fought with strength (which we did not have) and we defeated them And instead of killing, killing everyone there or deporting everyone, we only killed the terrorists. You can see Gaza today as proof, they didn't deserve it .At the end of these days, Israel asked all residents of southern Gaza to leave for the north so that Israel would not be harmed by those looking for a crime.Hamas said they will kill anyone who goes to the north. Now I ask you, dictatorial or democratic Hamas. After all, there is no freedom of choice here. Right?
They seemed really irate about it and full of energy/s
What about your copy paste answers anything I said? I'm not denying what Hamas did or saying it wasn't a travesty. But you have to understand Israel has fostered the exact conditions that lead to rebellion. How is it you think they have the ability to turn off power and water to millions of people and blockade them from receiving support. You're absolutely blind if you don't see the power dynamics at play. Let me put it this way. If the tables were turned and it was Israel in the situation that Gaza now faces, would you be shocked if your countrymen attempted to rebel? Is it not better to die on your feet trying for a better life than to waste away in a ditch dug by your oppressor?
It‚Äôs a trip for sure.
Horses are also often brought in to forcefully disperse a large crowd.They're not as effective against small amounts of people.
In the meantime I am waiting for an answer
Yes. I'm going to copy paste from my previous answers I don't see a problem here
You're really just going to copy paste? Do you have anything meaningful to say or do you take us all for fools. Go ahead. Collect your paycheck from Mossad. We can still see and hear and not all of us are only watching the media that tows the line.
Ok. Let's take an example that you live in a country and suddenly on a holiday in your country many people from your country who have nothing to do with electricity that day (the religious ones) return from the synagogue and hear alarms and wake up at 6:04 out of bed. What would happen then?! How would you react? It doesn't end here.On that day, hundreds of Hamas operatives broke through the fence and entered our country, killing thousands of children, old parents and entire families!!! Injured thousands more people. And worst of all, hundreds of children were kidnappedHow would you react to that?! So I will explain to you how Israel reacted, it killed major activists of the organization without harming innocent civilians In the end Hamas launched a missile from Gaza and it hit a hospital inside Gaza and killed 800 children and they just say they don't care just kill us. Do you understand that they don't really care about Gaza? Do you understand that Israel wanted countless times to make a peace agreement and they refused? Do you understand that Israel supplies Gaza with water, electricity, fuel? And in one moment she can turn off the water and everyone there will die. and Israel not doing it So let them say thank you that they have water or electricity at all
They are gipsy. 100%. Their accent its different, their looking, and they use words that ppl from the same region dont. The video was shot in Guadalajara. Not Murcia.
Where do I start.... Stolen land. Genocide. Apartheid. 75+ years or people moving to the area, taking Palestinians homes. Kicking those Palestinians to the strip. Fostering Hamas as a way to weaken them and keep them from being viewed as a legitimate nation in their own right. Having one of the most advanced intelligence apparatus of the world and "missing" this attack coming even after *iran* warned them of it. Yeah. I'd like to hear your take.
Come on tell me your position
That's a pretty extreme view, ig you're entitled to your opinion but I am curious to know if you at least acknowledge it's a pretty extreme view to wipe an incomprehensible amount of human beings off the map because you (1 human being across the world with completely different understanding of the world around you, completely different culture etc.) Have an opinion that they harbour terrorists
Are these ppl rly harassing someone outside their own property about a flag. take your pathetic protest somewhere else.
Just because someone is hanging a Palestinian flag in their window doesn't mean that they support Hamas or that they're antisemitic. The people harassing the people living there are angry bigots.
‚Äúyou gonna just let him talk to you like that?!‚Äù
"Do you really think that he was put in jail for 27 years and called a terrorist because of the electricity  pylons "Yes. Considering that the Apartheid government: 1)routinely,arrestedtortured,disappeared,hanged,Anti-Apartheid  activists and even assassinated some abroad."Falling down a flight of stairs while in custody" was only some of the bizarre explanations they came up with.They were doing Putin type things back then. 2) developed a biological weapons programme specifically aimed against black people. "The apartheid government was pleading with him to tell the ANC to put the guns down for seven years before he was released."Mandela's response to them was:"SOWETO, South Africa¬†‚Äî¬†¬†Nelson Mandela, the imprisoned leader of the African National Congress, on Sunday firmly rejected the South African government‚Äôs offer of conditional freedom and instead set forth his own terms for negotiations between his outlawed organization and the nation‚Äôs white regime.‚ÄúI cannot sell my birthright nor am I prepared to sell the birthright of the people to be free,‚Äù Mandela, 66, declared in a message from his prison cell in Cape Town, where he is serving a life sentence imposed in 1964 after his conviction on charges of sabotage and plotting revolution.‚ÄúI cannot and will not give any undertaking at a time when I and you, the people, are not free,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúYour freedom and mine cannot be separated.‚ÄùSouth African President Pieter W. Botha, in a gesture meant to demonstrate his government‚Äôs commitment to reform, had offered to free Mandela and other black nationalist leaders if they renounced violence as a means of fighting apartheid (institutionalized separation of the races) and agreed to obey the country‚Äôs strict internal security laws.‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised at the conditions that the government wants to impose on me,‚Äù Mandela said in a statement read by his daughter Zinzi at a rally here. ‚ÄúI am not a violent man. . . . It was only when all other forms of resistance were no longer open to us that we turned to armed struggle."https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1985-02-11-mn-4278-story.html"Mandela pleaded guilty in court to acts of **public violence (193 counts)** and as a result, was sentenced to life in prison in 1964.

why fuck does it start with subtitles, randomly zooms in and removes subtitles, then zooms out and regains subtitles? i don't understand why people shit out content like this.
For example Tammy Duckworth is on the U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee and on the Foreign Relations Committee. She's definitely going to be one of the people trying to push funding for Israel today.It's important for all our politicians that are complicit in this to know there is a large amount of us that will not forget this
Good lord the US never fails to blow my mind
so there is no apartheid in Palestinians lol Israel's are not occupiers and Palestinians are not kicked out of their land in illegal settlements by the way those settlers are armed plus protected lol. please read more
Obviously you should re-edit the video with footage of IDF air strikes and reupload.
Even at the very least, it can soften your politician's stance on things. For example, my zionist loving senator at the very least seemed to have asked for humanitarian aid. (Now I would like her to please take a look at what the bombs she's sending have been doing to the people of Palestine). Especially if you combine protesting with targeted calls to make sure your leaders know you were there and will be fully willing to protest right outside their office if need be
So either you are not very knowledgeable with Mandela's  biography and the ANC or you just want to ignore the facts . the way you are describing Mandela is like Gandhi lol. Do you really think that he was put in jail for 27 years and called a terrorist because of the electricity  pylons  the apartheid government was pleading with him to tell the ANC to put the guns down for seven years before he was released. Mandela pleaded guilty in court to acts of **public violence (193 counts)** and as a result, was sentenced to life in prison in 1964.  I rest my case please research more
The problem is that if as a doctor you don‚Äôt do it, the person will seek to still do it and harm themselves more. So by accepting, you are actually saving the persons life
Was he sober when he decided to wear the pink shirt?
Cops or not they are in better shape than 90% of Americans
Taking out the garbage to the street nothing to see here
Sit quietly and watch the genocide on TV like a good citizen or get brutalized by fascist pigs. Very cool.
Unfortunately gaza if u dont know is like a jail and they dont have much while isreal.is backed by america  and they have everything and thats why they can protect their children better  also who told you they are using the children as human shield the west media? Ya ofc , Where the fuck do you want them to go  isreal bombed their school their hospitals their churrches  their houses where do you want them to go to be  protected  where?? Are you fucking stupid? Why dont isreal just stops bombing them  cuz they know that more children will die but they dont care and instead go invade gaza and stop this then ?? Why? They to scared you know isreal would be nothinggg without america they would  wouldve been finished if it wasnt for america.
When did Ottomans tried to exterminate jews. Maybe you should get your facts right
I already know that the towing company or whoever was tasked with getting the truck was scratching their heads when they arrived. I'd be at a loss for words.
There's another African bull elephant baby video on reddit, where the little guy is spreading his ears and seems genuinely irritated that the people in the car are laughing at his attempts to flex. Those people need to see this video.
yes.
Frozen in a steep dive. Legendary.
Or maybe isreal shouldve stopped harassing them in the aqusa ans let them pray in peace  and stopped bombing them  years ago and kill their children befor all this happend btw also they send rockets in every holiday they have.
Hamas fires rockets from school roof. Isreal sends bomb. Rockets and school destroyed. Hamas- "why bomb school?"

It was palestine
Lma what?? It was nothing befor that ü§°ü§°
Is mostly "a lot of rambling about, what are you doing, c'mon! You're going to kill me"...."move, move"
MuSt Be AnTiSeMiTeS....
I think it's weird that they build these houses right on the highway.  There's nothing around for miles, but the house has to be right on the highway.
Sir, you can't park here..
These shits don‚Äôt even understand the very fact that they‚Äôre being able to sit and scream at the police is something they‚Äôre not afforded in the country they so  boldly want to defend.
I don't think the Palestinians are happy with Isreal.  That's my take.
Honestly with tax payers money I don‚Äôt get it but 2024 this dude is going to be packed up can‚Äôt wait use tax papers dollars on America not some shit Americans don‚Äôt care about or have no control over
Very true, but this research is very extensive. The conflict that is currently going on has been ongoing for hundreds of years. Civilian deaths are horrific don‚Äôt get me wrong. But tell me if there has ever been a war without civilian deaths? Unfortunately that‚Äôs a severe side effect of war.
You want aid? Trade your weapons for food!
well according to western media ANC did. Every crime is wrong but if many lies are used to create a propaganda justifying the killing of thousands of civilians then we need to do more research
Okay
Yeah, I know. I was being ironic bc they are drawing similarities between what Mandela did and what Hamas is doing. Which they‚Äôre are none. Sorry if it wasn‚Äôt obvious.
He didn't. You can simply read the Wikipedia page of his Rivonia Trial to see that he was convicted for  sabotaging electricity pylons where there was no civilians.
Bet u were masturbating while looking at these pics
this is the most low budget propaganda i‚Äôve ever seen can u at least make it believable
Hmm interesting. So light theft and some drywall damage maybe?
Y‚Äôall it‚Äôs AAVE üôÑ
Good 1 truck 1 hostage or we burn the trucks
Bethany...
When has this ever been attempted?  I have never seen anything where America or other nations have said they will cut all aid to Israel if they don‚Äôt do these things.
Pretty sure one of the moderators is bent that way.  I noticed a few months ago that there were a surprising number of barely interesting videos from that part of the world.
White phosphorus is not a war crime ya dunce
Oh didn‚Äôt realize Mandela led an attack on South Africa that murdered, raped, and tortured innocent civilians like Hamas.
Wait.... What
You realise Hamas would slaughter the gays. They despise them more then the jews. It's made as an ironic post so that libs stop blindly supporting violence. As they do.
I wouodnt say it‚Äôs gipsy. Spains accents vary widely depending on region and even city. Kinda sounds like how they speak in Murcia
I'm good. I'll be happy. In a few weeks when you see inside Gaza. Your gonna be ashamed.
In a few years you‚Äôre gonna look back at this time in your life and be embarrassed.
No. He hates my bussy now. He says akmed is tighter. I'm so upset leave me alone.
They need to whip some rotten eggs her way.
They‚Äôre not fed up, they‚Äôre instructed to remove them.
Israel's Retaliation after hamas fired thousands of rockets and went house to house slaughtering people. There I fixed your title.
I know you think you‚Äôre being funny and that this is some sort of quality level of troll, but I can only assume you are 12 years old. This is low IQ low quality low effort low humour and you are only wasting your own time. We better do better.
Gaza is 45% children, they didn't do anything. Maybe Israel can stop the blockade and indiscriminate bombing too
&gt; At the end of June 2023, the Israel Prison Service (IPS) was holding 147 Palestinian minors in detention or in prison on what it defined ‚Äúsecurity‚Äù grounds. At that time, the IPS was also holding 26 Palestinian minors for being in Israel illegally. https://www.btselem.org/statistics/minors_in_custody---Maybe Apartheid Israel can do the same and end the violence?
Sometimes he bang unwilling hostage cause he sad lil man. But I love my ham daddy.
Reddit all I have after he left me for another man.
Aha
Yeah fr
I'm so sad he only bang his boys now never me
I‚Äôll buy that for a dollar!
Get a life
And still no one gaf
But I thought European police weren‚Äôt violent?!
Unfortunately one side is using their children while the other is protecting it. Not saying every case is the same but children are humans and Hamas uses human shields.
That's amazing
Its the same old, first Islamic terror attacks, then conflicts with lost territory - rinse and repeat.
He showed them how to cut their cable bill in half.
Maybe Hamas should stop firing rockets at Israel huh.
‚ÄúWhy can‚Äôt people protesting something inhumane protest the specific inhumane thing I care about‚Äù in the middle of an active genocidal bombing spree paid for with US tax dollars.
A lot of the ships that took the European refugees to British occupied Palestine were American luxury liners. They were warned by Britain not to bring the Jewish refugees illegally to Palestine. They did it anyway and eventually the pressure on Britain to allow the migration and expel Palestinians from their homes was too great by America and our allies in the UN so it happened. Soon after Britain evacuated. It has been horrible ever since for both sides.
Hamas isn‚Äôt in the West Bank and Israel still broke a record this year for Palestinians they murdered in the West Bank.
Okay thank you for the clarification
We need these psa's.
Chicago needs a ceasefire
I think it got more to do with..  you know all the video evidence. Better luck with the next propaganda pice.
It‚Äôs a Spanish democracy manifest guy lol
I've done this before...going to a protest for something relevant to your country while living in another country. Besides seeing the numbers of folk out, it's pretty much just all performative and feels a bit silly with getting nothing accomplished.
Looks like rich frat guy got his ass kicked. Go Stone Cutters.
Was there terror attacks against Jewish civs before that?
Similar to how ISIS used Islam to justify their ethnic cleansing, does that mean that its suddenly justified to go and destroy any mosque around the world?
Get those nazis, how they DARE to protest the poor and righteous victims of Israel? Nazis.
Yes I am sure they were. And no one in their right minds would support the killing of innocent life. But why are we always comparing? Why is it that we cannot find an ounce of compassion and love in our heart to just take a step back for a second and see that ‚Äúother‚Äù person as a human too? Why does it need to be either or? You either sympathize with Israeli children or with Palestinians? This is just beyond sickening. The fact that people have so much hatred and darkness in their hearts that they refuse to see the other side of the story or to emphasize with acts of brutal violence is just unfathomable for me. Shame on us, all of us as a collective for failing all these children like this, for instilling hate and fear in the hearts of our own children.
i cant wait to hear this one...lay it down then
Israell and Hamas are both shit.
Oh boi, I wonder what side started with the suicide bombers.
Rest of the spanish-speaking world agrees.
It‚Äôs getting more apparent that the only thing killed may have just been a bunch of cars.  I have yet to see a blown up hospital.
American is sending over military planes to israel... american is arming israel instead of making peace
You can‚Äôt park there
&gt;You're right it's totally fine if Jewish children died as long as only a few were beheaded.and youre okay with the babies israel are bombing
Oops there goes gravity
&gt;why it's pretty unacceptable to have your neighbours want you to not exist.then why is israel doing it to palestain?
&gt;Let's see them being progressive when theyre actually living in Israel and their 12 year old sister and their grandmother are marched in the street to cheers from the crowds and then held captive in Gaza.and what about when this happened to palestainains? When israels would break open their doors and kick them out of their houses? Or the "12 year old sisters" being blown up in Gaza rn?
there were college kids that signed something about protecting gaza and they were doxxed and threatened. The school tried to do something but i mean, what can a college do when peoples addresses are posted online?
I‚Äôm not gonna lie maybe it‚Äôs cause it doesn‚Äôt seem like English is your first language but I‚Äôm really not sure which side you arguing for even‚Ä¶ üòÖ
Its gonna take a lot more then a 5 second drone shot of some trucks to convince me that Israel is blocking aid. This is just a guy saying stuff.
Got it. Thank you for taking the time to explain.
Who did the world steal it from?The British?   Or the ottoman empire that the British took it from when the League of Nations set up the British mandate after WW1?
Fascists stick together. Thick as thieves
Just because we're not there yet does not make it unwise. Also I believe. You both state the same answer order slightly different.
Having lived through the experience, I'm still kicking myself for not telling the guy to set it on fire when he ditched it. He had sideswiped several trees with it, the cops had left finger printing dust all over everything in the van, and we still had to pay the impound storage fees to get it back...
Huh, I wondered why I could only understand about every third word. But then I remembered that despite 4 yrs of it in high school, I can't actually speak Spanish...
He probably wore it because he liked the color. Which is fine. Lots of dudes had a pink shirt.If he purposely wore it to intentionally start fighting, then that would be gay as fk of your friend. Intentionally dressing in a way to attract physical contact with other men. Sounds like shit a gay guy would be likely to do. I mean whatever floats your boat. But if you're looking for women, maybe you shouldn't be so worried about getting the attention of men.
They love to blend in with the population when it's convenient for them.
That is very common in Dutch public events where there‚Äôs a lot of chaos and rioting or general public disorder. They don‚Äôt just arrest everyone. They‚Äôll whack the crap out of people first. They reserve arrests for the most extreme people in the situation.
It's weird how support for Israel is so different between different subs on this site. Your comment is not unreasonable.
I don‚Äôt think option 3 is wise. That would require reciprocity and mutual understanding from both sides, and I don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre at that point.We‚Äôre pretty clearly looking at a game-theoretical environment here, where both sides are willing to sacrifice the greater good in order to get a potential leg up on one another. If either side shows weakness right now, the game theory dictates that the other will take full advantage.There‚Äôs only 3 ways this ends in reality:One side ends up getting an unconditional surrender from the other.Both sides becoming militarily exhausted and ending in a stalemate.Or some serious mediators come in and apply enough leverage to demand a stop to the hostilities. (Which in all likelihood just kicks the can down the road and the cycle continues)
Yep, have lived in NL. Police can be very aggressive. Have seen them beat the absolute crap out of people and have had a couple of negative interactions with them (when they were in the wrong) and got threatened with being arrested for literally no reason.They rarely pull a gun but they don‚Äôt hesitate to get into a fight with you and beat you.
Dutch police don‚Äôt discriminate. There‚Äôs a video around somewhere of them whacking the crap out of a young male in Rotterdam during a football match where the public devolved into chaos. What appeared to be the mother angrily approached the cop right after he hit her son and he smacked her as well, with just as much force.They also tend to use dogs on people and let the dog rip away at a person for a loooong time before stopping it.
As an elephant pet owner, do NOT let your elephant play with your car. This has to be the most simple mistake to avoid.
the zzzzzzz
dozed off i bet
Haha I agree, but maybe make the thieves walk home, or to the police station and let the police return the van.
She is probably thinking, Who is Shane
In what world do police beat people instead of arresting them?
Prolly cuz they full or rockets ffs
Oh, so much unadulterated boot licking."Do as the police say, or they can beat you"
It's because the other cities might simply not know about their previous violations if they have any. Though, I believe that police departments are starting to share that sort of information at least within states.
How can you see something like that and not say anything? I'm amazed the dashcam driver says nothing at all.

Ok. Let's take an example that you live in a country and suddenly on a holiday in your country many people from your country who have nothing to do with electricity that day (the religious ones) return from the synagogue and hear alarms and wake up at 6:04 out of bed. What would happen then?! How would you react? It doesn't end here.On that day, hundreds of Hamas operatives broke through the fence and entered our country, killing thousands of children, old parents and entire families!!! Injured thousands more people. And worst of all, hundreds of children were kidnappedHow would you react to that?! So I will explain to you how Israel reacted, it killed major activists of the organization without harming innocent civilians In the end Hamas launched a missile from Gaza and it hit a hospital inside Gaza and killed 800 children and they just say they don't care just kill us. Do you understand that they don't really care about Gaza? Do you understand that Israel wanted countless times to make a peace agreement and they refused? Do you understand that Israel supplies Gaza with water, electricity, fuel? And in one moment she can turn off the water and everyone there will die. and Israel not doing it So let them say thank you that they have water or electricity at all
Ok explain it then. Us retards need to be educated by our superiors I guess.

I think most recent wars have had forms of protests in the USA, including ones Americans have fought in. It's a way for the public to show their support, even though it might not change a thing.
Eh. Let's see what the pro Israeli say. I'll give them a gold upvote if they convince me enough to change sides.
Allahi  malahii Tomato tomato
American Jews asking the politicians in America for a cease fire between Israel and Hamas. What?They should protest for a peace agreement between north and South Korea while they are asking for things that American politicians have no power over
Some 1/6 protesters acted abhorrently. But, others casually strolled in while capital police held the door open for them.
Holy smokes! What a pickle!
Brains are so weird. I heard every one of those sentences/words as I read them.  So maybe they were saying all of them???
*scrotum face*
But how much later will it hurt
I appreciate you for pointing that out.  Not sarcasm lol
&gt; CONTEXT: after **throwing fireworks** in the train station and refusing to disperse, that‚Äôs when the police drew batons and moved them outside, away from train passengers.So, probably the police don‚Äôt like unruly protesters? Maybe nothing to do with what you‚Äôre protesting about, they just don‚Äôt like the way you‚Äôre disrupting everybody?

It's a cycle, and you don't need to have a PhD to see biased stance within university direction. Why did FIRE rank Harvard a zero for free speech in 23'? You citing the viewpoint of university "experts" is not a valid argument. Might be to some, but when I was enrolled, we still had conversations and freedom of thought. Now it's about avoidance of wrong thought and repeat my views back to me verbatim so you can buy a degree. Sorry if that is too casual of a viewpoint of the current academic environment, but I'm clearly from a different generation.

If someone has a PhD in something and teaching a univeristy-level class about it, I think it's fair to say they're on expert on the topic. When you have entire relevant academic departments in universities around the world endorsing a view, you can't just dismiss out of hand so casually.

Good argument. Lol
So if I understand what you're saying, India (your country) has different police departments for each state, but each department communicates so that people cannot rejoin a force in a different state.Frankly, that might actually be the case in the US on the state level, which is held to a higher standard. But we also have independent local police departments in each town/county, and those have worse communication and lower standards.So that's really the key thing, imo: does India not have local police forces?
"Excuse me, sir! You can't park your truck here."

Amazing how Gaza is running out of everything except‚Ä¶ rockets. Coincidence I am sure.
I thought this was r/crazyfuckingvideos nothing ‚Äúcrazy fucking‚Äù about this video sigh
Every policeman /woman are state police, they can get transferred or placed throughout the state. Higher officials can get placed outside the state in a different part of the country as well. They cannot join the force again anywhere in the country once fired. Mostly the state police head is likely not from that state. They keep getting transferred every few years. So there is no internal foul play going on. Just copied this from an article for better understanding. "Each state has its own police force, which is headed by a Director General of Police. The police system also includes specialized units, such as the Central Reserve Police Force and the Rapid Action Force, which are tasked with maintaining internal security and counter-terrorism operations."

**What the hell are you talking about when you say the Arab conquests expelled the Jews?** The Arab conquest of Jerusalem took place in 637AD. Jews were forbidden from pilgrimage and settling the land. After the Muslims took over, Jews were allowed to settle in the city and conduct their pilgrimage. When the crusaders took Jerusalem, they butchered every single Muslim AND Jew until blood was up to their knees. The Arab conquests emancipated the Jews from the Romans who had destroyed the Second Temple in 70AD and killed MILLIONS of Jews across the empire. When the Spanish Inquisition started to take place after the fall of Granada in 1492, Sephardic Jews fled to the Ottoman Empire in places like Thessaloniki, Palestine, and North Africa while the Mizrahim lived jointly with Muslim elsewhere in MENA.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Jewish‚ÄìRoman_War

The thieves are constantly yelling that they were gonna crush the van. At one point a worker asks "and what are you even doing here?" to which the cameraman responds that they (the workers) are completely in the right but beg them to not do anything.The cameraman at one point says that (the workers) want to kill them, to which another worker scoffs. After the van is tipped over, they (the thieves) say they're calling the police and the gendarmerie. From there they keep accusing the workers of wanting to kill them, and that they're gonna pay for the van. One of the workers asks "hey were you recording when you broke in?".At the 3 minute mark he makes a video call to his "brother-in-law", says he'll send him the location and then asks him to come pick them up.

You've made an important distinction. I also felt that Trump was giving Russia what they wanted, but in a different way, which would have prevented the outbreak in Ukraine. Not necessarily all the govt secrets in his bathroom, but rather placating Putin's fears of aggression on our part and offering a similar philosophy to his in terms of priorities of a country - fellowship, you could say. I think Putin deep down wants security for Russia and feels he needs to wield a big stick, similar to Trump. The two are similar but we do not need to worry because its always the people who embody them into power.The Israel debacle might have still happened, but I think Trump would shut down the innocent slaughter of civilians faster than Biden did. Until Biden got back from his trip, we were really worried if he would even be advocating for the Palestinians at all.
I wouldn't say everytown. But all major city's can expect friendly visitors. Just be aware.
No, because as you can see this is a actually a substantial number of people in real life and not a small number of people in the Internet that you like to focus on to try to discredit dissenting views.
We have state police, county police, municipal police, various federal agencies, and more. So lots of different departments without a centralized leadership. If a cop gets expelled from one department, they can often join one the next town over, assuming that town doesn't care or doesn't do their homework. I'm curious, does your country not have local police separate from federal police? I didn't realize it was like that elsewhere.
Wrong.
Wrong

I didnt know Hamas translated to Hate. That only reinforces the issue that love destroys hate.  Americans were wrong to think their choices were limited to political representation, and that our thoughts, words, and behavior have an impact on the conditions which create violence and polarity between nations. The blame should not be placed at the feet of only politicians. If Hamas/terrorists have infiltrated the world at the level of every town, then world peace truly does begin with you. Love one another, dispel the hate in your lives. Forgiving another allows the possibility to receive God's grace. Go make right with your brother - then you can make your sacrament at the altar.

Not sure if it was just stylistic, but I think it's worth pointing out:"...Jewish children dying....Muslim children being killed...'The way you've written it, you make it sound like Jewish children are just dying for unknown reasons while Muslim children are being specifically targeted. Jewish children were targeted, maimed, and murdered. It's not a passive thing or something that just happened, and it's every bit as despicable.
Police is just the voice of the majority: you did your demonstrations, now what.
We do learn just very slowly, and we also have a tendency for forgetfulness when we all get angry.Times they are changing, and life is getting better and less brutal all the time.The struggle to improve will always drive us forward and from time to time society will get scared and run back to our old ways, but sure as the sun will rise so to will we from the ashes of our own destruction new and better for the lessons we learn until the next time that we decide to give into our fears.

Delivering a new rooftop patio?
But if they get fired can they join the force again in a different city?
It means Israel. But I will explain each answer to you
What does "a place that understands" mean OP?
No. In the US typically the violence comes from a relatively small number of cops who will get charged over and over again with rights violations and even murder, and still have jobs. Remember those riots back in 2020 about the cop who sat on a guy until he died? That wasn‚Äôt the first person he‚Äôd done that to. He‚Äôd gotten that city sued for millions of dollars, a case which the victim won, for doing the exact same thing before. That wasn‚Äôt even the first person he‚Äôd killed. It wasn‚Äôt even the second. And yet he still had a job. In Europe a cop who cost his city tens of thousands or millions of dollars would at the very least be fired.
Because they‚Äôre going to stop and say ‚ÄúOh look what they‚Äôre doing in Chicago. We should stop.‚Äù
Ok. What are your claims against the State of Israel?
That's how it is in my country as well. I thought it was same everywhere. Is it not like that in the US?
Utter nonsense. No one fears Trump. He‚Äôs a bafoon. Trump would have handed Ukraine to Russia on a gold platter while wearing a butt plug and simping to Putin.

Out of curiosity, what would Trump have done that would‚Äôve prevented these two wars? On it‚Äôs face that claim seems ridiculous. He‚Äôs been posturing to just give Russia what it wants. So if you mean, Russia would‚Äôve actually taken Ukraine in 3 days and currently there would be no war then I agree with you. And really if you take it a step further one could speculate that without the war in Ukraine what‚Äôs happening in Gaza might not be happening (yet) I could believe that, as I can see how this conflict helps Russia in the other conflict. So hey. Your right. These two wars may not be happening right now. But it‚Äôs because Russia would‚Äôve just taken land from a sovereign ppl and it‚Äôs quite possible no one would‚Äôve stopped them. Again. Your are right but for, the wrong reason I would say.

Unpopular opinion here: during high school one of my classmates was a girl from Pakistan. Everytime something happened to cause damages to Muslims in general, she would be really vocal about it, but then she'd be extremely quiet when the bad guys were Muslims themselves.  For example during the entire month before the massacre in Paris around 2015 if I remember correctly she was yapping daily about the hardships that Muslims like Palestinians have to go thru everyday, but after the tragedy in the French capital she didn't say a FUCKING word, not even a word of solidarity towards the victims simply cause they were not Muslims. I find her fucking annoying for that. The last few days she's been posting non stop on Facebook about what Israel is doing in Gaza but NOT a single mention of what Hamas has done. NOT ONE.SO FUCKING ANNOYING
Good job everyone. Hamas just laid down there arms and said they quit after watching this.

They're Dutch, and when you fire fireworks at the train station and refuse to leave  a baton is reasonable In usa you'd recive a bullet, in most of the world you would disappear.
If this is genuinely what you believe, I can't assist. It seems illogical to think this way. People in that area often struggle just to get by, and you're suggesting they somehow acquired a quarter of a nuclear bomb? It's hard to fathom how they would access such a dangerous explosive capable of causing widespread harm. Furthermore, if we go by your idea that certain group (Muslims) are skilled in such tactics that they always pull off suicide bombs, how did they miss this time? You need some sense brain-washed kiddo.

Killing white people isn‚Äôt terrorism.
You guys? I‚Äôm not Jewish numbnuts. I just know a terrorist organization when I see one. The hospital? You want to talk about irony? It was a Hamas rocket that killed those people, it had nothing to do with Israel. Maybe people would have a different view on Muslims if they weren‚Äôt so violent and willing to die to kill others. We saw first hand what they do in 2001 with the World Trade Center. Had Bush done what I‚Äôm suggesting back then, there would be over 4,000 more people on this earth today. Kick rocks
Why don't people on Reddit understand protests

Muslims will always seek a temporary cease fire/truce, when they are on the losing end. Gives them time to rearm and change tactics. These people are useful tools.
I will thanks.Also the Jewish faith aren't known to be very tolerant. Spitting at and attacking  non Jews in Jerusalem.  Not to mention the outright islamophobia in isreal everyday. Have I missed anything? Oh yeah. You guys just killed 500 people in a hospital. WHICH IN ANY BOOK IS A FUCKING WARCRIME, plain and simple which ever side your are on. All you have achieved really is creating more "freedom fighters" if you can call them that. I'll go back to my original point it's two side of the same coin.

So sad.  This whole situation is so sad.  Violence begets more violence, and more and more violence. So sad.

Why in America do they think a protest is going to make another country do what they want? are they that full of themselves?
They're not first Gen.

Are you new? Reddit is basically a website with mutlple categories of echo chambers where you can jerk in your circle all day long.
ok the canaanites lived 3000 years ago. your religion still justifies this TODAY. like i said, it‚Äôs feels good watching what they‚Äôre doing to gaza. we needed an updated version of the ‚Äúhow to kill a nation of terror‚Äù handbook.
It‚Äôs more about the rotten food throwing and the poop bucket dumping. And the shame.

If he did throw fireworks in the station and especially at moving trains, this ass whooping is fully justified.
I certainly agree with you. This has evidently gotten out of control, and it's not worth putting our people at risk over "the unlikely hope" that the said python will ever be friendly. It's not and it won't be.
Best thing on Internet today
People are advocating everyone support the care and feeding of the python until it's big enough to strangle and eat us all. No.
Fuck Hamas, fuck the IDF! Stand with humanity!
That's one way to get your furniture to the second floor.

How useless is purple polo?
The boarders flooded. They are in every state by now. But if your not concerned. Just let me remind you. That's what they hope for. Remain vigilant.
I agree but. These people are leading with hate. Hamas means violence in Hebrew. I am not saying trump is perfect but with the two choices given. Americans made the wrong one. Btw I'm Canadian.
call state farm
I‚Äôve never seen Jewish children grow up, join a terrorist organization, go into Gaza and start murdering hundreds of Palestinians. At this point they will never be civilized and need to be neutralized for a safer world of future generations.
Yes. One or the other

Yes. But it's a mouthful.
What‚Äôs happening to this country you can‚Äôt even throw fire works and harass people anymore what is this country coming too
fell asleep im guessing
The haircut deserve all the beating
The thieves by their accents and how they talk are gypsies. They are even saying that they are calling the police and Guardia Civl (Spanish Gendarmerie) themselves lol because the were afraid of the owners.
Can wait to see this on those car crash video youtube channels.
Yes, if I buy a ticket and then when I get there, there are rows of empty better seats, you bet your ass I‚Äôm gonna sit in those seats. So far it‚Äôs never lead to ‚Äúanarchy‚Äù lol. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anarchy for people to go to an event and upon seeing there are many open seats, moving up. The artists/athletes make the same money, the stadium/venue make the same money, it literally hurts no one to sit in an empty seat
Smacking the garbage can with the baton really put her ass in gear.
Those in charge are a direct reflection of those societies who put them there, we cannot lay all the blame at the feet of leaders the way I very often saw people do with Trump, Biden too. While we agree Trump would have been able to prevent and respond to these 2 wars better than Biden, I think a leader that leads with love would far surpass Trump's capacity to help. Therefore the necessary change in our world needs to begin with the people, not relied upon to be instigated by leaders.I wouldn't be concerned about Hamas operatives in our towns but rather all the conscious and unrecognized religious motivation that is at work in modern social reconstruction. What will be the story we tell ourselves as a people and our relationship to eachother and the planet? You and every other individual can help now in the beginning of creating a better world with merely your attitude, the being you put out into the world and the example that sets. World peace is a personal thing.
Right because people understand Hamas is not Palestine - yet Palestine is being punished for the actions of Hamas‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ way more Palestinians have died than Israelis.

They threw fireworks on the tracks. That's also not compatible with European values. It is the fireworks that got them forced out of the station. The whole video is taken out of context
So not only cosplaying but roleplaying?
Oh I‚Äôm not biting on a bleacher tactics conversation.  ;)
Downvoted for the weirdo joker rant edit, yikes bro
They threw fireworks on the tracks, thats why they were forced out
Your morals aren‚Äôt other peoples morals. Stop projecting your beliefs on others.
High ground makes sense if you have weapons or are situated on a hill in a fort, not on bleachers where you can be grabbed and yanked down.

Lines get pretty blurry when the day after a HAMAS massacre in Israel you have "pro-Palestinian" marches.
By this ‚Äúso called Jewish state,‚Äù kisch meer tuchus. The earliest Jewish settlers in Israel are those persecuted, survived pogroms, and forced out of their homelands across the Middle East and Northern Africa. Read up about how Jews were treated in Algeria, Libya, Iraq and Yemen long before the creation of a Jewish state.‚ÄúEuropean colony and ‚Äúapartheid colony‚Äù is crassly over-simplistic and does nothing to bring about peace. There will never be peace until both sides understand that the only way towards it is by both sides peacefully coexisting in their own internationally recognized states.
Europe clearly 'doesn't' have a problem brewing
This happens all over the "democratic" world.Im brazil during 2013 there were protests that would close down the largest venues in our largest city and police/government numbers were so underestimating that they became a running joke to the point where police and government actually improved their measuring.
Rubber sticks: the universal language
You just replied to an explanation of why this would lead to anarchy and you still "who gives a shit". So I'm going to take it that you're one of those people who wants to buy cheap tickets and still sit in an extensive seat.
That... escalated quickly!
Lmao kid handles business
With enough force you can break someones leg with these batons. They're usually steel tipped and the amount of energy transferred into that little tip will absolutely fuck up legs. You can kill people if you hit their head with these. They're not to be fucked around with.
I would say the opposite, hamas instead of idf
Well, the US just vetoed a cease fire proposal in the security council.
its pronounced HAMAS.
on his phone or fell asleep?
What language is this?
Option 3 is wise. But I don't think we have wise ment in charge. Biden is far from wise. If Trump were leading there would have been no war in Ukraine and no war on terror 2.0. For all the hate trump receives we cannot deny. People feared him. An that held the balance of power in check. Biden has shown noting but woke weakness. An we need a leader in the west who is awake not a woke. Otherwise the power will shift. This is what trump supporters were afraid of. Not xenophobia. These Hamas terrorists have cells everywhere now. They wait to hurt you and your family and friends. Even those who support them. They do not discriminate.
Every other video of a fight in a stadiums suggests otherwise. This guy just wanted to talk and then puss out
Belgians: are these cops for hire?
How tf you lose with the high ground.
Dont you guys get tired of repeating the same comments over and over again? Every time someone takes a beating there has to be some comment about adrenaline, it‚Äôs like the ‚Äúthere‚Äôs weight classes for a reason‚Äù comment in fight videos. Like yeah no shit?
Yep, I've seen enough of these stadium fights to know that the idiots on the higher ground are usually facedown and a few rows down after a few seconds, just like this preppy dumbass.
It‚Äôs gonna hurt later for sure though guys.

Came here to say this. He was just eating those things like he was building his rage bar or something.
Where are you in the US Military or Law Enforcement?
Okay, so when the people who have bought them seats get there, they can ask them to move. If they refuse you just go get security. Still not your issue bud
Haha this is exactly where my mind went when I read that. "These damn plebians always coming down here, sitting where they don't belong! Shows how far we've sunk as society, can't even watch my mauling in peace!"
100% agree. Palestine needs to be liberated from their islamist oppressors who are putting so many civilians in harms way.
&gt;I‚Äôll see myself out.You better do, before I get my baton.
Bro was about to get sent to heaven lmao
You are literally advocating for making people have shittier experiences because of a rule that exist purely for corporate greed. You are the reason it's so fucked living in the US right now.
Guy winded too hard and lost his footing, basically turned his arm into a lever and fell over the seats. Being high ground but having to 'red zone reach' for a punch is a disadvantage, contrary to what a lot of people in these comments seem to think. Too much Star Wars and FPS games lol
You sound like someone who has been there and made that mistake or close enough to see someone who has made that mistake first hand.
Well the canaanites no longer exist. So the Lebanese are prob closest cultural split off. But the jews do still exist. Who should have it?
I don't want to take it away from them. For some weird reason you were arguing it should go to who was first and that certainly doesn't lead to the Jewish people.
You feeble mind doesn't understand  this.
It is. Much is not literal. But make no mistake it is historically accurate.
Believe me I know. It's no coincidence that Putin despises zelensky for being a Jew as well. The amount of at Semitic behaviour from uneducated people online is insane.
Protesting has just become a thing you do once because you heard about it on social media the you move on to the next thing
F about and find out ‚ù§Ô∏è
He said there was 30 minutes left in the game. No one‚Äôs been there who fucking cares? If you come to the game at halftime and ask me to move I gladly will. Just mind your own fucking business and watch the game.
Your feeble mind thinks a bible is a history book
Haha nice!
Russians and germans completely removed jews from poland... look up the jewish population there. They have the highest catholic populatuon next to malta its completely possible to remove a people from a country.

Idk about that, there‚Äôs 10‚Äôs of thousands of people there and you think 2 dumbasses represent all of them? They‚Äôre clearly the minority.
Are they your seats? Then mind your own business.
That is exactly the reasoning behind how this all played out.
I heard Isreali soldiers killed a medic helping a terrorist/hamas who got shot and hung the medic on a lamp post 9 hours later. What do you think about this scenario?
That Casper the Friendly Ghost hoody is a sign not to fuck with him

Why do American broadcasters still talk like it's the 1950s?
Rage and fear dictate choices. That's why cops got immunity in most shootings. It's easy to view after the fact but being in that position is different. Think about it you and 5 others surround by 30 ppl throwing big rocks at you. Hurting people. Fear and anger is going take over the fact more ppl don't get shot shows they are professional and trained.Put yourself in their shoes. What would you do? Stand and get hit by rocks, let your friends get hit and hurt? Or would u defend yourself.
FUCK I CAN NEVER GET ANYTHING RIGHT *slams door*
The fifth one made me chuckle, but the sixth made me roll my eyes.

Sir, this is a Wendy's
High ground don't mean shit with stadium seating, it's too high of an incline with no space to operate. As soon as you start to punch you throw your center of gravity downward. Not ideal when all they need to do is grab you and pull you and suddenly you're two rows down trying to make sense of gravity with three boots kicking your face.
I'm not trying to defend Hamas at all, and maybe you have a point. I'm not military or law enforcement. I watched a few documentaries to understand the whole thing. Unfortunately, the documentaries never go into religious lifestyles and practices of people in Gaza. I do have military friends and heard stories about Afghanistan, so I have a general idea of what Isreal is fighting. Technically, America is still at war with terror. Do you think Rage takes out a certain amount of humanity in all soldiers during war?
A fight over seats at a sporting event? Get a grip people! At least if it was over something big, like politics‚Ä¶.
He was about to get the most solid hit XD great reaction speed to stop it
Yeah! Grab an Usher. Maybe a Lil‚Äô Jon too‚Ä¶ or is that Ludacris?

Appeasing didn‚Äôt work. Finish hamas.
It really has. I keep seeing that shitty one sided disingenuous piers Morgan interview get spammed here every day
What a loser
I was. Until you face hostile forces, you have no idea. These ppl don't throw rocks to make a point they do it to harm. So why wouldn't IDF defend themselves? If IDF was so bad, they would slaughter them all.
To gain disapproval, if everyone is talking negatively about it it will lose support. It may not seem like a lot be changing the viewpoint of everyone does a lot
Shame wasn‚Äôt enough. Horse-faced Cunt is more like it.
You underestimate his power
Camera man lame as hell. He was talking all this shit bout hooded dude, calling him goofy ; but when the fight started , he got quiet. Shout out to Lil Hood for standing his ground against a blue falcon/snitch.
Are you military or in law enforcement?
Someone mentioned it in another comment
People who can‚Äôt fight apparently

It is my understanding that almost all these college football games sell out.Obviously not the nobody teams that regularly lose but if the team is even halfway decent it is crazy.I live near a college town where they are a State University and regularly lose to the bigger school in the same state.There is still a waitlist for years to get season tickets and every game is sold out lol.If you noticed in the video, the cameraman mentions that there is only 30 minutes left of a 3 or 4 hour game plus tailgating before for many of the fans.
Bro wtf is it with Americans wanting to shoot all their problems. Too bad you can‚Äôt shoot saturated fats. You‚Äôd win the war on obesity.
You deduced that from this micro-clip?
However they can't even control there own state so why give them more. The Jews have turned Israel into something beautiful again. Why take that away from them.
Meh. That‚Äôs what they want. A few wacks and on their way. It‚Äôs honestly one thing the cops do a lot better in Europe. Not arresting every person who wants to fuck around and find out and overburdening the public with pointless court cases.
Germany is literally picking up people AND dropping it in coastal countries, like Italy, France and Spain
Canada invited too many in and sadly it‚Äôs a big problem. Notice how they all come and tell us we are colonizers .gtfo
But how do they control crowds without the boom stick go bang bang make dead people?
Np that's what I'm here for
Go sports
You can take the approach that it shouldn‚Äôt be allowed‚Äîi.e., by staff‚Äîbut audience members‚Äîi.e., non-employee spectators alongside in the stands‚Äîshouldn‚Äôt be bothered by it when it happens and affects literally no one

Someone dosent understand basic economics. You dont give away free something that is normally very valuable and expensive. If airlines just gave away free first class if there were openings, im sure a LOT less people would buy first class and just hope for the upgrade. Why not? You have a chance at getting it free. They would lose a lot of revenue. For the seats, same applies, AND how are you supposed to regulate that? People would be getting kicked out of seats they didnt pay for all game while people were either arriving late or coming back from the bathroom or something. There are already fights at sports events, this would only increase that. Additionally, you would have an entire (large) percentage of your fanbase that buys the cheapest seats in the house and spends the whole game roaming from section to section sitting in empty seats until the rightful owner comes. Its a clusterfuck. Sit where you paid for. It effects their bottom line and its dumb annoying when I get to my seats and there are already people there. Especially when they try to just squeeze into the 1 open seat next to the ones they tried to ‚Äústeal‚Äù.
I'm watching this like nobody listens to that man in life. "Ain't nothing but space and opportunity"Okay, damn, I hear you.*Man gets his ass kicked by childOh ü§£
sorry did i miss the part where they broke into offices and started chanting for the vice president to be hung? or did they just voice their opinion in a public space?
Why? What are you a stadium owner? Why would you give a shit if someone sits in an empty seat two rows away from you? Lol
I don‚Äôt see why the iron dome is controversial. Offensive weapons, sure. But a purely defensive weapon‚Äôs system, solely produced to shoot down rockets aimed at civilians? What‚Äôs wrong with that?
Yeah but who gives a shit? They‚Äôre empty seats anyways. It‚Äôs wild people give a shit about someone moving into an empty seat to better enjoy the game/concert/whatever
Ban her you mean. From the train station. Hahaha. Yep. Cool stuff. I‚Äôll see myself out.
Recorded that whole time and missed the only punch thrown. Nice.
The game hadn‚Äôt even started yet
Don‚Äôt context me bro! Ahahahhahhahhhhhhhh
Fireworks? In a train station? That‚Äôs a paddlin.
Someone dosent get it at all. ‚ÄúIt shouldnt be allowed but it dosent matter‚Äù. Make up your mind lmao
God forbid someone find a way to ‚Äúcheat‚Äù a multi-million dollar company out of $30.Edit: And they had to buy a ticket to get in. Nobody is sitting there.If the owners of the seats did come in, and ask them to leave, they ought to leave. Staying would be a problem at that point. But not like this. Who freakin cares?
First come first serve? It's not rocket science.......Stuff like this only gets brought up during American sports, never seen or heard of a problem whenever it's been on the opposite side of the pond.If free seats exist why not try your shot at them? Like the guy said nothing but space and opportunity.
It‚Äôs gonna hurt later for sure.

Ironically, Hamas was protesting for an end to the gun violence in Chicago
I feel like the problem isn't that the person called it a jet when it wasn't a jet but the problem is that a lot of people probably died in this
It's free real estate
That‚Äôs gotta be a little embarrassing.Watch the game and don‚Äôt play seat police
I‚Äôm not a trust fund kid, but also not a trailer park kid. I‚Äôm in that nice meaty section where I was born rich enough to not be tough enough to win fights, but not so rich and entitled that I‚Äôm stupid enough to think I can fight.

Europe is so fucked.
People getting asshurt over other seats when they‚Äôre in their own already. I accidentally took a guys seat at a concert back in July (somehow mistook ‚ÄúI‚Äù and ‚ÄúJ‚Äù when looking for my row) I apologized and got up and dude and his wife said ‚Äúrows empty, man. Just sit and enjoy. if we‚Äôre in someone‚Äôs spot, then we can swap seats.‚Äù Really nice guy, unlike these pricks.
Those poor people should make their money the old fashioned way and üé∂get run over by a Lexusüé∂
Oh I‚Äôm not saying it should be allowed, just I think it‚Äôs bizarre to be bothered, not our job to be making sure people are in the correct seats. Maybe they should do an on field free for all before the game and the winners get the empty seats, now that I would pay to see
Jewish kids are tought to hate Palestine from a very young age also. And there's a video of a group of Jewish men celebrating the bombing of a school in Palestine. Its two sides of the same coin. Making your argument absolutely pointless üò¥
Hamas:   ‚ÄúIf Chicago cares so much for peace then they should stop their own shootings.   Anyway‚Ä¶‚Äù
It has to do with "There was peace in Palestine between the locals for hundreds of years under the Ottoman Empire. The only major violence in the region came from people like Napoleon wanting their own swing at the holy land and Egypt invading."It's that simple. Try not to freak out every time someone has the audacity to say something contrary to your world view.
Or maybe just mind your business, enjoy the game
Douchebag, it was a passport from the Mandate for Palestine There never was a country or state named Palestine Cannanites were there over 5,000 years ago
If it was allowed though, imagine all the fans coming down from the nosebleeds to find empty seats. There would be a lot of problems, which is why it‚Äôs not allowed. It would just be a free for all.
HAMAS not Palestine. Hamas has been the minority for over a decade.Hamas took power by force. Palestinians are locked up in Gaza with Hamas. The fact that none of you can even distinguish the difference between HAMAS and Palestine shows your ignorance to the issue. Just don‚Äôt speak on it if you don‚Äôt know shit.
How do you decide which people from the nosebleeds get which empty seats?
If they didn‚Äôt bother them, there probably wouldn‚Äôt have been any riffraff. I do see your point though
Fuckin nerd.
Some people pay for the expensive seats because most of the riff raff is in the nosebleeds. I say this from the nosebleeds.
If no one is sat there then it really does not matter.
Mind your business people
My uncle went through police academy years ago and they were taught that hitting someone their would make the leg collapse. Never seen it work in practice though
Because they weren‚Äôt the ones being aggressive.  Grown adults who paid for their seats shouldn‚Äôt start a fight with some kids who want to steal seats.  The best course of action would have been to get security
Hamas* Hamas and Palestine are not synonymous. Read a book.
Don‚Äôt sit in seats you didn‚Äôt pay for
And hot
dude got his ass beat by probably a highscooler while holding the high ground. clemson fans are NPCs
&gt;Do you just like the idea of the poor people looking down at all the open seats that they couldn‚Äôt afford or what lmao?Yes, this is exactly what people that make comments like him think.
Nooo China i believed in you
I‚Äôll say it a thousand times. Fuck Piers Morgan
Oh so it needs to go to the Lebanese by that logic. Thanks for clarifying
Neither of you guys are alone üá∫üá∏
i think you've watched star wars a bit too many times
If there are open seats, why should people not sit closer? Assigned seats are fair. But if people leave or don‚Äôt show up, you want perfectly good space at an event to go unused?Do you just like the idea of the poor people looking down at all the open seats that they couldn‚Äôt afford or what lmao?I think airlines should give free first class upgrades if there are open seats when they close the doors too.
Bro off his soapbox over here
I prefer ‚Äúonly fear and air, is holding you back‚Äù
Dont you guys get tired of repeating the same comments over and over again? Every time someone takes a beating there has to be some comment about adrenaline, it‚Äôs like the ‚Äúthere‚Äôs weight classes for a reason‚Äù comment in fight videos. Like yeah no shit?
If this makes anyone mad they should reevaluate their life a bit

Cameraman extra annoying and instigating shit but funny fight
When two ideologies who think it is right to exterminate the other meet, their conflict won't end until one group prevails.
At last they act how we all feel, stop allowing them to terroise our cities, if u wanna protest go home!!
Hamas targets children. If Isra√´l happens to kill children it's because Hamas used them as meatshields.
Props to the dude for pulling his punch last minute to not hit the hoodie kid's friend who was trying to stop it
I mean, they‚Äôre arguing over seats, not over anything sports related.
Don't go to a European country as a radical conservative Muslim and throw fireworks in a train station. It's fairly straightforward.
This is an extraneous concept for most people nowadays. Sports + low IQ does that
Someone should have took a swing at the tit holding the camera and shut his ass up.
Yeah sorry, that won't do anything. Sad but true.
Spain
Eyy an acshually in the wild
He's no Obi-Wan.
Because people should care way more about their own faults than the faults of others.
It isn't blind. But it isn't right either.
They just have U.S.A. hostages nbd
People need to calm down you really think the police of the city known as the capitol of international justice would draw buttons for no reason
It is hilarious how completely the American voting public is out of touch with the entire point of protest. They'll march in the streets, but we'll have the same 95%+ incumbency rating we do every election, because they're too timid to do something like primary the politicians stoking the conflict. It's no wonder our politicians just do whatever the fuck they want. The American voting public is a damp paper tiger.
Front loader, not a bulldozer
you should have to take a licensing exam to have children.
Lmao ya goodnews they saw the USA protests and now all of them are hugging and chanting
because people should sit where they paid for    edit: the down votes demonstrate how far we've sunk as a society. Everyone looking for a way to cheat. everyone excusing anti-social behavior.
Why can't we get protests like this for Universal Healthcare or workers wages or gun control or literally anything else that needs a revolution in our country? We've been needing a revolution in the States for many years now, and can't ever get the numbers up. This hurts.
Why did Clemson care? I don‚Äôt understand lol

Then where is the longer version
What are you on about?
Democracy
fI don't think it's a big deal, but if this ever makes you mad, just grab an usher. They will grab security and take care of it.
Your correct. It just may be too technical for the majority of people. Israelite. Simplify for the internet. Not many in this space are educated an even more refuse to live in reality.
Who did Moses steal the land from?
What are you on about?
Huuuge advantage at that
Every white guy of college age is a rich frat kid, according to reddit
Religion should be banned and outlawed. Punishable by expulsion from the planet.
Kindness is free and so is understanding.
Are not all the tribes, the tribes of Isreal? I always took it as Moses and Aaron were of the Levi. I'm open to information. Cognition shifts with new information.
While having the lower ground. Those frat rich kids couldn‚Äôt stand a chance even with an advantage.
Was the cameraman one of the thiefs?  And where did this happen, can't place the accent.
What tribe was Moses from? Where did they settle?
This was a call for ceasefire, not a call to coddle the feelings of SirPoopsiclesMcGee
Well duh. Are you one of those woke people that are just waking up.
How you gonna not beat ass when you have the high ground like that?
I think you mean thank Europe for making it happen, and Christians for keeping it. If it wasn't for evangelicals trying to speed rush to the rapture this couldn't have happened.
Sports fandom is a disease.
This.And boy, oh boy, he won‚Äôt be able to walk tomorrow (or for a couple of days).Adrenalineis a hella of a thing.
Like said before it's not only the IDF that collects information. This area in now under the eyes of the World. Many other parties aren't interested in having this escalating into a bigger regional or even global conflict. Other actors do what they can to escalate.There's an absolute need for volunteer communities and third parties to analyse data and events on this conflict. If you look at the main evidence on this specific matter, it came from imagery of Publicly accessible Web Cameras that captured the Rocket Misfire. This intercept record is not OSINT material but it was processed and verified by our community.
Fucking Nazis Are the worst
its to show solidarity with other humans experiencing trauma.  we are all jaded but at the end of the day we are humans.  too bad we are simply managed by empires and corporations that dont give a shit.  it rarely helps but it shows others they arent alone
It's better to take leg shots than listen to the police I guess...
Agreed. You seem to have a good idea of how to live life. Openmindedness will lead to understanding. Understanding will lead to peace. Unfortunately most people can't get through the first step. Instead they remain trapped in propaganda.
banshee
Yes because anyone in control of that war is watching what people in Chicago are doing lol big waste of time
Good
Europe was stupid before sure but we are wisening up. Places like Denmark and Austria have started deporting refugees who came from Syria. Poland, Croatia, Austria, Denmark, Slovakia are marked black on the refugee guide to sneak into Europe, cuz they take no shit if they cought you are going over the border face first despite shit they get from EU. Unfortunetly places like Sweden and Germany are still supporting letting people with no documents in cuz they are fucking stupid. I have no problem with migrants who are legal and work but refugees mostly middle easteners don't even wanna work but enjoy the goverment money.
Hamas would toss that dude off a roof top if he visited GS.

Maybe if he said it one more time the point would have come across.
Yo watch the whole video. The (Clemson fan) older guy almost punched the other kid who was trying to stop the fight. Pretty impressive he managed to pull the punch on the other kid.
I'm sure they will stop killing in the name of the invisible man in the sky because a bunch of people walked down the street 3000 miles away. Yep that will fix it.
Thank you, it's pretty much what I thought. But it was nice to have such a nice little package. My feelings are even if the supposed jew myth is true, it's a system. Not a people. I'm white, am I to be blamed for the wrong actions of my forefathers? I know I do the best I can as a modern man to be open minded and understanding of all people. What more can I do as I singleton?

Moses was an Israelite.

We know a thing or two because we‚Äôve seen a thing or two.
It is weird but I think its just always been religious. They are the oldest of the Abrahamic religions. So naturally they faced the most trouble with new religions arising.
Thank you, I was wondering what provoked the response.
Sheet, that was fast.
Smh... it's hamas. Hamas is the one doin jihad. Ig they are trying to add a new spin on this and make it not focus on hamas but all jihadist. This would allow them to take out other groups as they pop up. Makes sense.
People say some crazy stuff.
Ain‚Äôt nothing but space and opportunity
You mean that they've had enough and exhausted every possibility, and they have to resort to this? Let's be clear, we've witnessed people from certain parts of the world set public and private property on fire, harm our compatriots, police officers and they expect us to advocate for their right to "peacefully protest"? There's nothing peaceful about these violent demonstrations. I'm tired of witnessing pseudo-progressive individuals spread this inaccurate narrative that Europeans are racists, xenophobes, etc.

No...but they secretly want people to die and in the process turn on Hamas
The tribe of Levi, who are the only ones who can handle the radioactive gifts of the gods? Or am I mistaken?
They said it was Islamic Jihad. That is not Hamas.
Kudos to our Jewish brothers who do not hesitate to oppose and expose the crime against humanity committed in their name by the so called Jewish State, which is not, it is an European Colony in Palestine.Shalom and let get this Apartheid colony down

What the basis for their decision to exterminate then, I'm familiar with yhe propaganda of wwII. Beyond that though. They have been hunted since the dawn of recorded time It seems  weird.

America trying to not get involved in a war ever year since leaving afghanistan: ....... ImpossiblePeace is the only way to distraught America's Military Industry. We must stop feeding this beast. Ohhh when i say peace, I am refering to America staying the bloody hell out of overseas conflicts it profits from.Im starting to get a little worried that history may have been rewritten. This is gonna come off as antisemitic but how do we know that America/ British Monarchy isn't using Jews to colonializing other Countries... Germany was a major part of the British Monarchs plan to further establish its rule by establishing an Idea of Religious Racism. You are taught from a young age that racism is bad. The concept of Religious  Racism is a trojan horse. To accept everybody, you have to accept the horse full of military men going to destroy your cities.The British Monarchy basically stole all the german Castles for themselves. The British Monarchy is evil. Using its german connection through Biden to establish a foothold in the presidency to seize control of America. Now America is taking the Blame for Israel and not them. The British Monarchy own the Saudi Oil pipes and also the Saudi Prince. The holy Cross is symbolism for British Monarchy and always has been.
Yeah they‚Äôre resistant to intelligence ü§£
Brilliant
I think they are standing with the thousands of innocent ppl killed.
Not his first time I‚Äôm guessing.
Politicians see the protests all over the country and start changing their stance. It is politicians in the USA that provide Israel with unconditional support ($$$ and weapons).
Why does everyone keep trying to "exterminate" the Jewish ppl?
Does being fat exclude you from being massive?? I‚Äôm confused by this commentü§£
Those two might not. But I'm sure politicians in the USA can see the large numbers in all these protests which might lead to changing their blind support for Israel.
Rocking that Crocs with a sock on too

You gotta put the /s bro. Idiots will think you were serious and downvote
Social media magnates and populist politicians are happy to help out Putin/China to turn west into an easily controllable oligarchy, hoping that they they will be put in charge of it.
Not going to change a single thing
I don't think Isreal or Hamas gives a fuck about Americans protesting in America.
You figure that out yet. Or is it you who chooses to remain ignorant.
Looks and sounds exactly the same as the strike that hit the hospital
Ceasing to kill each-other is progress to all but the most insane humans.
it is about the 1 minute mark, for all the impatient redditors out there.
Do you even context?!
Token excuse for terrorists trying to act like martyrs. Hamas created themselves, filthy dogs
"That's what happens". Speaking about dumb people.....Learn how to use an apostrophe
They did have wmds tho and went to Syria and later used in attacks on its own ppl but thats another story. Look at the pic of the hospital vs an air strike. Small crater and huge spread of fire. So has to be an incendiary not explosive. Add that to hamas just happening to fire rockets right before and video of rocket crashing... yeah safe to say it was hamas.
They are European cops that have to deal with soccer Hooligans all the time. They do not F around.
It's the brainwashing, he can't help it
It isn't meant to make people collapse or anything, but it really stings, the goal is for people to walk away, not take them down.
Yep
Too bad they don't use billy clubs in the united states anymore
The Pentagon
So the people that oppose you don't like the terrorists and the way you prove them wrong is by throwing explosives at public transport. Seems about right.
WMD's am I right? Lol - "Trust us bro" from the US government is no more trust worthy than idf.
Show them that western women can handle a baton
Yeah adrenalin activated... for now.

I'm contexted stepbro!
Shouldn't be shot for throwing rocks ü§£ you clearly not in military or law enforcement. If 30 ppl are throwing baseball sized rocks or sling shooting rocks they going get put down. You think it's okay for ppl to attack others with rocks?
Can you explain your definition of ‚Äúcarpet bombing‚Äù and how it pertains to the specific application of precision guided bombs?
Pretty sure that‚Äôs just the name Rome gave it when they colonized Judea. I guess history only started with the Ottomans?
They're all baby killer apologists. Just because Israel kills way more of them doesn't make Hamas's baby killing any less evil; baby killers are baby killers.The problem is the amount of people that criticize the baby killing done by one side while defending the baby killing done by the other.
The thing I have come to realize is European police don't often draw their firearms, but good Lord you fuck around and they will help you find out with batons.
Deadpool is so wise
It‚Äôs gonna hurt later for sure
And the DoD conducting an investigation? Look at it how can you say it was an israel attack? No crater
Hamas clearly did it. Look at the impact site. Barely a hole just fire and burnt. So this means it had to be rocket fuel. Hamas will kill thousands of its own ppl and blame the jews because of the ppl who hate jews. And they will be supported for it.
Source
It is truly horrible when a terrorist controlled country kills there onw people.
These police officers are still way more chill than American ones.
Are you implying they are Israeli or Hamas apologists I don't get it
Regardless whether you believe or not. Doesn't change the fact that fighting with the Jews doesn't end well for the opposition. Typically their God works that out for them. That's all the post was ment to be about. You come flying in with some liberal nonsense I don't even think you believe. Clearly your educated. Use your brain.

Ok but your still wrong.
Why you gotta context me bro?
I understand that is the espoused reason, but I don‚Äôt believe it as this body represents the same counties that less than a decade prior had denied Jewish refugees safe harbor.  If I ignore the rhetoric and look to the end result of the action as it‚Äôs motivation I come to my aforementioned conclusion.
But you are bringing it up from antiquity. By saying it's only been their land since this time, and not technically theirs. When it's been their ancestral land longer then the Palestinian people have been a people. So in reality the are reclaiming what they lost, just as Palestinians wish to accomplish. They will not. As I said I believe the Jews have a higherpower looking out for them. They will not be defeated. All who oppose them fail. Not by luck or skill. By faith.
Came here to say this. He was just eating those things like he was building his rage bar or something.

Eradicate yourself first
This audio was released by the IDF, not volunteer communities. The source is absolutely "Trust us bro"
Moving the post, first claim that people don't protest gang violence in Chicago. They do and a lot of us volunteer our time and resources to these communities to try and help. Then move to "well those committing don't care".What's the point in that? Pretty sure if those committing violence cared they wouldn't commit violence to begin with. The point in protesting is to get the attention of politicians in power and to spread awareness of issues. It gives those people living in  those communities an opportunity to voice their opinion on a platform that can be heard.They are doing far more to stem the issues than some redditors trying to be cheeky.
Israel as we understand it, meaning it‚Äôs current configuration geographically, demographically, politically, was founded in 48.  Bringing in Israel from antiquity isn‚Äôt relevant to a conversation about the current material conditions of all this.Which was all I wanted to note with you. Rhetoric about good and evil, or god or destiny are not things that I have any interest in as they don‚Äôt provide any sort of predictive value.
Who would have thought that cosplaying as Hamas could backfire?
These people are fully insane.
The protest isn't for Israel or Hamas it's for our politicians who are blindly supporting Israel's massacare of civilians. We put pressure on our politicians to do things...are you familiar with the idea of protesting?
Fuck the ‚Äúhamas‚Äù orcs they will all burn.
Someone needs to shut that fucking woman up
Empty Green calls this an "insurrection".A bunch of unarmed people not trying to overthrow our democracy, not breaking windows, not beating up cops, not threatening to hang people...just sitting on the floor and asking for a ceasefire.
Are these the same children that throw projectiles at any vehicle or person with a Star of David on them? Even Hamas broadcasts show children chucking shit at Jews in the background. This isn't some sort of Israeli propaganda. The kids are feral.
if they were throwing fireworks then this response seems justified. doing bad shit is bad mmmkk
But plausible context that justifies use of reasonable force doesn't stoke enough rage to be divisive and is therefore useless here. Reddit demands a more interesting narrative than that.
Both sides are, technically, just one is getting them directly and the other getting them second hand from ‚Äòa friend‚Äô

What the fuck is wrong with you? Why do you need to see something ‚Äúbloody‚Äù you‚Äôre clearly a child or a monster
I used to be neutral and mostly thought the whole situation was a "when assholes collide" problem, but more and more, people like you, dancing in the streets if not being directly responsible have completely convinced me otherwise. You probably don't even realize you just said that outloud because you're so used to saying it among other extremists. You've just made an unassailable argument in your "mortal enemy's" defense, and nobody except other jihadists are even ALMOST falling for your "poor terrorist" bullshit.Also, tell your boys to get their shit together. Bombing your own innocents under false flag operations is deplorable, but... Doing it on accident? I'm embarrassed FOR you, and you should be too.
Omg so many palestine flags. Lets throw anti semetism card.
They should tell Hamas to release all the hostages first, is that simple.
Try the hummus?
What I'm seeing here is that protesting doesn't mean much to the people committing the violence (overseas or home)
Lol no
Israel existed long before 1948. How can you be so naive. The land of Israel is like 3000 years old.
Marjorie Taylor Green called these peaceful protestors "insurrectionists".THAT'S how deluded her followers are.
I feel ya. But if 2020 taught us anything, the police will crack skulls in response, looters will show up, and the entire movement will be labeled left wing extremism/terrorism and dismissed.The people feel they have to do *something* in response, and they‚Äôre leaning towards the option which carries the lower risk of hospitalization or jail.The frustrating part is if even a few folks at this demonstration get rowdy or opportunistic, every person there can be assaulted by police and discredited. Hell, maybe nobody is rowdy and they still get assaulted. That‚Äôs happened many times.
" London calling, see we ain't got no swing  Except for the ring of the truncheon thing "
I thought it was supposed to be a safe haven for Jews in their religious homeland. Decided by the UN. Somewhere to feel safe and call home because of not having one due to thousands of years of persecution. Indeed the Palestinian live there. Descendant of the Philistines. Who colonized after the Romans threw the Jews out. So it makes it the ancestral land? Wrong. Just wrong. Read a history book.
Why is this so goddamn funny
Yea you can clearly see they only wanted them out the build
Keep dreaming.
They kidnap more. Close to 200. But Israel bad guy. They are besieging Gaza. It's always Israel fault. Why? Because people do not move beyond emotions. Since people get emotional when they saw children suffering, Hamas did use such feelings to manipulate. They attack Israel, kill 1200. But since therer are not many pictures of it, people forget. Hamas does retreat for tunnels. Then Israel attacks. Plenty videos. People feel pity of children, demand ceasefire. Hamas defense shield. The children.
Seriously, what is protesting in America supposed to do for a conflict on another continent?
If that is Hamas‚Äôs goal it is unattainable, as Jewish people exist as a global group now and not a discreet geographically bound demographic as they did millennia ago.That said Israel as we have understand  did not exist prior to 1948.  It‚Äôs functions was to allow a still bigoted Europe to offload a population they did not want and to establish a beachhead of Atlantic power in southwest Asia to better position itself to challenge the communist powers (specifically the USSR) for control of both oil from the region (as the US had depleted its own reserves supplying the war effort in WW2) and global trade.We‚Äôre entering a point in history where conditions are shifting.  I have no doubt Hamas will be unable to do anything of note to Israel, but I also have no doubt the Atlantic powers, the west, nato, whatever you call it will no longer exist as we understand it by the end of this century. With that structure gone I‚Äôm not sure how Israel survives.
With our thoughts, we make the world.
Just protesting into the void. Something tells me neither Hamas nor Israel gives a single fuck about any of these protests.
needs something man humanity is giving up on itself and in the process it made everyone blind
Well for Russia. Germany changed. In fact I believe they told Turkey and Iran to leave it to Israel. I don't think it needs a good slap. Maybe meditation and some fungi.
Man was taking those leg shots.
Flags changed methods still the same I see what your saying but all of these countries wish to exterminate someone its sickening the world just needs a good slap
Ah yes Soviets no longer exist as well. See. Just leave the Jews alone. Not worth gods wrath.
He wasn‚Äôt justifying anything. He replied with facts that countered factually incorrect statements.Facts do not support the narrative of peace until Zionists and westerners came along.
Yes, plain and simple
Russia did too during Stalins era.  Nazi Germany and Russia were allies before the invasion of USSR less talked about but they are still around. Maybe they wish to be like a Stalin Russia ? would make sense since the left is so eager to back Hamas there is a whole Page on reddit dedicated to this kinda thing you should see the pure insanity of it all.
is that place really called ‚Äúsaturday afternoon open‚Äù?
Not by these Jews
Appreciate the recognition of historical Palestine tho.

I‚Äôd never advocate this, but you‚Äôre probably right. My only question is who will play the Ottomans and genocide everyone who stands in the way of their peace?
First let‚Äôs get a ceasefire in Chicago.
Well you did specifically say one of the worst years ever, so I hope you can imagine where that confusion is coming from.
The lady got the soft wacks compared to the male at the start. As Deadpool said "I'm so confused, is it sexist not to hit you, or is it sexist to hit you..."
They need to call for a cease fire in Chicago.
No genocide here, there was some genocide though a bunch of years ago, something in Germany, I think maybe it why we got here, and why it's pretty unacceptable to have your neighbours want you to not exist. When that's on your country's border you can get on some high horse and protest.
Hamas could be at Rafah crossing, where they told Canadian and American Palestinians to go to be safe, then bombed it. Four times. Hamas was there four times. Hamas is in ambulances, Hamas is in the west bank too! Yeah I know Gazans can't travel to the west bank but Hamas must be there.
Stop saying the media.... as if it is one apparatus.. if you read twitter as THE MEDIA sure
Cry harder
Maybe native Americans should take your house? It is their homeland.
Isreal is commeting genocide and people supporting it . Is just pure evil
Theres no proof if isreali kids being traumtized and killed like the way people in gaza are btw isreal is not even struggling rn they are living fine.
Child is a child
Well one side is using our weapons.
I can sense in your tone how pained you are. I can only imagine how hard it must be to shit yourself this badly. It must be so embarrassing.I pray, for your sake, that Israel does bomb a hospital in Gaza soon, so you can feel a bit of closure when you use it to save face.
So you insult me rather than actually answer the question. Because you clearly don‚Äôt have an answer.
Or maybw u just taking out of your ass cuz u kow nothing about this war and probably a jew
Isreal is not even suffering and this kid in the video is from gaza cuz isreal keeps bombing them .
Ya and that what happends when dumb people like you believe the lies by isreal lmao
By "Americans" I hope you mean brainwashed trustfund hippies who had a super thought provoking lecture while studying for their liberal arts degree.
What has that got to do with the zionist oppression of the Palestinians starting as early as the late 19th century? Are you trying to justify it because some rulers and armies had targeted Jews in some incidents in the centuries before? Are you saying ethnic cleansing is justified because of this?Surely Israel can carpet bomb anyone who‚Äôs at some points treated Jews unfairly then. I live in England so I am not safe.Your sources are nothing compared to the Nabka either. Jews were caught up between local tribes fighting? So unstable for everyone then? Ottomans lent money to local Jews to build a synagogue who then didn‚Äôt repay agreed terms so the synagogue was destroyed and the Jews expelled- this is harsh but again, isn‚Äôt ethnic cleansing. Does not justify the Israeli ethnic cleansing of Palestinians.
I 100% agree with you. You never know where Hamas is going to be. Could be a 3 year old child, they're so so well disguised, so we have to bomb them. Hamas could be a little baby so definitely needs bombing just in case. They could be hiding in the water. Switch off the water. Hamas could be in the electricity so definitely need to switch that off. They're everywhere, so 100% agree. Let's destroy everything that way there can be no Hamas right.
Martyred right in the neck
Cowards firing missiles from afar
These are support beams most likely used on naval vessels I work in a shipyard and see these all the time
You don't know what the term "in cold blood" means. Also plenty of veterans are deplorable people don't just throw that term around to garner sympathy. I'm guessing you're the type to also claim that "if they'd just followed the police orders they'd still be alive." Can't have it both ways.
Ah, yes. Because everyone knows Jews and Muslims were getting along just fine until the Jews had western support.
Jo Biden is complicit in this . just ask for ceasefire and humanitarian aid. alsi there still no real plan to recuse the hostages

We really need to see some more of this. Thank you there is still some glimmer of hope that peace can be achieved
I'm not going to down vote you or chastise you, because I completely understand your sentiment. Can I ask some questions though? Where does the bloodshed lead? What is the final goal that you hope is achieved?
Phffft context. Who needs it? Not these redditors  accusing the police of being worse than Saudi.
So the Israeli journalist was making propaganda by saying a hamas base was destroyed. But as news and videos came out showing it was nothing but civilians he deleted his tweet and made a new one saying it was hamasAnd the idf (Israeli defense force in case your incompetent ass couldn't understand) also did the same thing. Said it was a hamas base, they were proven wrong, they changed tje story. Everyone watched that happen in real time yet your still do stupid to grasp it. Go back to your finger painting project and stay off your phone in class you goddamn 5th grader
Yes living in shit and squalor before being sent to God by an isreali holding a joystick sounds great sign me up.
Because we don‚Äôt have a murder problem like your country that has seen a 12% in murder from last year and a drastic change pre COVID. What‚Äôs the old saying about people in glass houses? Get your facts in order Fox News boyo.

We do have the right to protest, but not inside a government building, especially the capital. You have to do it on public property.But yes violence would add to the charges.

Oh? So after the Arab conquest expelled the Jews around 1300 there was peace on the barren land left over, so that‚Äôs how we should leave it and the Jewish people have zero right to their homeland?
Free Palestine
Hamas is shooting at IDF while wearing civilian clothes. WAR CRIME. Hamas is shooting from civilian buildings.  WAR CRIME. Hamas is hiding arms in mosques and hospitals. War CRIME. How is the IDF supposed to distinguish between combatants and civilians when Hamas are breaking every rule of war?
That's so fake actually there is no evidence that they are even hamas lol
Not Reddit, but various subs, including this one.
Yeah, after terrorists came over and murdered hundreds at a music festival, then went door by door murdering families, Israel is preparing a ground assault. Did you see the video they made of children crying as they executed their sibling? Some folks were just burned alive in their home. Anyway, Israel is preparing the battlefield for a ground invasion to eliminate the terrorists, so they are preparing the battlefield for the war. Hamas has over a hundred hostages, and they use people as human shields. The world would be better if Hamas was eliminated.
They don‚Äôt really understand the concept of a car. This is a a big rock to them, he was t trying to destroy the car he was scratching himself. A big male like this would or could simple flip that car.
is it just me or are plastic chairs and brazil a combo thats happens way to often
Incorrect, but I‚Äôm sure you have a history degree and masters/Ph.D on the subject that makes you an expert not just someone who thinks they are right‚Ä¶. Probably haven‚Äôt even graduated yet lol.
Why arent Chicago marching for a ceasefire in Chicago?
&gt; Those terms are not a realistic 2 state solution or a peace plan. Asking Palestinians to take that deal is asking them to accept the occupation as those terms are basically occupation 2.0. What's not realistic is a side with no leverage thinking they can get a better deal by launching pointless massacres of the population of a state with vastly, vastly superior army. &gt; They'd rather die trying to stop the occupation than accept occupation and ethnic cleansing.You sure they want that? Because I'm pretty sure the vast majority of people really just want to live peaceful lives. Feel free to ask the Arabs citizens of Israel if they prefer suicide bombing the police instead of living their normal lives there.&gt; To your point, I understand the concept of conquest but that usually doesn't entail settler colonialism.15 million Germans were expelled from their homes after WW2 and resettled in the current borders. You can call all the polish people in Gdansk colonial settlers if you want but at the end of the day, when you lose terribly badly in wars you don't have much leverage to work with.Do you think Germans today wished they should've fought on and died instead of accepting occupation and ethnic cleansing from their old territories?&gt;  All other settler colonialist countries genocided the indigenous populations and only now are Canada and Australia coming to terms that they they've done wrong.Sure, but you don't see Hawaiians suicide bombing Honolulu because they got colonized, do you? Yeah, a lot of people got shit deals after they lose wars. Palestine's deal is much better than most. They can keep dying futilely if they'd like. but I've never met a Hawaiian who wished they would've gone the route of Hamas.
Shh, on Reddit it's not okay to talk about the oppression of Jews.
Maybe she should've simply complied....
Tbf it‚Äôs just equipment.
Yea but look at all the terrorists terrorising, they should be all eradicated /s
If it was so peaceful, why were were the Jews reduced to like 5% of the population of the area during Ottoman rule?Maybe there's more to it?https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Jews_and_Judaism_in_the_Land_of_Israel#Ottoman_rule_(1517%E2%80%931917)&gt; [The 17th century saw a steep decline in the Jewish population of Palestine due to the unstable security situation, natural catastrophes, and abandonment of urban areas, which turned Palestine into a remote and desolate part of the Ottoman Empire. The Ottoman central government became feeble and corrupt, and the Jewish community was harassed by local rulers, janissaries, guilds, Bedouins, and bandits. The Jewish community was also caught between feuding local chieftains who extorted and oppressed the Jews. The Jewish communities of the Galilee heavily depended on the changing fortunes of a banking family close to the ruling pashas in Acre. As a result, the Jewish population significantly shrank.](https://books.google.ca/books?id=n_sj-6svy4EC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false)---&gt;  [In 1720, due to failure to repay the debts, Arab creditors broke into the synagogue, set it on fire, and took over the area. The Ottoman authorities held both HeHasid's group and the pre-existing Ashkenazi community collectively responsible and expelled all Ashkenazi Jews from Jerusalem.](http://www.jewishmag.com/4MAG/ISRAEL/israel.htm)--- &gt; During the Peasants' Revolt under Muhammad Ali of Egypt's occupation, Jews were targeted in the 1834 looting of Safed and the 1834 Hebron massacre.Jews were also prevented from visiting the Temple Mount and the Cave of Patriarchs, why was that?
Who the fuck are you protesting to? The only way your government is getting a cease fire is by helping Israel beat Palestine into the ground
Why‚Äôs the point?
A lot of people always need to use -ism's, -isve's or other polarizing terms for them to be able to understand the world because nuance is very hard and complex for them.
100% agree. I can't support either side, but on a world stage, it looks bad even sidding with the Islamic state in palstine and is a safer bet backing the Jewish state of Isreal. I find it fucked when the only solution is bomb the terriosts but you can't even trust the IDF not to say fuck it and just kill citizens for no reason which has happened.
I don‚Äôt see any guillotines in the crowd do you? I also don‚Äôt see anybody attacking officers or smashing windows trying to break in, do you?
Those terms are not a realistic 2 state solution or a peace plan. Asking Palestinians to take that deal is asking them to accept the occupation as those terms are basically occupation 2.0. They'd rather die trying to stop the occupation than accept occupation and ethnic cleansing. To your point, I understand the concept of conquest but that usually doesn't entail settler colonialism. All other settler colonialist countries genocided the indigenous populations and only now are Canada and Australia coming to terms that they they've done wrong.
You forgot the part where senators and representatives ran for their lives while they destroyed and smeared shit all over the walls of congress . Also these people were all removed and arrested.
That's a pretty good deal for a side that has lost countless wars over the years and has basically no leverage left. By your logic, Japan should've kept on fighting after getting 2 nukes dropped on it because an unconditional surrender is such a shit deal.
I bet they'd say:  {"My great^n grandfathers stole your ancestors land" is also a pretty shit claim to land}
Now because of this video being posted there will be 20 people who don‚Äôt know any better spreading the same bs. OP you‚Äôre to blame for spreading your low IQ to others.
Every time. I remember being at a rally in San Francisco in 2001. The news said 10k and it was more like 60k.
Palestine: throws punch at bigger guy Also Palestine: timeout, fight is over!
Ceasefire or extermination of jews?
They were lucky enough to have that area along with many other pockets within Israel in the first place. It was back in Bush‚Äôs years Israel moved their military out of these areas to give them their own territory. That‚Äôs what the people asked for and Israel did just that to hopefully bring peace in that area. Once Israel cleared out it created a vacuum for these psychotic murderers to form their own ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù with they intent to kill as many Jews as they can. They tried to be reasoned with, it didn‚Äôt work, at this point Israel could soak a nuke in pigs blood and drop it on them and I wouldn‚Äôt have a single afterthought. After they are dealt with, move on to Iran (who clearly helped them) and do the same to them. Enough is enough of these clowns.
if  you attack a synagogue its no hatred of israel, but hatred of jews - otherwhise they would have went to the embassy
Naw when we see this type of level of aggression from one side, it‚Äôs time to eradicate them from the planet. Clearly Hamas didn‚Äôt get the Intel on their own, they‚Äôre clearly being backed by Iran. We‚Äôve reached a point where if you‚Äôre going to go on these mass killing sprees, it‚Äôs time for you and everyone else with your ideologies to exit the earth. These Palestine children are being taught at schools, at a young age, to hate Jews. They are breeding them to become soldiers to kill as many Jews as possible. I‚Äôve seen videos of Palestine children spitting on a woman‚Äôs dead body that Hamas brought back with them. Total disregard for human life and clearly young killers in the making. There should be no more tic tac bombing on certain areas trying to kill as many Hamas as possible, it‚Äôs time to level the entire area and make the world a safer place for future generations.
I couldn‚Äôt believe people were out cheering and chanting free Palestine after the 10/7 attack. Did they not know the Likud was going to do? I figured people that cared about Palestinians would‚Äôve been afraid, scared, in shock‚Ä¶ not cheering. I fully support the right of self determination for the people in Gaza and the West Bank, but they need a leadership that wants that more than they want the destruction of Israel.
Nah I'm sure the Israeli and Hamas are really rethinking their actions because of protests in the USA.
Israel already did just that. When Bush was in office he (pretty much) pressured Israel to give the Palestines land in which they did pulling their military out of Gaza and other pockets within the country. That was suppose to appease the Palestines and give that sector peace moving forward. Well clearly it wasn‚Äôt good enough and when Israel drops their guard, Hamas comes in on a genocide crusade. There comes a point where no matter what someone does or says, it will never be good enough. It‚Äôs time to end these groups for good and eradicate them and anyone like them from the world to make this a better place for future generations.
They absolutely did not.
Some of the most prominent anti-Israel figures, such as Norman Finkelstein and Noam Chomsky, are Jews. Jews‚â†Israeli government
I'd rather not see her stripped naked thank you.
You see I‚Äôm a lil high. But Ty lol
*random israeli turns on TV* welp, gotta stop the war guys, look at Chicago, they‚Äôre demanding it! *war ends*
Always one crying victim
Stolen land don‚Äôt mean nothin in this world tbh. Also before u try to straw man me please notice I never used the we lived here before so we should live here now argument
Crazy move actually. They were like where do we hold this and someone said right in the middle of these dead people.
Peace offers for stolen land? Yeah, okay.Look buddy, "my ancestors lived here 5,000 years ago, so I'm taking all your homes" is a pretty shit claim to land.
It also wouldn‚Äôt be an issue if Palestine would accept any of the peace offers given by Israel.
Imo hamas and his plan was to do the attack and then go- oh look big scary Israel is hurting poor little Palestine and gain support from not so much the Arab countries who wouldn‚Äôt rlly care bc they‚Äôre at war with each other already and primarily Europe and the Americas because those people there have nothing to pay attention to because Ukraine went out of headlines after like 3 months and only comes back every once in a while. Doesn‚Äôt help the news is jumping on tho gs without the facts. For example the ‚Äòhospital targeted‚Äô wasn‚Äôt targeted and an Israeli defense minister came out and said the missiles they use would‚Äôve leveled that hospital if they wanted. After which the news changed the story to building near a hospital was bombed. Not saying Israel is free of fault here just sayin hamas is taking advantage of the news jumping on things when they don‚Äôt have all the facts. Same thing happened with Ukraine in the beginning they were saying Russia was gonna wipe out Ukraine in weeks and now it‚Äôs been over a year and Ukraine has stayed strong
Chicago city government may be able to negotiate an accord between leaders on both sides.
Hamas did this.
Wait, where is the bar?
It only takes one Veto to stop the UN from taking any action. That's why it's a completely useless institution.
Well that's not nice..don't be mad I me..I didn't do anything to you!
I 100% support all innocent men, women and children
Yeah this didn‚Äôt turn out to be true. Swing and a miss.
Nah you guys are just stuck in the Middle Ages where you think you can just waltz in and take land and homes from people who been living there for generations.
they've cut water, food and fuel to 2.4 million people for 2 weeks, trapped in one of the most densely populated areas in the world being carpet bombed nonstop. This type of blatant violation of all geneva convention/internation law is unprecedented in modern history.
Twice you've made these exact two comments. Copy and paste job from your Hasbara office?
West Bank Palestinians have no voting rights in Israel. The Israeli guy who lives right next door does though. Please explain how that isn't textbook apartheid?
Shhhh you‚Äôre making too much sense for Reddit. Now go back to your naive cynicism!
I would say that most people don't know the name of the hospital that was bombed and the words second angle imply that it is.. well the second angle of that original bombing.The whole residental building thing is a good point, but based on the comments in this thread most people seemed to think it was the original bombing at first, so the title must have mislead them to some degree.
I know this will shock some people, but the land of Palestine was relatively free of conflict between the Fall of Acre in 1291 to the battle of Gaza during WW1 1917. During the Ottoman and Mamluk era, which lasted 500 years, twice as long as America has been a country, was relatively peaceful until the British arrived and decided to make a mess of things.

Idk. It says al-Quds not al-Ahli. And it says residential building. And, it's been a day since any pertinant video of the explosion has been published.
Gotta always be participating in something and posting it to instagram or I no longer exist within other people‚Äôs minds
You can't blame them, the title is worded in a way which heavily implies it is the bomb that hit near the hospital that people have been talking about the last few days. Blame the OP for misrepresenting the video with a purposefully(?) misleading title.
Damn Chicago doing something good other than jam up traffic with motorbikes and car whipping around in huge crowed circles? No way!
You‚Äôre damn right.
The protester looks like he came in his pants when he was on the ground.  Lol
Just like insurrection
they‚Äôre protesting US support for Israel‚Äôs genocide. and zionists have only been colonizing Israel for a little over a century. ‚Äúthousands of years‚Äù reveals you know nothing more about this than glancing at headlines. your smug cynicism is empty
I have no idea what Hamas thought they were going to accomplish with theirs attack or what they thought their end game would be. They had to know how Israel would react.  They must have thought (and maybe were led to believe by Iran) that the rest of the Arab world would rally to their cause and end Israel.  They may still believe that. I don‚Äôt think so. I wonder if the Russians were pulling strings through Iran to deflect attention and resources from Ukraine.  It‚Äôs terrible that innocent people on both sides are suffering for no good reason. They all need to put the past bed and learn to live peacefully together. This will set that back by another generation.
I thought that was odd. I paused and did a grid estimate of a zoomed in shot of one small section.There were roughly 350-400 people. The wide view shot was way, way more than 1000.
Hamas wouldn't be an issue if Israel didn't annex/steal land, literally kicking people out of their homes to give them to Israeli civilians.
I wonder why they weren't shot in the head Babitt style
Awareness.Media coverage reaches more people in the USA and potentially other places in the world. That causes people to wonder what they are doing and hopefully educate themselves. More people talking, posting, and generally giving attention to an issue can lead to more government attention on it.Some people write to their Congress members. Communities put pressure on elected officials. It's a long game with varied results.The squeaky wheel gets greased. Without noise, no one cares to do anything. Be constantly loud while interrupting the normal flow of society, and someone will get annoyed enough to do something about it, for better or worse.
They need to worry about a ceasefire in Chicago first.
&gt;Can anyone tell me what the best case scenario is for one of these protestors?The same thing it is for every protest that isn't large enough to make demands yet, to shift public opinion primarily. Are you totally unfamiliar with the concept of protesting? &gt;Isreali leaders see a protest in Chicago and cease-fire? Is there a planned outcome or is this just screaming at the sky?"Just asking questions" then, got it.
Why didn‚Äôt they just‚Ä¶drive away
I mean if this is true. I‚Äôd understand. If people came to the US and started killing innocent people and families. I would be in a blind rage. Fuck the geneva code at that point.
&gt;If they want a cease fire, they'll have to wait another 200 years.There was peace in Palestine between the locals for hundreds of years under the Ottoman Empire. The only major violence in the region came from people like Napoleon wanting their own swing at the holy land and Egypt invading.The narrative of this being some ancient conflict is inaccurate. Violence only started when Zionists came in large numbers to have their own try to retake the holy land and the British helped them do it while lying to the Muslim population with promises they had no intention of keeping.
Seriously, isn't it cute that regardless of how many people are protesting in America that they think they can stop this war that's been going on for thousands of years.
We can compare numbers to past events, but we are meant to learn....I guess not!
And same people said Israel bombed the hospital, then abruptly gave up that line when it turned out a rocket misfire from inside Gaza caused the damage.
Literally ü§£ they would be celebrating still if Hamas had the same military equipment as Israel
I love how war protesters get told crap like ‚Äúthat might be more than 1000 people‚Äù while the picture you‚Äôre looking at clearly shows 5-10k people.
They get to make a sick Instagram post showing how socially aware they are
Al-Ashli Ba'abbit attempted to climb through a shattered window and was martyred. /s
There are Jewish people protesting this in Israel, too. People protested the Iraq war and the Afghanistan war in America after 9/11. People with morals protest injustice everywhere. Just because you have no qualms committing genocide doesn't mean others don't either.
So they won't face repercussions in their professional life. There's also the whole "I am Spartacus" aspect.
i dont think he has a time line because he ask me to learn history when he never learned history him self
Why are people supporting terrorists? Right after footage of them executing civilians and gunning down families is show all over the web. I mean wtf is wrong with these idiots, their morale compass is so far fucking gone and should be treated harshly.
it obviously isn't
Is there many practitioners though? I know Snipes is one of them.
yeahhh‚Ä¶no way there going to get a cease fire after oct 7.
I like how dude went all Lui Kang with the flying kick.
and this does not account for the billions spent on the iron dome.
sir, i think a greater argument is the 30billion under bush and the fact that its 3.8 billion yearly now until 2028
are ninjas antifa?
Hurt people Hurt peopleAnd the majestyOf this tragedyIs the preciousKnowledge ofOur own selfDestructionFormatting edit*
The goal is to get the US to not veto the UN ceasefire
I got nothing to add but Lol your username is a literal phrase used in the literal crusades. Ironic.
Hell isnt below, it's right here with us.
I believe the Israeli propaganda machine refers to them as "self hating Jews"
Why would they care if a bunch of people block off Chicago? Asking for honest answers only
lol ‚Äúinformation from 2014‚Äù. Any other sources to corroborate? Or even from this decade?
Biden will see the headline and move on with his day. Netanyahu will probably never know this protest even happened.
So the complete extermination of a people funded by US tax dollars. Non-combatants are being slaughtered , levels of engagement should be familiar to you mr jarhead. It‚Äôs sickening that condemning the death of innocents is questioned
That‚Äôll show em. ü§®
Can anyone tell me what the best case scenario is for one of these protestors?Isreali leaders see a protest in Chicago and cease-fire? Is there a planned outcome or is this just screaming at the sky?
&gt;I wonder where was this protest when the us bombed the shit out of the entire middle east for a decade?You weren't paying attention--or maybe you were and are just being disingenuous. There were many many *many* protests.
Man that was on her lol. Like dude gave her fair warning. Deff not cold blood. But he did kill her thats for sure
I guess they shouldn't have attacked every Arab country that has given them refuge and rejected every peace plan. I keep hearing elections have consequences and someone voted in and continues to support a group that refuses to acknowledge the right to exist.All that is water under the bridge though, a line has been crossed and now the time of Gaza in it's current form is coming to an end.
You have just won a ticket to.. GAZA.. bye.
This is an excellent point. Hamas or not, Israel is still running an apartheid government because they will not risk even the possibility of a state that isn‚Äôt majority Jewish. They want a religious state without anyone noticing the ugliness that comes with this form of systemic overt discrimination. We‚Äôve all seen the settlements, the theft, the abuse. They can argue they have a right to go after Hamas, but to say that Hamas has caused all of this is absurd. This began long before Hamas existed.
First off fuck Hamas but given your question I legitimately think you might have been born yesterday and so I'm wondering how a 1-day-old baby is capable of posting on the internet.
Absolutely terrifying! I can‚Äôt even imagine foi going through that.
Lol seriously those are the most gentle cops I've ever seen.
If they want a cease fire, they'll have to wait another 200 years.
He is biased
Rubber dinghy rapids, bro
The cope is so hard üíÄ
There has never been a state of Palestine.Prior to the creation of Israel there was a mix of jews, christians, and muslims living in the area that is now Israel and it was under British rule.If the Palestinian people hadn‚Äôt been so belligerent, there would now be two thriving countries in that area rather than one thriving country and an apocalyptic hellhole.Not really a surprise given how intolerant Islam is as a religion.
Israel has blatantly disregarded the safety of Palestinian civilians for decades. That is the main reason people protest
Seriously?
Welcome to real ordinance. If Hollywood used the same amount of charge for their explosions, well there would be a lot of limbs flying. Crazy though seeing real shit in higher quality footage.
Male elephants are remarkably territorial and con be very dangerous. I would never be that close or not drive away. What did they think was going to happen?
If you downvoted me I fully support the Israelis here. I'm just asking dumb questions because the "Gaza is the victim" crowd overpowers logical thought on reddit.
No freedom of speech and expression comments today huh, if video was from india or Brazil or russia amerikan would be losing their brain
Keep absolutely still. Its vision is based on movement
Yeah, so Israel claims. Definitely not with that force. Plus hamas doesn‚Äôt even have access to bombs of this level
Because the US always takes Israel's side and because Israel will not adhere to a ceasefire until hostages are released and Gaza is back under Israeli control. My comments keep getting hidden but you people are delusional. None of you seem to understand the history of the region, and how Gaza is structured by Hamas to put citizens in the middle of military operations as human shields, so that it can manipulate the media to make Palestine's own barbaric actions look like Israel's doing and responsibility. Israel cares more for Palestine's citizens than Palestine does, but when you have a antisemitic protests being cheered on by young Americans, you've lost their ear and willingness to consider any outside countries opinions on their actions. The UN can try to push a ceasefire but Israel won't obey it, so the US will continue to veto it in order to avoid a massive conflict in the UN.
protesting is supposed to make a change, protesting in the wrong country does not make a change
70 years ago Palestine attacked Israel and lost and they‚Äôve attacked more or less continuously since then. Did you really think Israel would still around singing kumbaya with their attackers?
I agree mostly with what you said, but I‚Äôm not a fan of nuance. I want strong laid out positions that make sense. I want a policy of ‚ÄúDo XYZ or we will do ABC‚Äù. It needs to be clear, fair, and followed through.
Have you actually taken the time to read the peace plan proposed in the 2000 camp David summit? -West bank land grabs (9:1 ratio land swaps)-Giving up Al-Aqsa mosque-Airspace still controlled by Israel (indefinitely), -Palestinian refugees are not allowed to enter.-West Bank divided into 4 segments with Israeli territory dividing them Does that sound like a fair deal to you? Does a state that can't control its own airspace, fragmented in pieces sound like a country to you? Israel was never interested in a 2 state solution in these peace deals and only offered terms they knew the Palestinians would reject.
I absolutely agree but our foreign policy doesn‚Äôt tend to leave that much room for nuance. Which is an absolute failure of the US government. It will take somebody actually getting through to the Israeli government that there hardcore stance on the defense of Israel is spawning more actors against then than it‚Äôs destroying. Israel is also constantly giving Hamas what it wants.Reasons to call the Israel‚Äôs war criminals to tune the rest of the world against them and to encourage more of the people of Gaza, Palestine, and the Arab nation as a whole to radicalize and join there fight. I dont see anyway the region could have long lasting peace with the existence of Hamas and Israel together As Americans we know the cost of a war on terror. We know the difficulty of trying to collapse a terrorist cell. Only time will tell. At this point neither side or at least Israel isn‚Äôt ready to even open a line to even have a discussion or demands of what peace is like. All we can do right now is pray for the live of the innocents on both sides and hope that steps are taken at least at the end of this to ensure at least a longer lasting peace.
Are you really that uneducated? Look up the crimes Israel have committed against Palestinians for the last 70 years. Absolutely vile country.
Yes cause Hamas will just stay behind with a Bugs Bunny bullseye on them.
This is going to turn into a Leopards ate my face situation for these protestors.
This mindset is part of the problem. It doesn't have to be that complicated - just stop shooting and bombing for a period on both sides so innocent people can move about without being murdered.  Don't bomb an evacuation attempt or purposely attack civilians - it's actually very very simple to not be a total psychopath.
They voted them into power in the first place so not really that hard to answer
Nah chief nothing serious they just murdered 1200+ of our people on the 07.10 and kidnapped 150+ people into gaza, but they are all israeli so who cares
as they should Hamas started it.  here is a idea maybe next time not go on a killing spree. nobody likes to hear you whine when you start something.
Damn Hamas must've missed another rocket...
Biden puched the Kaiser right in soup sucker back in WWI jack!
The fake groaning and flailing is so cringe
Hamas is just fulfilling the purpose Israel created them for.
All these protests die a cease fire won't stop a war between two different counties, actual bozos
*Hamas's bombing of...Fixed it.
How many Palestinian lives is a Israeli life worth?
Yes the massacre of Palestinians that already has more deaths of innocent lives.
If you can't tell the difference between this and an armed mob kicking out glass and climbing through doors trying to capture representatives I dunno what to tell you.the Ashli Babbitt video is funny to me in a sad way. the height of entitlement meets a restrained but inevitable FAFO. the death count of her buddies could have been much higher than just her. they got off easy.
We literally vetoed a ceasefire today
How many Jews need to die in order for you to feel like this is a fair conflict?
Amen Because only Antifa wears masks
Congress was not in session in that building. No cops died. There is no damage to the building. They weren't trying to overthrow the US government.Why would they spend 20 years in prison?What a silly thing to say. You have to do better.
Seent it. Now list how many unarmed civilians were brutally murdered on video in a single incident in Palestine. And correlate that with exactly when these protests began, because it sure looks like they were in direct response to that massacre.
I care more about Jewish children dying and I care more about Muslim children being killed than if a mosque is torched or a synagogue is burnt down.
Why do you care?
Why is it up to Israel when Hamas started the war?
Check this site out. Should paint the picture on who kills who. https://www.ochaopt.org/data/casualties
Propaganda go brrrr
Biden created Israel?
Hennything is possible
Now THAT is antisemitic
She's probably like, your boos mean nothing. Cuz she doesn't care. Politicians care about power and money, the people they supposedly serve are not even a concern for them.
The social terrorist group was organized and funded by the israeli government in the eighties. As well as armed by the u s government. It's one of those situations where let's create a group so we can fight later down the road. Sound familiar?
When our country gives billions in aid every year to an occupying force, yes it is our responsibility.
Is this an insurrection??
Well they use stupid religion to justify ethnic cleansing
People are anti Nazi not semitic
And no windows broken, no doors caved in, no police pepper-sprayed or injured, no Congressional office burgled/trespassed/vandalized. Amazing that folks can actually protest at the Capitol and conduct civil disobedience without trying to topple the government.
In some ways, west bank has it worse. IDF soldiers randomly bust down doors in the middle of the night, in a tactic that is known as making their presence known. They have their crops randomly sprayed with. They have daily encounters with crazy gun wielding settlers, who could take their life at any moment and never suffer any consequences.
Hamas: kills a thousand Israeli civilians, kidnaps more, hides behind Palestinians to avoid retributionIsrael: retributesAmericans: nooooo you have to cease fiiiiiiiire
I would prefer not to live in a world without hummus (sorry)
same people that were celebrating on oct 7
You're pretty stupid. The United States is one of the few countries that can apply enough pressure to convince Israel to negotiate a potential cease-fire. It won't because Israel is the tail wagging the dog but it could, if it wanted to.Anyway, protests are sometimes understood to be almost certainly futile but that doesn't make them irrelevant.
Some areas were granted limited self government, very similar to the current situation for Palestinians actually. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bantustan
Why dont you mention the other statistic?
The US gives massive funding and weapons to Israel.  Whom I imagine this guy is protesting. They also have other protests there all the time. I‚Äôve seen pro Ukraine protestors when we are already helping although they want more support.
This is pretty stupid. Only Americans are stupid enough to think that this is our governments responsibility or that Hamas gives half a shit what westerners think about anything.
What about something simple like trespassing?
&gt;Israel has received more foreign aid from the US than any other country since WWII. The United States committed over $3.3 billion in foreign assistance to Israel in 2022, the most recent year for which data exists.They are not the same.
What really pisses me off is I'm not even the most astute person at all, but even I knew that it was ludicrous to report such varying large numbers so quickly, or to report a hospital was levelled WHILE REPORTING FROM INSIDE THE HOSPITAL. They were really pushing the number 500 a lot, a nice round number for them to push, way before it would have been feasible.
They are saying ‚ÄúNot in our name‚Äù [those are American Jews protesting for a ceasefire.](https://www.wbaltv.com/amp/article/protesters-take-over-congressional-building-ceasefire-gaza/45576372)
Courage.
They're not saying "I saw this thing, trust me that it happened".  They're posting an analysis of videos, photos, and commentary that other sources have posted and they cite what they're referring to.  Read through it and come to your own conclusion about what most likely happened.This attitude of "I'm going to wait for somebody to tell me what to believe" when there's footage out there worries me.
You got to learn to love and forgive.
Are they progressive, or just normal people who care about humanitarian issues?
Shut up you clown
West bank Palestinians are not allowed to participate in government They have separate roads, separate licence plates.It's apartheid.The west bank is the Israeli Bantustan.
It looks like the realization that the people he trusted to protect him used him as a human shield. Once again these innocent kids would stop dying and being in harms if these so called warriors of God would stop hiding behind women and children and come fight in the open. Oh wait they only attack peace festivals and civilians going about their lives. Slaughter children and women. Behead babies, rape girls. Burn family's alive in their cars. Set houses on fire so people come running out their safe rooms just to be met with 7.62 machine gun fire. If this is what you do In The name of God, you have no place on this earth. Do you think HummASS GIVES A FUCK ABOUT THAT CHILD!!!! I CANT WAIT TILL THEY ARE ERADICATED.  fucking scumbag terrorists.
This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúfreakout.‚Äù This is normal.
They did veto a call for ceasefire in the UN Security Council though
What she did?
Because she should know

Crazy how many people upvoted such a dogshit comment
Insurrection?
The U.S. can't control and defend their own capital.Let alone one in another country
They remember they just think it was good
Both Hamas and Israel are terrorists.Yet only one side gets the US unconditional support.
Holy fuck. That does not look like the movie explosions at all. That's unreal. Those poor human beings.
The US gives money to both sides and has for a long time "Since April 2021, the United States has provided *over half a billion dollars* in assistance for the Palestinian "
It‚Äôs definitely trendy right now
"Airstrike of a tower next to Wahid's Kebab" just doesn't have the same kick to it
O, sweet baby Jesus! I was listening the police scan, some months ago and the cop asked for medics saying: "Could I get a 24 (medic) for my code 3 (detainee). She's screaming she can't breathe." I swear I could hear the annoyance in the voice of the cop.
No a police officer killed a traitor and a dumbass who didn't listen to instructions with a gun pointed at her.
If there's a ceasefire especially without the release of hostages, and Hamas in power Palestinians will continue to be screwed for generations. They'll be more bloodshed and attack and horror committed on Israeli people and Palestinian people. Hamas guaranteed the only path forward is their defeat. Their goal isn't peace it's killing all Jews even at the expense of the Palestinian people.I want a ceasefire and peace as much as anyone but that isn't the reality of the situation. Hamas isn't going to give up arms and suddenly use diplomacy to help the people of Gaza.
bUt iTS aN iNsUrReCtIoN!
You say "lets" like there's anything he can do about it lol
Exactly, as a human (at the very core of this) we can all see this child's pain. And if u act like you don't you are lying. Isreal has children that have been taken and killed as well. Does that mean that the pain in this kids heart is any less? No. It doesn't. People need to stop saying " well I bet this side did this, and their kids suffered this" for fucks sake grow up. Should either side feel this? No. God damn or Allah or whoever you fucking turn to when things are terrible or great, is that a world that should be normalized to a point where you don't feel for a small child? If so I don't Wana be a part of it
*Forget it protesters she has the high ground*
That's because they whole heartedly believe that the civilians who got killed in Israel deserved it.
Did these people forcibly break in to the US Capitol? No? Well, there‚Äôs your distinction.
Theres a video of a shelter full of people Hamas found, they three a grenade into it, the room was covered in so much blood and the bodies looks like dead animals on an abattoir
hummus
&gt;American made defense equipmentNow let's talk about the offense equipment.
Ironic they downvotes facts and call you 'ignorant', yet have no factual basis for their own position.
Oh thank God, i trust him far too much already
It's J6 part 2!
This guy is amazing
You can storm the capitol no problem, but you can't ask for peace
One of the few enjoyable videos I‚Äôve seen amongst all the outrage and gloom and sorrow. Satire has a way of making you think outside your comfort zone without getting mad at the satirist.I strongly  recommend people seek out and watch the entire interview.
Good luck. Biden is so old he fought in WW2 against the Nazi‚Äôs and helped to create Israel afterwards.
Brother, Al-Jazeera broadcast video of the PIJ rocket misfiring and hitting the hospital. No BS sound analysis required.
Bunch of anti-Semite‚Äôs! /s
They is plenty of stuff to protest about. Just never happens for some reason.
Does anyone have a link to a video of the Al-Ahli bombing? All I‚Äôve seen so far is a scorched parking lot with no crater.
A+++
And by ‚Äústorm though it violently‚Äù, we mean busting windows, breaking down doors, attacking and killing officers with flagpoles, stealing property, and forcing your way into Congressional chambers
I wish whoever downvoted my post would be willing to post why they disagree. I don‚Äôt mind downvotes, but why not engage in discussion? Maybe I would learn something to help alter my proposal.
And yet it‚Äôs the reason why this is not Twitter, or X or whatever, which is a total dumpster fire.
Nice of them to assume she has the capacity for shame
Can somebody put some mariachi band music over this. Would be mint lol
[are you seriously forgetting what January 6th was like?](https://youtu.be/Iludfj6Pe7w?si=52SAZZmKXYLt1j8d)These two situations are nowhere near similar
Shalom, folks! Capitol's the stage now! üïäÔ∏èüáÆüá±
Which is why there must be a major change in US policy towards Israel. Support them from those who desire to have them destroyed but not with a blank check to do evil themselves. Peace can not be hoped for if we allow Israel to antagonize and be the aggressor against the Palestinian.
Or maybe he witnessed his father beheading a hostage.
I don‚Äôt care who this boy is, what side he‚Äôs on, or who is responsible for his pain - NO child should have to go through this. This is heartbreaking.
That‚Äôs how I feel and Israel and America have made there stance clear isreal belongs to the Jews. And and they have the full might of the us military behind them. U.S. foreign policy is to treat them as a member of nato
Can't wait for them all to get decades in prison for this insurrection!
Just drive away you idiot! I've driven in Kruger, they're just morons.
Excuse me for recognizing a sound that I've heard over and over for the past two years blowing away Russians in Ukraine.Day by day it's getting harder and harder for you people to run deflection.  I will say you are better than the normal Russians that just hang out here and downvote everything opposing their side. More numerous at least.But you still stick out.
"An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind."
If the GOP can get its shit together, item number one on the agenda is giving a bunch of money to Israel.
 85% of Republicans support Israel and the majority of Democrats.

[cease fire!](https://youtu.be/NZqh0XOpkf4?si=Qnb3iqFX39TVnmar)
A synagogue in Tunisia was burned down and four people killed (and another synagogue threatened with destruction by the mob) as retaliation for the hospital.  But it was a Hamas lie from the start.  Even with this new information they will believe forever Israel did it and not listen to the truth.
Facial recognition software.
&gt;Do the Gazans support Hamas?Tough question to answer. And even if they do, it seems harsh to mete out punishment against everyone who lives there. Like how many people even vote? How many weren't even born when hamas took power. Very sad.
It easy being progressive when youre an ocean away all safe and sound in your liberal American bubble haven. Being Jewish is Not the same as being Israeli, they know exactly jack shit on life here, war or not. Let's see them being progressive when theyre actually living in Israel and their 12 year old sister and their grandmother are marched in the street to cheers from the crowds and then held captive in Gaza. Bet none of them watched any israeli babies throat slashing videos. I wonder where was this protest when the us bombed the shit out of the entire middle east for a decade? Gtfoh
Yes! My husband had just told me someone got shot in front of the smoke shop, then I opened Reddit and this was the first thing I see..crazy üíÄ
LOL, the capitol police officer rightfully killed a treasonous piece of shit for trying to upend a fair election while they were breaking through a baracade to get to protected members of congress conducting business.
Unfortunately, until the GOP gets their collective heads out of their asses and agrees to elect a speaker that's not Jim Jordan, the USA can't do anything.
Who is behind all this https://youtu.be/RG9yDgl0xgw?si=6tPX2VAo3mdWneoi
Didn‚Äôt realise the discussion of Neymar‚Äôs injury could lead to this
Looks like big baby
We give a ton of money to Palestinians and Israel. We should stop with both.
Israelis don't care
Palestinians were celebrating in the streets when Hamas kidnapped,  raped and killed people 2 weeks ago. All three sides suck in this.
Lol, wtf is this?
I Read the wrong headline Probably. Thought you meant that the post was from somewhere else then  Al-Quds, my bad.
Hemostat.
He‚Äôs considered the Egyptian Jon Stewart.
So? Israel did both.
im saying that compared to gaza man not stand alone switzerland! The economic difference between the two places is staggering
Hamas wasn‚Äôt even a whisper when Israel started forcing Palestinians out their homes and into the strips. This started decades ago. Not 2 weeks ago with the hamas attack
Wow j6 part 2
Why are they still wearing masks?
Qatar should be attacked because hamas has dudes there??? I would fully support the idea of shooting these hamas folks right in the nose, but this obsession with wanton destruction is really too fuckin much
No, that's a bullpup assault rifle designed and manufactured in France by MAS in 1978.
Lol at MGT calling this an "insurrection"
A capital office building‚Äînot the Capitol building itself.
It sounds like Qatar should be getting attacked. Do the Gazans support Hamas?
People who disagree with Israel are not anti-semites.Jews are not a monolith. Jews are not Israel.If anything we downvote you because you're ignorant and hateful.
The residents? No. Just some hamas terrorists. Hamas, who has leadership in like ... Qatar currently.
I don‚Äôt see them chasing a officer Goodwin part 2 so probably no
Did residents of Gaza do something that hurt Israel? It's hard to believe this just happened.
when maga did this a police officer killed a veteran in cold blood
GUYS IS THIS AN INSURECTION! SHOULD WE THROW THESE PEOPLE IN FEDERAL PRISON JUST LIKE J6!
Yeah, they are besieging the place.https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/oct/17/crisis-gaza-why-food-water-power-running-out
How many people were injured?  A brazillian.
Let me assure you, I'm more stupider than you.
Everyone on here loving hamas and hezbollah were probably huge "allies" of the LGBTQ community two weeks ago, but now they are supporting an ideology that kills anyone thought to be gay. Good grief.
Did they say why?
Yeah so were the people who were slaughtered on October 7th. And it‚Äôs already been proven that this wasn‚Äôt true. IDF were not attacking civilians on the roads. Hamas is literally not letting people leave even though Israel has been telling them non stop to get out. It also came out that the attack on the hospital yesterday was caused by Hamas not Israel but everyone automatically blamed Israel. Maybe do some actually research and know what you‚Äôre talking about before coming and calling people a dumbass for no reason, cause if you look at any of my comments on this sub Reddit you would see that I condemn the killing of civilians on both sides and both Hamas and Israel are doing horrible fucking things. So stfu pleb and read a book or some shit cause you‚Äôre the dumbass here.
So much for the whole "pride" movement lol. Everyone supporting hamas and hezbollah sure do love how the religion of peace deals with anyone found gay.

Thought he was in Jurassic park
no harvey
I was just trying to clarify that this is not footage of the Al-Alhi hospital incident because many people in the comments were conflating the two incident leading to absurd conclusions. This is a separate incident in the vacinity of Al Quds hospital as you've indicated. I just had no context for your previous comment.
They are innocent civilians dumbass
I like how you asked a question about something I never said and then answered it for me lmao. 10/10 mental gymnastics. You‚Äôre clearly not arguing in good faith. Waste of time trying to reason with that.
is that video of a different airstrike then the one 6 hours ago that was repported next to **Al-Quds Hospital** ?  All occurence of this video that I could find match the time stamp of the strike of the residential tower near **Al-Quds Hospital** with a 1 hour margin.    [Footage of an attack on a residential tower near Al-Quds Hospital in Tel Elhua in Gaza City - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bi7se5GaPO0&amp;ab_channel=WarNews)   Am I not understanding what you are saying ?
That is in-line in what I hear most people, at least more conservative folks, which I mostly am as well. My problem with this, is that it ignores the errors of Israel that if not dealt with properly, will only lead to more violent conflict. Israel must stop settling the occupied lands.Edit: I don‚Äôt see any peace being remotely possible as long as Israeli settlers are in Palestinian lands.
This has got to be the neighborhood bar.
I think the children that Israel constantly murders en masse do.
Has the US demanded a ceasefire?
Most of the information come from the extensive OSINT/volunteer communities that analyse publicly available/intelligence data. From monitoring Live Web Cameras, geolocating the place of the misfired rocket blast, analyzing  Satellite imagery, photos, videos taken at the spot. Wouldn't be surprised if in the following there was a clearer picture taken from a camera at the very blast spot...  These communities have access to a great amount of data to be able to reach reliable and independent conclusions.
We aren‚Äôt involved ‚Ä¶.yet
The redditor said to Martin Luther King Jr.
Are you suggesting humanitarian aid = military funding and its influence? And while we‚Äôre at it, theres a multi billion dollar weapons industry that makes huge profits from that same tax dollar funded military funding from said weapons being bought. The same can‚Äôt be said for that humanitarian aid.
I've been to the capitol so let me tell you the differenceThese people likely sat in line for an hour or two, were metal detectored and searched, checked for a ticket/permission, then let in lawfully where they exercised a nonviolent protest, and were arrested as they planned to make a statement (that's part of the activist playbook)The January 6th protesters tore down 2-3 layers of defensive metal barriers, assaulted multiple officers, and broke windows. And that's just before they entered the building with some chanting "hang mike pence" and continuing to assault law enforcement. Most went home after and many played victim when arrestedThat a clear enough difference for ya?
Sure. But if we take all the money away they are going to keep killing each other. The only reason we give them money is so they will spend it buying American made defense equipment.  All the money comes back to the US.  It‚Äôs not for their people.
Doubt we'll ever know, tallying and publishing the deaths per building isn't likely to happen. Hopefully the residents evacuated.
This is not new. Doctors and nurses refused to abandoned patients at care homes and hospitals during disasters around the world. Good for these people.
MTG has no shame to begin with, she ain't gonna start now
Check out this ballistics expert. Being able to discern the difference between a projectile falling at terminal velocity and a JDAM missile. /s

Europe would be absolutely fine if you didn't instigate conflicts everywhere. you create enemies for europe and everyone else. You count American imperialism as a good thing. What the f am i reading these days
Huh?
Reminds me of the capital being stormed in Madison WI 10ish years ago. Chaotic yet peaceful.
It Say "NEAR" and there is one in the Vicinity (a 1hour difference can occure due to the way the time is rounded up).

Better than decapitated and burned babies you sand-sucking worms!
I mean if the US is giving money to one side they have control over some stuff.
All this bickering over Israel maybe not being involved with another hospital almost had me forget that they removed access to power, water, and food to 2 million people
And it‚Äôs in the wrong country.  The US can‚Äôt control either side.
I assume following Jan 6 outcomes; this bloke is going to spend the next 20 years in prison.

I've seen this movie many times.  The person on the balcony is never the good guy.
Do people in Switzerland routinely have their homes stolen by people that call themselves settlers? That happens in The West Bank all the time.
Gee, it's almost as if man were meant to leave these animals the f*** alone?
They've always done that. That is why policemen and women are desensitized to it. You see, when an individual *actually* can't breathe, they also can't talk, and therefore can not say "I can't breathe" 50 times.At least, that *used* to be how it worked, before asphysiated individuals could recite Shakespeare while doing jumping jacks and resisting arrest.
So, what about lgbtq people? Because anyone gay in Gaza flees to Israel for safety because if discovered they will be killed or at minimum jailed. What happened to all of the "pride" the left celebrated just a couple weeks ago? I've never understood how people call American conservatives who at least tolerate the LGBTQ community "bigots" and nazis yet sure seem to love hamas and hezbollah.

Geopolitics doesnt matter. A broad historical view doesnt matter.

Oh and America bad.There ya go, saved you time reading all of reddit  and twitters understanding of this horrible violence.
His comment is so very September 10th.
I think that‚Äôs a humas lol
Let's hear your timeline
I don't see anyone smearing shit on the walls or attacking cops here. I just see a dude being quite a bit overreactive while police are pretty gentle with him. You're allowed to protest at the Capitol. You can't storm through it violently though. Big fucking difference. These people went through security and anything they did after is on them, but they still went through security as any protestor in the Capitol needs to do.But this is America in 2023, and apparently any protestor needs to be conflated with an insurrectionist or rioter. I guess Conservatives need to do that in order to forget that Jan 6th was about interfering with the Democratic process in a final way.
Same with Ukraine
Insurrection! How did they get inside? Where is capital police? Why did they let them in? This is worse than Pearl Harbor!!!
It's delicious.It's a schmear made from chickpeas, garlic, tahini (sesame seed paste) ,lemon juice and olive oil.
Useful idiots... Doing the bidding of Hamas.
Hey, you planning on retracting this now that the obvious falsehood of it has been proven?
Fuck this is insaneIsrael is committing genocide
Lets be honest though they knew what they were doing with the title and a lot of people are stupid like me.
The issue is that it's the same sound as the rocket shrapnel made last night before it hit the hospital.TIL Hamas rocket shrapnel falling from the sky sounds like bombs Israel uses when they fall from the sky.Fuck physics üòÇ
Making a scene for those watching.
https://youtube.com/shorts/-fCr_T5_WjA?si=sV-jdY1aJq9QHiN- with the information given by other sources it's looking reliable
That‚Äôs what most posts here (this sub) are currently. Either side posting videos with at *best*, heavily biased wording. Usually it‚Äôs just straight up misinformation though. Followed by the usual commenters posting the same vitriol.
This is definitely not a public freakout. We can be sure there was a public freakout somewhere after this, but this video does not contain it.
Dude is clearly making the face that he hopes someone takes a picture of. But he just holds it so unnaturally.

Yeah I never thought I would praise Biden and let‚Äôs be real it may have been other American officials but they did a good job of at least making it look like it was him üòÖ but either way I‚Äôll give credit to the administration where it‚Äôs due. I Don‚Äôt want you to take this the wrong way I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs actually a bad idea. I just don‚Äôt see anyone agreeing to it. It‚Äôs far to reasonable. And the best I‚Äôve been able to come up with is Gaza needs to rise up and throw off Hamas then help Israel to get them at least out of Palestine and Israel. Then open trade and borders policy can maybe be established ending the apartheid they have put the Palestinians under in the name of national security from Hamas. But yeah that kinda sounds like rainbows and fairy‚Äôs. #highthoughtswiththirdeye lol
These people didn‚Äôt storm the building with the express intention to halt the electoral process.
Hamas use hospitals for military operations specifically to prey on this. They will make hospitals and elementary schools into military bases so that other countries will blame Israel for violating Geneva conventions. Clearly it works
Show the child a video of the mom being shot in front of her child, then the child slapped and pushed in a corner of dead kids. See what he says then.What a  disgusting mess we have become. This whole thing is full of evil and inhumane tragedy.  There is no excuse for the deliberate torture of anyone, and noone that can do such a sick deed is worth air.
Is this insurrection?
Have they? It doesn't look like Israel is terribly interested in hunting down Hamas. They seem to be targeting the usual suspects: innocent women and children.
Absolutley. No it dosnt make that kids suffering ok but Israel was the initial one attacked
I am empathetic to all human suffering, especially children. Today I hVe watched countless video surveillance, and forced myself to watch it. Nothing in this world is more important than finding these fucka , and bringing them death. I am so sorry Isreal, so sorry beautiful people. This is beyond anything most evil I have seen. Those pieces of shit should meet a death Roman style.....Crucifixion, make history count!I say dip your bullets in pork blood, no martyrs here

I beleive there were some arrests for vandalism and trespassing, but largely, yes.
Don't know why you're being downvoted, it does.
What a loser
Freedom of assembly bold move
What about the kids in Israel? The media and people are trying their best to turn this on Israel. Get ready, the Bible talks about the world turning their back on Israel.
Which is what Hamas chooses to do because the optics of bombing a hospital are horrible
I like his face and his delivery. I wanna see some of his work.
 pretending the US has no influence over Israel is so empty headed
pretty much, not to mention west bank where hamas doesnt even operate in - did the palestianians in west bank get their own state because they behaved? Not really.
We cant
what about the west bank? There is no hamas there. it is not that simple
I think you're probably right it sounds more reasonable but I like the gargemel one above so thats my truth now
People are so stupid. They have very little grasp of what is really going on and hadn‚Äôt had anything to protest recently, so they had to pick up the newest mantle they could.
Do u have the link?
Yep, and our western media propagated the lie
Ah my mistake. I‚Äôm talking about the Baptist bombing.
Israel claims a failed rocket hit the Al-Ahli hospital yesterday. This video is claimed to be from the Al-Quds hospital. It‚Äôs a different hospital. Nobody is claiming this one is a failed rocket.
i‚Äôm oneüëãüèΩ
Why wouldn‚Äôt the people bankrolling the conflict have a say in whether it should continue?
Yeah for real. He reminds me of a very melodramatic soccer player when they go down and try to act like they‚Äôre really hurt
A solution would undermine the US presence in the region. Politically and strategically. If there's no problem, we'd have no reason to be there.
Check the news that‚Äôs what Israel claimed and have saturated the internet with.
I think you‚Äôre right
One time an attack was blamed on Turkey in kurdistan of Iraq (north of iraq), they attacked a restaurant called ‚Äúistanbul‚Äù in Baghdad in (middle of iraq) owned by an Iraqi.
Political and strategic foothold into the middle east. If there was no Israel, it would be someone else. Plus there are connections to the Jewish people in our Nation's history. As in the war of Independence. When the US was broke and on the edge of surrender, the Jewish settlers gathered their wealth together and paid for the revolutionary army to continue the fight. But, that's not taught in the schools like it used to be.
It‚Äôs a completely different hospital than the one from yesterday. As far as I know nobody is claiming that this is a failed rocket. It looks like an Israeli strike on a building close to another hospital.
‚ÄúThe ceasefire benefits Hamas more than it does Israel.‚ÄùFunnily enough, the ceasefire actually benefits Palestinians more than it does Hamas since, if y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt know, thousands of Palestinian civilians have been killed by Israeli artillery since the music fest massacre.
Maybe stop the hate
Ah, those Hamas supersonic missiles do be failing quite often I guess.
Incredibly. My heart breaks for these families. How this happened in 2023, I just can‚Äôt even believe it.
Arms deals of 15 bln USD between the governments of Israel and Turkey, is some kind of support i guess. How many turkish weapons are used in Gaza right now?
Yes it's a shame to see the mental statue the young man is in but in all honesty at least he's alive what about all the babies that were burned how about the 20 children that were tied together and burned alive? How about the fact for the last 5 Years Hamas and the Palestinians on Gaza have been sending missiles over to Israel every single day and they have to counter react the missiles with the iron dome? Israel doesn't attack Gaza every single day the way Gaza and the enabled terrorists attack israel. Why aren't there any posts about the people that are currently being held in hostage situations? Israel isn't taking hostages so there will be a loss of life This Is War unfortunately many will be lost on both sides. But the young man in the video he needs to be told he's alive and he is blessed that he is alive
I mean it‚Äôs a hell of a coincidence that the ‚Äúfailed rocket‚Äù landed on a hospital. What are the odds?
Right!
I know this. This isn't the first time such a deal was proposed. The people over there don't care what you or I think about their fight. Age doesn't make me right but it certainly has made me wiser. Wise enough to know that this won't end until one of the two sides is eradicated.
Ty for info. Deleted cus I misinterpreted the title and only saw one vid previously of the hospital strike.
Agreed. I was quite happy with what Biden was able to accomplish. I‚Äôm not typically a fan of him but I‚Äôll give him praise when it‚Äôs due and it‚Äôs definitely due. What are your thoughts on my proposed solution?
This is a different hospital than the one that was hit yesterday.
Did she arrest the 500 protesters on her own?
so is this supposed to be another failed rocket?
Lmfao
Specially when they fire rockets on their own hospital.
Studded, you say?
Ok, that's a fair point. Israel is not without their own sins. But too many people refuse to look at the evidence at this missle strike. War sucks. The only ones who suffer are civilians.
So they openly refuse to leave an area, then scream they are monsters for hitting the area they told you to leave? This conflict is starting to make more sense
Typically, the glove gets cummed on.
Its not like Switzerland, its more like apartheid South Africa.
idiots
Holy shit you dense m***** f*****
I didn‚Äôt mean in all of history I mean one of the worst years of this GENERATION
For years the Palestinians have said sweep the jews to the sea. Its no different, also multiple country's have let the Palestinians in to them before and every single time they try to create their own state and start a civil war.. Palestinians are of no "biblical" descendants either they have no rightful land. They were given Gaza and Israel has supplied their electricity and water for years. Isreal also pulled out of Gaza in 2005 and then in 2007 Hamas stepped into power. No matter how you look at it isreals border was attacked civilians were slaughtered that is straight terrorism at its finest. Bomb Gaza to the ground on that note. Why do you think Egypt and all of the other bordering country's decline to help the Palestinians, because for decades the Palestinians have caused war within any society they are accepted to and nobody needs their shit.
About time. The conflict will get alot better now and everyone will live in peace.
I share your view of Israel right now. Hopefully the US getting involved and talking with Israeli official we can hopefully chill them out a little bit. Like the whole mid-evil siege cutting off the people from necessities for life like food and water. At least the US was able to step in and convince them to let humanitarian aid get to the people of Gaza not humas. That‚Äôs going to be harder said them done. The humanitarian aid is going to need military escort the entire time in Gaza. And somehow I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs going to be a good look if it‚Äôs Israeli soldiers
I noticed the sound was similar as well
this is not the capitol rotunda, it‚Äôs in a house office building
These are brainwashed lads being used by religious communities. They're using them to make Turkey more kind of an Eastern block country, which will be great for Putin. Arabic countries surrounding Israel, but you have not seen that kind of event in those Arabic countries. So, get the level of Islamist brainwashing in Turkey.
You still think the IDF blew up that parking lot? How "yesterday" of you.
Sorry, I misread.
Now, this was good. Well played sir well played.
Also no guys with zipties looking to kidnap members of congressNo one pissing on Nancy Pelosi's deskNo chants to hang the vice presidentNo police officers being beaten, maimed or killedNo windows being brokenNo white nationalist militiaShould I keep going? C'mon /u/FreneticFlan, if you're going to make false equivalences at least try to make ones that aren't so ridiculous.
No, my question was to the commenter above me, asking them why they thought the US wasn't involved.
Yes isreal did it for sure . As expected from them actually
I'm not commenting on the veracity of the reporting on the hospital strike yesterday, just that striking hospitals is something the IDF does.
They‚Äôve insisted over a hundred times terrorists are hiding in tunnels under hospitals and that hospital is within the area they said had to evacuate.
I'm hearing *ENCHANT√â ENCHANT√â ENCHANT√â*
Well maybe if the US stop using its VETO on every single U N resolutions for the past 60 years and providing billions of dollars every year to Israel... Pretty sure you could have done better.
Where did I say i agree with the conflict or Israel's war crimes? I just stated why the the US and NATO funnels money into the country. Wasn't that your question?
Anyone else hearing Jar Jar Binks?
The intercepted phone call, the video, the aftermath, IDF tracks rocket launches in Gaza so they have it tracked there, the fact that Hamas said Israel did it, lots of evidence that you will ignore
They should demand the PIJ stop misfiring rockets.
You're a joke , please go learn history
I saw her post as she was listening to you
&gt; The funny thing is its a perfect example/model for what could be.I'm not sure why you would consider it a "model".They are still killing kids in the West Bank.
The results of two political factions never wanting common group. Their are only losers no winners.
Yes.The West Bank areas under Palestinian control are an exclusive part of the Palestinian Authority. The Gaza Strip is under Hamas control.
Liar
Not true
And all the civilians dying in the war right now would totally agree that their lives are worth it for the greater good. The greater good of more US and EU meddling in the middle east.
You're telling me Hamas has no influence over the West Bank, yet Palestinians are still being killed in the hundreds?
Dumb take. Neither party wants a 2 state solution. Hamas wants to destroy Israel and create a new nation they controll called Palastine. Not to share the land.
This is nothing compared to gaza genocide
![gif](giphy|vX9WcCiWwUF7G|downsized)Give her the Cersei treatment
Hamas has no influence over this conflict. They are simply a prison gang that Israel has allowed and encouraged, directly (funding) and indirectly. The only countries that can end this violence is Israel and the US. If the US pulled out support for ISrael, Israel would be forced to end its illegal and brutal occupation, ethnic cleansing and concentration camp.Hamas only exists because of the Israeli occupation.
First, this is a different event. Secondly, the source for the casualties was Hamas. I've not seen any independent confirmation of casualties.
Its not confusing if you can read.
Still idf are more evil and more terrorists than hamas
Isreal is a vital strategic port for deploying troops to the area as it I the Eastern Coast of the Mediterranean.  Having it be lost to potential enemies would cut off their access to the middle east for European allies.
I don‚Äôt know how or if it is being used for hostile means. Israel probably has some intelligence that it is being used in such a way, the credibility of which I can‚Äôt comment on. The point is that the protections given to hospitals are given to them according to their  current function, not due to the nature of their infrastructure.
I have never heard of Hamas before recent events
What evidence do you have to support this claim?
Idf should be punished for their evil acts
There is certainly something to be said about the US's unwavering and seemingly unconditional support of Israel with regards towards its policies in the Occupied West Bank. Additionally the US can and has been important in getting Israel to ease up on their siege in Gaza. As for its actual war in Gaza, I'm not sure the US can or needs to act, except as a watchdog.
This seems consistent with the verified NYT video but shows that the building was already on fire. Is it possible the whistling is the fuel igniting and not the rocket?
the US government funds the Israeli military. they are calling on the US government to negotiate a ceasefire.
says the guy on reddit lol
Reminds me of Jurassic park
Talk to me when he gets put in prison for the next decade.
I think a lot of people don't realize this wasn't a shock to hamas.  They didn't plan to win a war with Israel.  They needed to radicalize more kids.  this entire thing had been a recruiting drive for hamas.
Are these people disrupting the counting of the electoral college votes in an attempt to prevent the peaceful transfer of power?
There was a 2 state solution offered, but Hamas rejected it in favour of their religious war.   Age doesn‚Äôt make you right man.
I dont think this action will help "ending violence" it looks more like "spreading anger" I hate war but this way of acting doesnt really look like it helps It only serves as "false comfort".
I think no matter who you are what Color you are what religion you believe in . It doesn‚Äôt matter everyone knows this is heart breaking and the rest of the world should be called on to do something . My heart hurts for the people of Israel and Ukrainian as well .
Ah, you‚Äôre fucked bud. Sorry.
No burgers for you!
That‚Äôll show em!!
The funny thing is its a perfect example/model for what could be. The West Bank is like Switzerland compared to Gaza.
Because they are brainwashed by western media and hate towards muslims , forgetting the fact that  isreal is an occupier, we've been seeing the news for years so we know killing innocents in gaza is not a new thing actually, so basically isreal started it , as it started wars with arabs in 1967 taking over Egyptian sinai and syrian golan heights, but when palastinans fight for their freedom they are terrorists , that's obvious hypocrisy .
&gt;What benefit is it for Israel to bomb a hospital?Idk why don‚Äôt you ask them? They‚Äôve bombed dozens of schools and hospitals over the years.
Well, Israel is not without it's own sins, but this rocket does appear to have been fired within Gaza, and there is a lot of evidence to back that up. Including a live feed at the time by Al-Jazerra.
https://preview.redd.it/c1wfji6bc1vb1.jpeg?width=720&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e492137fce2a72a7859c7caf36d201d8aafcdfdbPress conference among the dead.
I think the sound and the blast sounding exactly the same, and the fact that it's right near a hospital make it confusing. Israel I believe is taunting the Palestinians.
By "minister" you mean that influencer?
Hopefully they continue finding out too!
Hamas did bomb there own hospital(Hamas uses homemade rockets which r very prone to failure) Hamas is actually killing there own kind raping and torturing. The land was not owned by Palestine it was shared among them which was given by the British. Hamas is hiding among civilians using them as meat shields while trying to paint Israel as the bad guys. Buddy ur in the wrong side of history

It's probably to scare the shit out of the people inside.
You would have to ask the IDF since they previously told hospitals to evacuate and have [hit some already](https://www.archbishopofcanterbury.org/news/news-and-statements/gaza-hospitals-are-facing-catastrophe-says-archbishop-canterbury)
Have you seen Al-Jazerra's live feed? They were filming at the same time the hospital was struck. And it shows rockets fired from inside Gaza, and one failing, hitting the hospital. It actually didn't hit the hospital, it hit the parking lot. Do you think Al-Jazerra doctored the footage? Or is lying for Israel?
read "Imperialism: The Highest Stage of Capitalism" by Lenin
Why do you think we're not involved in the conflict? The US provides Israel with $3.8 billion in military aid every year.
We are currently sending aid to Palestinians in Gaza. Hamas always takes it away from their own people. So hopefully they won't do it again. What else would you suggest doing?
This is not the hospital that was bombed. This is a residential building near a completely different hospital. Stop spreading misinformation.
True, Hamas is far less tolerant (although there are certain Jews who are nearly as fascist.) Aside from cultural differences though, it is the threat of violence that's the bigger problem. If Hamas was as well armed as Israel there would be zero Jews, perhaps anywhere.
Israel minister tweet then later deleted the tweet that their rocket hit the hospital building that caused so much casualties
This is a video of a building beside an entirely different hospital than the one currently in the headlines
This is not the hospital that got bombed. This is a residential building near a completely different hospital. Don't spread misinformation.
This is so frustrating. PLEASE PEOPLE, stop blindly believing what hamas says. They lie and will use Palestinians as sacrifices for their goal. That‚Äôs always been part of their strategy (remember suicide bus bombs?). How can you believe people like that?
Thank you for your feedback. Yes it probably had some influence playing all of those retro games into doing this graphics. Sound is also improved, in the original intercept you can't listen to the second Hamas terrorist that well.  My understanding of this war is no-one has reason, it's senseless to kill civilians, use them as human shields and to hold them hostage in their own land. These terror groups need to exist no more and be replaced with peace and dialog between people who wish to prosper in this land. My condolences go out to all the families of those who lost loved ones in this senseless conflict.
Where is the real Crazy stuff cant find something really bloody
Fucking.... Thanks!
How is it a win for conservatives? This guy got treated as if he was breaking the law just like the Jan 6 folks did. And I don‚Äôt see anybody in the comments giving a shit if he gets jail time. If anything it just reinforces the fact that everyone will be treated the same regardless of political affiliation, which sounds more like an L for the conservative propaganda machine. They‚Äôre not the victims they think they are.
They do know that US politicians don‚Äôt have the power to do that, right?
I saw that pothole in the parking lot. I got a lot of shit for saying, how can they already know the number of deaths and who is putting out these numbers, which kept changing. So then I just waited. As of now, apparently that large number was utter bs. and I saw that missile malfunction in mid air on multiple feeds.  Yes governments lie but this one is not on Israel.
With the gold thing today, I fully expect an explosion of bots.
This is a different hospital from the one that was hit yesterday. The hospital from yesterday is the Al-ahli hospital. The title of this video says it's from the Al-Quds hospital.
No idea how old you are. I've seen this shit since I was a child. I'm 60. They're both wrong, they're not going to stop until no one's left to fight, and no amount of talk or negotiation is going to stop their conflict. Forget the political BS. This is steeped in religious fever and always has been at the very core of it all. Personally, IDGAF if they do wipe each other out. And don't think for a second that Israel doesn't target civilians. That's a naive thought.
Yeah we can't change anything. Accept it and just move on. Never going to reach peace. It's a pipe dream.
This is a residential tower strike from the POV of a different hospital.  An entirely different event from the Al-ahli hospital everyone was talking about yesterday,
The Hamasburglar
Well the good news is there is a chance they will be stopped, there is aid incoming (if Hamas doesn't take it away from the people they claim to love) and fwiw, Putin has investments in this war as well. I hope people realize that Russia has been attacking in various methods since at least 2014. There's a reason he met with Bibi and also with Hamas funders.
Also how do 500 people even fit on that parking lot near the hospital .. no missile crater . I call bullshit on the numbers and who this guy says is at fault
McDonalds is a symbol of American imperialism... At least, most Americans felt that way when it opened in USSR...
Do you think the constitution gives you the right to protest in any government building you want?
Oh no, there goes Tokyo‚Ä¶
I saw a guy walking away at the end with a machete. Dude brought a machete to a plastic chair fight. He must have been so embarrassed.
The big difference is all these people lined up and went through security, instead of following people who were beating up cops and damaging property. They also chose the Cannon building specifically because they wouldn‚Äôt be interrupting congress. This was a planned arrest.
&gt; indicating they are not targeting civiliansWell, that's a **lie**.
Jews are hypocritical. Becoming what they once hated.
Ha, that was my first thought
Screw the Constitution, amirite?
I've never understood the point of making yourself hard to arrest...well, more accurately,I've never understood why you do that and then complain about a resulting boo boo.  That said, I don't think he was hurt but was scared (which I also don't get).
Are everyone here in the comments going to keep pretending the title doesn't clearly state this isn't the hospital that was talked about last night? This is an airstrike of a tower near al-quds hospital not the Al-ahli hospital everyone was talking about yesterday lol
Instead of saying you have proof just provide the proof.
What does that help? I‚Äôm lost
Israel isn‚Äôt targeting civilians, they tell people to leave, give safe corridors for people to move, and do ‚Äúknocks‚Äù and calls before targeting a building. Hamas targets civilians, uses its own as human shields, tells them not to listen to the IDF when they tell people to leave, and parades the bodies of raped and murdered women through their streets. Keep the facts straight bud
HAMAS fucked around and found out
Uhmmmm, cleansing, just like they've done in the past.
Because those zealots will always be fighting but it‚Äôs US fault that instead of fighting with sticks and rocks Israel has weapons of mass destruction.
Oh look! Insurrection part 2. I wonder if we will see the same level of outrage in the media.
He is officially traumatized
Maybe he has a bad shoulder, if so.eone bent my shoulder that way I'd be screaming for sure.
Can anybody explain the cut / skip in the video?
What benefit is it for Israel to bomb a hospital?
I wonder if it just hit something like an oxygen tank
That's all fine and good. There's one problem. We aren't involved in the conflict. It's Israel and Hamas. Unfortunately civilians on both sides are being targeted. We can't  make them stop. Best we can do is try to get them to stop. And somehow, at the moment, I don't think either side is going to listen to us.
Quit spreading Hamas misinformation
Of course, but I‚Äôm not sure why you are bringing this up.
Marge is already trying to call this an ‚Äúinsurrection‚Äù lol.
Fricking sad and gross
Israel held its own last time that happened. They're even more capable now. People fight harder when their existence is on the line.
Also appears to not be coming from a Hamas rocket exploding from a failed launch like Israel is claiming.
Meh, dunno why i was expecting some sophisticated capoeira or smth
What is a demonstrator vs a protestor?
He should play Soccer.
Again-its a random twitter account. It isn‚Äôt a valid source of information no matter what they wrote.
So you‚Äôre just getting preemptively mad about something in your imagination?   Must be a rough life.
I mean their rockets are made from water pipes, they took from their own people .... Also Israels strikes seem to flatten whole blocks.... The after photo of this isn t very impressive
Insurrection!
Why are  they smiling
This is deluded. No chance in hell would Hamas ever negotiate with the US and I doubt Israel even without American support would even want to consider negotiating with Hamas
Israel is a valuable ally in the region and a hub of technology. It‚Äôs worth every cent we send them. We can absolutely condition funds on them leaving people alone, though.
Quran, if you will.
Nah you can‚Äôt be this dumb üòÇNotoriously anti-Israel outlet Al-Jazeera broadcast the rocket misfiring and hitting the hospital live. Guess that was propaganda too lmao
Brain dead - motivated purely by hate‚Ä¶. Live a life full of built up anger over religious beliefs ‚Ä¶ what a waste of human life.
You actually believe the Israeli propaganda? Lmao the IDF literally took credit for bombing the hospital before backtracking and blaming hamas
Has the same energy as ‚Äúoh you use an iphone how can you say capitalism is bad?‚Äù
I doubt we see similar prison sentences given to these folks as were given to non-violent Jan 6 offenders
*Hamas bombing
Fair warning your joking right ? to a hospital full of staff staying open to treat patients who need them . How is it being used for hostile means ? Can you tell me where these people go if they do choose to evacuate ?
Wow! That really showed those Israelis!!
That's not realistic.  Any US politican who cut Israel off would lose lots of political support.  Also the US does benefit to some extent from Israel's intelligence.  Although the conspiracy theorists also believe that Israel has blackmail material on tons of US politicians (eg Epstein style).
What are they saying? For some reason all I'm hearing is Gargamel.
People take advantage of the changes in police presence during protests. That doesn't necessarily mean the two events are co-sponsored.
Just like January 6th these idiots need to be put on a no fly list and sent to prison
Imagine having enough free time to throw away protesting
Example please? Not refuting it just want to see for myself
Nothing quite like escaping from poor, chaotic countries to wealthier, civilized countries only to stir up chaos and disrupt peace because things are going badly in your home country.
Actually, the plague was way worse, and so was the Spanish flu. WW1 in terms of life's lost in obsurdly horrific ways was also arguably worse so with in recent history I would say that 1918 was probably the "worst year" globally because combo of ww1 and Spanish flu. Or maybe even 1944-45 because of ww2 and the holocaust Keep your head up, I hope you and your family are safe. Things may seem awful, but take some solice in the fact that things are getting better all the time and life has always been awful, and people have always found ways to find happiness and hope for a better world.
I so paleIsabelleI can't tell
&gt;a 2-state solution.The thing the US has brokered multiple times? And has been rejected by the Palestinians (specifically) multiple times?
This is the high point of my day ... so farTHANK YOU
Who wrote this headline?  Propaganda, just like the missile came from dumbass Hamas.  All supporters of Hamas need to be on a list.
I don't understand why anyone would protest at the Capitol, no one's working there.
While it is horrible that this building was destroyed due to hatred of Israel, I think it should be pointed out that this building was partially destroyed and ransacked after the Tunisian Revolution in 2011. Since the revolution, Jewish communities all over Tunisia have relocated to Israel due to economic hardship and the increased presence of Islamic extremist groups. They automatically become full cirizens if they go to Israel, so it is an easy decision. They have also been digging up and bringing their deceased ancestors with them to Israel. There isn't currently a Jewish community where this synagogue is, it is just an abandoned building in a mostly abandoned area. That is why there is no emergency response, nothing is there, and no one uses this synagogue.
If these people could read they would be very upset.
Hamas are openly stated terrorists what they have done to Israel is nothing more than terror and genocide
Right? The conservatives are going to have a fuckin field day. These dipshit protesters changed absolutely nothing, and gave conservative Americans a major propaganda win. Capitol police should've dealt with this extremely quickly, and with force.
I don‚Äôt know why but your comment got me to start busting up laughing üòÇ
Second chair fight in the last 20minutes. Triggered a new algorithm‚Ä¶
These clowns don‚Äôt understand geopolitics or what is actually going on ‚Ä¶ as usual they probably get their news after 10 seconds of scrolling socials. 1-Rockets are continuing to be fired non stop from Gaza towards Israel.2-Over 150 hostages still being held captive by Hamas.3-Surrounding Arab nations are doing nothing to push for a ceasefire or peace from Hamas, instead they are blindly just criticizing Israel. Qatar for one, hosts the Hamas leaders so they can do something if they wanted to.So‚Ä¶. These guys calling for ceasefire‚Ä¶. They realistically think that if Israel stops going after Hamas that everyone will be happy and start picking flowers ?
I myself as a woman would never go into a crowd like that.
The best part of this is that Israel can just record a phony conversation in Arabic and the western world will lap it up like drooling morons. "durr hey that was our rocket right bro?"
10/18 is worse than 9-11
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has been tracking deaths in the conflict since 2008 and¬†its data shows¬†that 5,600 Palestinians died up to 2020 while 115,000 were injured. 250 Israelis died during the same period while 5,600 were injured.¬†   No , I do not believe the violence is equal.
If you haven't seen anything before October 7, I urge you to look at some of it. Things like Israelis using Palestinians knee caps for target practice, using illegal weapons like napalm bombs, stealing more and more land....etc. While the Oct 7 attack was horrible, it's far from surprising.
It looks like they are checking his oil.
That‚Äôs why we back Israel the country that is actively committing genocide? The apartheid state? The colonist nation that is violently removing the indigenous population from the land? Those are the universal human rights you are talking about? Also you realize Palestinian people have lived there for centuries with Jews, Muslims, and Christians right?
Yeah, Hamas wasn‚Äôt founded from the hate nourished by some Palestinians against the Israel opression
Green hat flew over that table
What does this have to do with him "demonstrating" for a cease fire tho
No, it was a Hamas rocket that disintegrated mid air. Debris landed near by and caused a fire. But people dont like to let things like evidence stand in the way of the narrative. It as if some people think Hamas are good people and not child murdering terrorists, who are just the same as the IDF.Edit: Just to clarify, I am NOT condoning what the Israeli state has done or is doing, they are terrorists just as Hamas are. Targeting civilians is beyond disgusting. But, in order to understand what is going on, on both sides, people need to have facts and not just believe the first thing they read. Confirmation bias is a MF and prevents people from learning and improving.
I‚Äôm confused, they‚Äôre in the wrong spot right? Israel would order a ceasefire not a separate random ass country.
Israeli embassy security guards: ‚ÄúBoss, are we getting paid overtime tonight?‚Äù
Or get this dissolving the genocidal ethno state and reforming one that is actually accepting of all people instead of immediately assaulting and arresting people for being Palestinian you know it might just solve the key issue as to why all this conflict is happening if people‚Äôs holy land isn‚Äôt claimed by someone then everyone is happy if their house isn‚Äôt stolen they are happy if they are not assaulted in the street for their ethnicity they are happy
Two states bud. Its the only way forward without complete elimination of one side or the other.
ü§ñ
I had the opposite reaction. With US politics always being in the wrong side of history I figured storming the capital would happen more often. Especially for this, Israel needs to be stopped and the US cannot afford to fund another war.
Why does the U.S. support Saudi Arabia then? I‚Äôll show you facts that prove my statement if you‚Äôd like. Universal rights. Palestinians are being denied water, food, and electricity on a regular basis. You guys are supporting genocide.
That's interesting. That *does* look like two strikes.
Why didn't they call for a ceasefire BEFORE Hamas butchered 1400 innocent people?
It's classic strategy to exaggerate how hurt you are, last desperate attempt to garner some sort of sympathy or even get a reaction from bystanders.How terrible the George Floyd murder was, now you get jokers everywhere saying they can't breathe when the cops detain them.
You can clearly hear the officers telling him to calm down while he continues to squirm and yelp for no reason
took away McRibs again
But I thought Hamas were just resistance fighters?
This whole year has been war after war after war, so many innocent people lives have been lost throughout 2023 this is by far one of the worst year ever
Too bad, Jordan canceled Bidens summit in Jordan with Abdullah, Sissi and Abbas due to the popular misinformation about the Gaza hospital strike, so any negotiations are on hold on the US front. I'm sure the people pushing that story before even a single iota of evidence was provided over on this subreddit are happy.Including you, u/CantStopPoppin , you were karma farming away happily without any regard for facts on this very topic!
Peace in Israel/Palestine would be a victory over Hamas. Hamas doesnt want peace they want Israel to create thousands in collateral damage.  Radicalizing remaining victims. Next generation jihadists.  Look at our(American) attempts at bulldozing the middle east. Taliban stronger than ever and ISIS is like free range chickens in Iraq.
It's McDonalds. Hell was already unleashed upon them.
Plus parking lot full of cars with fuel as well (rocket fell short, landed in side of building at parking, side of building which would have Oxygen and nitrogen tanks as well as back-up fueled generators.  Friendly fire happens in all wars, but do not try to smear this on Israel as they did not turn a street light into a low tech rocket.
Might be similar. I recall someone screaming while wrist being twisted.  Sorry. I have no sound so I did not hear the chant. I guess I stand corrected. Thanks.
This guy is not the sharpest knife in the kitchen.    Problem is schools suck and nobody learns history.
People don‚Äôt want to be denied universal rights‚Ä¶Correct. That‚Äôs why we back Israel. Palestine does not support human rights, doesn‚Äôt support freedom of religion, doesn‚Äôt support lgbt, doesn‚Äôt support women‚Äôs rights, etc.
Was he arrested for protesting, or was he actually arrested for something like trespassing? I've just had to explain to someone concerning the London extinction rebellion protests that people aren't being arrested for protesting, they're being arrested for things like vandalism and trespassing. It's very misleading to word it as if they were arrested for the subject of their protest unless that's actually the reason, and it just adds more mistrust towards anything claimed by the side you're trying to support, as you're clearly pushing propaganda.
Maga lady was shot
Lmao the dude looks so funny trying to pretend he's getting mauled
Do you have a source for the US supplying money to Hamas?
Fiction:  They bombed their own hospital on accident.   its called "friendly fire" Mate, and yep.... your people did this to YOUR people. This is what happens when you make rockets from street plumbing and street lights. its called "Islamic engineering" and its .... self destructive and primitive.
[Gangs of New York](https://youtu.be/bmJsHv18SEQ?si=ACbw73wV1Ld68E8a) does a very intense scene similar. Not pretty
Hmmm, What's that their chanting in the background?
Precisely my point, you say you know what happened a week and a half ago but were ignorant to the decades of occupation.
Exactly. Except the US pays Israel for their military technology so that they can add it to their own arsenal e.g. Iron Dome.
Mcdonald‚Äôs in israel is giving out free meals to IDF soldiers so people think all of mcdonald‚Äôs is bad. However as it‚Äôs a franchisee model it depends on what the owner of that individual store does, to an extent.
It is how it works fuck IDF fuck Hamas fuck the right wing of Israel they are all knob ends
All the more reason to discontinue using tax payer money to fund positions in that region.
I mean we do have a right to peaceful protest, it‚Äôs the part about violence is the problem

Straight-up antisemitism. Targeting a religion because Israel does something they don‚Äôt like. Despicable.
Jews against Jews, this is like Christian's against Christ! Come one people! Jews supporting the death of jews. What the hell is going on in the world??? lol
\[unlike the J6 insurrectionists\] They didn't beat or kill anyone to get inside.Edit: oh, no my context went missing!
We could not give them money, let them pay for their own damn war.
Can someone please explain? Why are they annoying themselves, their patients, and the public with sirens?
Maybe they want the US to not be the single country that vetoes a UN resolution to provide aid to Gaza.
My god, this is devastating
I'd bet a months wages that Netanyahu knew this was coming and let it happen anyway so they could bomb the shit out of them without geopolitical repercussionsE: You're downvotes do nothing zionists. Your "9/11" doesn't justify your ethnic cleansing.

No.  They are a terrorist group.
you mean the Islamic accidental bombing called "friendly fire" because they made home-made primitive rockets out of street lights ?   Yeah, that is what happened.   Insane these people ... Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah etc.    There are consequences to your crazy Islamic world.....
After the massive 1/6 prosecutions, I‚Äôm surprised that anyone protests at the capital‚Ä¶
There also wasn't any Israeli strike with a tenth of the supposed death count (a 20th of the more ambitious ones). Photographic evidence from the morning after shows a tiny crater with practically no damage to the buildings, so entirely within reason for a PIJ rocket.[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67144061](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67144061)
its called "friendly fire" Mate, and yep.... your people did this to YOUR people.   This is what happens when you make rockets from street plumbing and street lights.   its called "Islamic engineering" and its .... self destructive and primitive.
They're like Philadelphia Phillies fans. Doesn't anyone work?
BINGO
&gt;The apathy in your words stings like diabetic neuropathyThis seems very specific
I wonder how many Brazilian dollars worth of damage was done!
He just wants clout... so dumb... haha
I think I have seen this video and it might not be related to Israel.  Might be older.
US government literally told Israel to open back up humanitarian aid into Gaza.  Shit like this is a talking point amongst ‚Äúelite‚Äù educated.  How the fuck did they get so delusional!?Edit: I‚Äôm replying to the OP if people are confused.  The US said Israel needs to open aid back up to the Gaza Strip, Israel is complying, indicating they are not targeting civilians (unlike Hamas).  Hamas habitually uses its own people as human shields.  Cmon people this has been going on for decades..
People don‚Äôt want to be denied universal rights and to be dominated by occupiers. Get your head out of your ass.
It is something they have done. They warned them to evacuate. They issued statements about destroying a "Hamas" base in the hospital. they retracted it later because they realized they now look like shit. zionists have been exposed for what they are
Us has zero influence on any party other than Israel.

You sound very unhinged.
Dude this guy started wailing when he got his arm behind his back in front of a building containing NOBODY that can solely cause a ceasefire. His actions and efforts could have been invested anywhere else and been more helpful than giving himself a criminal record. His actions discount those of actual activists by making them look like screaming children.  This sounds incredibly delusional considering you're the person who is sharing it with the sub "public freakout", bringing negative attention to it.You're also WILD for assuming my stance based off my criticizing the way this guy handled himself.
This comment is all over the place. What exactly are you trying to say? Hamas represents the Gaza Strip where this current war is happening and therefore they need to be party to any ceasefire. This is basic common sense.
Don‚Äôt worry his girlfriend boyfriend will take care of her till he gets out of jail. This dude is a clown. How did he think acting like this would change anything. I bet next he is going to sit in the road and block regular hard working parents from getting to work. That will teach them.
Didn't know Hamas represented all of Palestine. Nor did the US capitol have any say with what Hamas wanted. Tell me, do the foreigners locked in gaza also represent Hamas? Go do your impressions of a fanatical SS elsewhere. This is exactly like the 1930s this time however it isn't the jews who are exterminated. it's the Palestinians. Netanyahu was warned of Hamas' intentions. He didn't move a finger to stop it.
with no speaker, bold move..
That's not forceful twisted, that's held behind your back.Like Im no krav maga expert but I've held arms at sharper angles during sex... I think you should look again at the video bud
Please stop spreading misinformation. It isn't confirmed that it was Israel or Hamas, but most of the current evidence is leaning towards a Hamas misfire. Israel has already done enough fucked up shit to earn peoples scrutiny (use of white phosphorus, cutting off water, etc) you don't need this to be the reason people hate them. There already are enough to hate both the IDF AND Hamas. Lying or willingly eating up misinformation only hurts the Palestinian cause.
They goal is to eliminate their oppressors who happen to be Israel the best choice would be cut funding and start to get as many civilians out so the genocidal dick heads can kill each other
Do you really think Hamas wants a cease fire?
Have your arm forcefully twisted behind your back and let's see how you act.
The US absolutely does not have influence over Hamas. Also, Hamas does not want a two state solution their founding document and stated goal is the complete elimination of Israel and the death of all Jews.
Now THIS is how you PEACEFULLY protest at a Capitol building.
Buddy's here trying so hard to look like a police brutality victim, lol the cop is actually putting a comforting hand and telling him to calm down.
I've been seeing a lot more people utilizing chairs lately.
You know that r/PublicFreakout became the laughingstock of reddit because of these kind of videos right?
Most people everywhere hate their governments
The US government doesn't want a ceasefire. They want bloodshed. Actions speak louder than words.
If I ever get in a position where a McDonald's is being destroyed..Let me get there 5 mins early so I can get a Mcdouble and some nuggets.Let me live.
You have a point regarding the US' influence, but nobody in the capital building themselves has any sort of authority or influence to cause a ceasefire. And this guy screaming wildly certainly isn't going to convey his message any clearer.
Those idiots kicking glass are just asking to cut an artery

They are Palestinians and other Arab minor societies in Istanbul.
You guys think we‚Äôre about to learn that equipping all these countries with a ton of weapons just to make some dough may have been a bad idea.
that'll show em
Without US support, Israel loses at least 4 billion in financial support annually and would almost certainly get sanctioned by the UN.US has the influence to bring both parties to the negotiating table towards peace and a 2-state solution.
Yeah that‚Äôll show them.
Rable rable table
Ahh, bars, always entertaining
the video from OP is a lie.. Palestinia never existed ... Jews could not have had a palestinian pass if palestina never existed.  israel was under the controll of the he Ottoman Empire from 1517 - around 1917. It was then ruled by the british until 1947. Where the arabs in the area and the jews got promised each their own country. Something that happent in 1948 that instantly lead to a new war with the "palestininas" and several other arab states around.  Thats a fact... so how jews could have a palestinian pass when palestinina never existed as a country is pretty strange
People forget that substantially more Palestinians were killed by Arab armies than by Israel's. They don't care about the Palestinians, never did.
So I‚Äôve looked and tried to find a simple explanation as to what is happening, but can‚Äôt find it in the thread. Are these Isreal citizens protesting the war? Or is it citizens in support of peace for Palenstine? Thanks in advance if anyone takes the time out to explain it to me. :)
Nice
People in Turkey, destroy an American franchise restaurant, over a war going on in Isreal and Palestine..... That's enough internet for me today.
Isn't feeding one army side has something to do with the conflict directly

Good question
Looks like somebody made this graphic on their Nintendo64.  I don't know whose rocket it was but I support Palestinians being considered citizens and I know the propaganda wheels are already turning on both sides.  I am going to stay grounded in my feelings about Palestine being it's own free nation since israel and their allies are going to have far more power in dictating to Americans how evil the Palestinian side is.  Now that all hell has broken loose I am going to avoid allowing myself to be swayed.  I was dead set against anymore war after Afghanistan and then in no time we are fighting a proxy war in ukraine.  I had been believing the propaganda regarding how much progress the Ukrainians were making when the reality is their progress has ground to a halt and they have no interest in peace talks.  For me, it is time to tell Zelensky he better start considering peace talks soon or they can figure it out without us.  My opinion on Israel is they need to make some kind of concession to provide Palestine with it's own territory so that there can be some type of movement towards peace between the groups that might have some chance of lasting.  Right now Palestinians are surrounded on all sides by Israelis and most Israelis couldn't care less about Palestinians and echo a sentiment that the only good Palestinian is a dead palestinian.  Israelis ought to be more thankful the world stepped in and stole palestine then named it Israel and handed it over to jewish people.
Lmao there is no life in gaza, the franchisee owners in arab states sent financial aid to gaza, in hope the boycott would leave them alone, but not the management. McDonalds in Israel was posted on social media's official channels, which means support by the management.
Because storming the Capital to usurp elections, and threatening to kill anyone who gets in their way is just doing their patriotic duty. üëç
I want everybody who believes in a God to wipe each other out, period.Religion is nothing but the act of brainwashing people until they're mentally ill.We were about 50 years away from Atheist/Agnostics out numbering the Christian/Catholics in America. Hopefully this stupid "Holy War" bumps that estimate closer by a decade or quarter century.
My fucking ass it was a misfire, multiple rockets failing at the same time? All hitting the same spot even though they all failed?
Obviously not an expert, but for the loss of life involved here isn't it unlikely it was a cheap rocket (non-Israeli)?  I've never heard of a Palestinian rocket with anything close to that big of a casualty count.
I say bomb temple mount until it's nothing but a smoldering crater in the ground. Then all these Jewish/Christian/Muslim idiots will have nothing left to fight over.The best thing about religious idiots in the modern world is that their actions are recorded and seen by everyone. Rational people can see religion for what it is in real-time, a mental illness.  We were about 50 years away from Atheist/Agnostics out numbering the Christian/Catholics in America. Hopefully this stupid "Holy War" bumps that estimate up by a decade or quarter century.

Waiting for idiots to ask why babbitt got shot and not this guy.
History tells us there is no peace, only less death on some days
I'm just not sure who they were "demanding" considering they're in the US not Israel. Not to mention acting like a fucking demon when being put on the ground. Who does this guy think he's helping?
Article 21 of the Geneva Convention permits it IF the hospital is being used for hostile means AND with fair due warning
Why the fuck randomly to the US Embassy? Do Lebanese people even know where their own continent is?
It is, but there are cases when it is acceptable. Article 21 of the Geneva Convention sets these to be if the hospital is being used to harm the enemy, it loses its protections. However, the opposing side must give due notice to evacuate before acts are taken against it.

Nice lies
Turks are muslim. Palestinians are muslim. They're pissed at Israel because they're making no effort to actually target hamas, they're killing everyone including women and children under the pretence of targetting hamas. America blindly supports Israel regardless of the international laws and human rights they  ignore. So they're mad at america too.
Oh man this is super awkward now huh
Assuming that this hospital is being used for anything other than treatment of the sick and injured, then Israel is compliant with Article 21 of the Geneva convention
Idiots

Honestly, it doesn't take much motivation for a group of young men to destroy something, regardless of location or ethnicity.
Powder keg.
Yep, I will never understand why people will just comment their suspicions to a question without actually knowing what‚Äôs going on. Mc D supports Israel and the IDF
Where were they when the Isreal babies were killed, the young lives were paraded in the back of trucks, and raped and kidnapped? No Protests for the innocents who were murdered at the festival?Hamas bombed that Hospital because this is what they want... Sorry, I'm not falling for it.... they killed their own people for propaganda.
That'll teach 'em!
I actually wouldn't put this past them
You think the violence is equal, the terrorists assaulted women, and still is holding hostages
Did you somehow overlook the mass rape and murder done by hamas?
You appear to still be ignorant of the situation
How can you hate Toyota though? Their cars and trucks are top-of-the-line beasts. Some I swear are indestructible.
They donated free meals to the IDF
Hell, most Israeli Jews hate their government.
I wonder if they will have the same energy against PIJ and Hamas once they learn that the hospital was blown up by a malfunctioned rocket launched by PIJ. There is a literal phone call of one PIJ copping to this tragedy. Plus, all of the video and aerial imaging evidence.
Ayy yes, destruction in ‚Äúprotest‚Äù over a conflict. A truthful title would be ‚Äúcriminals destroy McDonalds‚Äù
I wonder if they will have the same passion against the PIJ once these people learn that it was a misfired rocket which hit that hospital.
the issue is way more complicated then just hamas. Also No\_Touch is right about the media and driving devision.  Though a few points from me on this topic.  if you really wanna decode the issue its way more complicated going almost 4000 years back.  But before hamas Isreal oppesed palestina. But the core is palestininans say they dont deserve the country and they own it.. Something that in reality is false. Nether Palestina existed ( only the romans called the area for it and if i am not wrong there where mostly jews and christinas back then there not muslimes? could be wrong here ) and so did never israel. Both country are based on an identity that are heavily based on religion. So we need to take into account religion here.  Also on top of that before israel was a thing the tyrkish empire back then owned the whole area, Palestinians and israel people all got promised their own land in WW2 if they helped, this is the actuall birth of the todays israel and immidiatly went into a war with the palestinians that refused to have israel and jewish people there and wanted it all for them self and got support from 4-5 arabic coutnries that joined the war.  and last but not least i mentioned religion. Everything here is based on religion sadly and jewish people and muslimes in general have not a good history to say it nice. Also the jewish religion is the oldest out of the 3 main religion ( to be exact 1300 BC to 700 AC jewish people had mostly controll over jerusalem and the town is very important. Christians became a big part of that history at around 500 AC ? .. anyway .. at the birth of islam a war broke out in the middle east that wanted to make islam the main religion where both christians and jewish people had to flee. Something we could say they got thrown out of their homes.  So with these few points...  Conflict is very big of an issue .. people might say "palestinians owned israel historically" ... something i would deny both because palestina never existed and jewish people where there 2000 years before they got thrown out. Also we could argue that the todays situation in israel could be blamed on todays palestinians starting a war trying to throw them out again roughly said.    But we do not need to forget ... israel is not innocent ether here. This includes the occupation of the west bank. Taking more for israel in land area then aggreed in FN and general things we could call for religious racism and bad threadment of of the arabs in israel and gazal and west bank. Israel is not innocent ether.   In the end this is a very complicated conflict we can go almost 4000 years back in history and use that for an argument who has the right to be there and controll the area. But that is nonsesen ... war is war and borders change. In the end we should try to resolve this issue neutral way.. but i wonder if that even is possible with how complicated it is
Or an Android based phone.
&gt;What the mcdonald do?https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/free-meals-israeli-soldiers-divide-mcdonalds-franchises-over-israel-hamas-war-2023-10-17/Just putting it out there
Yea. But it came from the cemetery behind the hospital‚Ä¶

Dude, ur analogy is retarded. Not even applicable to the situation.
Also please bro go down vote that sorry sap who had the suicide bomber comment. Get those toxic ppl out of here
Sure you can, we picked a side in the US civil war, picked a side in Europeans vs American Indians, picked a side in WW2.  At this point they, Israel, needs to pick weather they want endless terrorism, the Palestinians need to pick if they want to also suffer endless war. Either integrate peacefully somehow or someone has to decisively win and set the rules as the victor. Both think they are right, neither will entertain the conversation so it comes down to someone setting it via complete unconditional surrender of the other and unfortunately the only way to do that is to make it so painful to the opposing side that they indeed  capitulate fully and never go down those old paths again. The south was razed, the great tribes were completely broken and entire German and Japanese cities were blasted and burnt to the ground. Peace followed..Those wars ended decisively!!
Bro thank you. Thank God I'm not alone. Please bro. Spread the love. Or we may all end up like this.

Did they turn around and stop when it was determined to be a ‚Äúfriendly fire‚Äù incident that was not Israel?
But HAMAS did bomb it not the israel.
In the US as well man. Isreal or Palestine, seeing a child feel like this hurts to see I can only imagine how they feel. Seems that allot of people here lose their sense of compassion pretty easily
Translation please.
Source?Also  I mean I could say the same to you about the fanboy part.
And that makes it okay??? Gaza was closed off by Isreal from the rest of the world. I like Isreal. This is wrong. And for you to sit there, probably American, living the good life, and say shit like this, shows you've never been through anything. If you don't know pain, stay off the comment section on stuff like this. Or go watch Scooby-Doo or some shit.
Shit like this is why I support the 2nd ammendment
I know, too funny! Lol
Truth. No one wants Palestinians in their countries. Savages, all of them.
No
Whew! That was a lot.
I‚Äôm sure Israeli children were crying too when Hamas fired at them.
"masses of idiots duped by Islamic Jihad"FTFY
3 year old account and first time ever ever ever posting anything on reddit is here 19 hours ago .. i think ItsKaZoYa is a fake account or a propaganda account especially since he linked to one of the most know russian propaganda idiot out.  not even just that he is also peddling false information about gaza and palestinina and refuses that say hamas has even control over gaza.    and i guess he is ignoring the war crimes / terror recently done by hamas too
Using kids as negotiation is trash. I wish people would stop posting it like it'll make a difference.  It's just throwing emotion into an already u stable climate
Absolutely sir this is so sad. Palestinian or not that is sad. I'm a republican in the United States and I still can see this not right. Yes its been happening for years but we should all try our best to help.
Then they wonder why they still live in fucking shitholes.Utter disease the lot of them.
Hey you little cocksuccker shut the fuck up. That is a CHILD. If you watched your home get destroyed like that you would want revenge too-! You slimy arrogant sack of shit. Your humanity is GONE-! Fuck you.

At least 3 of em
You didn't just kill isrealis you killed canadians Americans and other citizens, if I get the chance I'll go to your country and no I won't say sorry, Canada never lost a war, and we don't intend to start now.
At least they're destroying stuff in their own country for once
Except they bombed their own hospital. STFU dude you are just some Palestine fan boy or whatever.
yeah, looks different in the video than the still.  It's hollow in the butt, maybe an airsoft like you said.
Football fields worth of bodies.
As a Turk, this sorta shit doesn‚Äôt surprise me any more. Stabbing oranges in protest of the Netherlands, burning USD bills in protest of the US (while the economy is in shambles and the conversion rate is 1 to 30), buying large bottles of Coca Cola only to pour them down the drain in protest of Israel, etc‚Ä¶These braindead assholes have major issues when it comes to not knowing where to redirect their pent up anger and idiocy.
So bombing hospitals is just okay now then . There is no justification for this where are they meant to evacuate to exactly ?
Did they raise the price on butter chicken?
did i sell these lands to Israelis.. of course no. Palestinians sold their land to the Israelis. so they sold their lands and you say they are rightful. They could settle this with dozens of different ways but they chose killing young people in the prime of youth in the music festival. And other "Palestinians" are supporting this. yeahh fuck all of them
The mcrib never had a chance.
No, hamas did. Check ur facts
"Yea! That'll sure show....McDonald's? To...not be....uh, yea! Take that fuckers!"Right, because destroying shit definitely makes people want to support your cause, especially the people You've just cost tens of thousands of dollars
So they'll smash up a Mickey D's as it's a symbol of the West, which they hate...all while dressed in Western style clothing. Jeans, hoodies, etc.
Same brother same, unfortunately it‚Äôs just impossible in this situation
That was hard to watch, she‚Äôs terrible.
It was Hamas. End of story.
You're an idiot
There‚Äôs video of a rocket exploding in midair then the explosion is seen below, with a secondary explosion to follow. This attack is from an errant rocket aimed at murdering Israeli citizens. The high death toll is likely because the rocket ended up hitting rockets and other explosive items stored in the hospital by the terrorists. This is also a war crime.
At the end of the day I don't care what nationality the child is... This makes me sad
At this stage there could be a full video with a go pro strapped to the front of the rocked and they won‚Äôt believe it.  In Jordan today the marches were pro Hamas.  Not pro Palestinian but pro the Hamas the people who rape and kill civilians on purpose. So it‚Äôs clear now non of it matters it‚Äôs win or loose and you just pick a side and ignore everything else
Exactly!!!
For the past 70 years Israel didn‚Äôt care about the Geneva Conventions the only difference is now they can‚Äôt hide it
Toros Neza
A) do we for sure know it was merely a parking lot? For the guardian: Footage broadcast from the ground by Al Jazeera showed a huge fire engulfing the **multi-storey building** with bodies, including small children, and widespread debris scattered around.B) how many people do you think can just hang out in a hospital at one time? Given the number of causalities leading up to this, combined with the directive to flee to the south, and the international prohibition against striking hospitals, it seems reasonable that there would be a lot of people at the hospital (and that would overflow to the parking lot). C) my name gripe with the OP was the posting of an acontextual tweet from some random person as supposed ‚Äúevidence‚Äù that the Palestinians are lying about the attack. D) in all likelihood it is too early to tell what cause the explosion. We shouldn‚Äôt let this become another ‚Äúthey are beheading babies‚Äù story.
&gt;Right now no one is winning the morality contest.War makes no concessions for such things. Morality doesn't mean a lot when the stakes are "win or die"
Fuck did Ronald do
I wonder if that man believes the dribble that spews from his mouth.
So what I'm hearing is go roll around in some toxic waste. Got it!

So here is an interesting thought: where were these protests or anger when they learned China was imprisoning, torturing and killing the Uyghurs? A literal TURKISH minority in China?
Shut your assumptive ass up bro no muslim would(should) be okay with the murder of civilians and innocents
America has been funding Israel killing Palestinians for decades.
So someone can jerk off, starting at you through your window, and it's only a crime if you happen to notice?
These people are stronger than I can ever imagine.
I believe they do, and I think a two state solution is the best. The issue of course is do you do it by the 1948 lines, the 1967 lines or my the population at the time being more Jewish or Arab. This is why I believe Israel has been taking over jones in the West Bank it‚Äôs to ensure that if they do negotiate the boundary of a two state solution they can claim a Jewish presence.

God doesn't care about either side
Say what you like...there are no winners here. Just people hurting.
To an extent. Hospitals aren't some magic "can't target me no matter what" armor like some people seem to think they are. For example, If I'm a commander on the front lines in a war, I can't go and set up my headquarters in an active hospital because the people I'm fighting "aren't allowed" to shoot at it, nor am I allowed to station my non-injured troops or store my munitions there. Doing either of these things opens the hospital up to being targeted by military action.
I think first we can start by having conversations about it, all these countries can control as much as they in the areas of power, money, etc. but what we as a people of this world have and will always have is a voice that we can either use to do good or bad. I think a great area start would ask questions, try to get a better understanding of what the people who have lived their full lives think of the situation. then and only then, I believe can we start to move forward instead of this constant stale mate where nothing really ever gets fixed cause everyone just wants to run away from the issue.
Looks like a flare gun.
Fuck Israel fuck Zionist
She has got to be the worst reporter ever!
Wasn't that like McDonald's Israel though? And didn't a McDonald's from another country send money to Hamas (or at least some Palestinian org)?
Yeah exactly. The hospital is still standing. Of course palestinian propaganda won't admit this
Ret dem fight !
Why air strike the _parking lot_ if they are targeting civilians? Why were there so many people in the parking lot, at night, that were killed?
I didn‚Äôt see any similar protests when my good friend Asheem forgot my birthday‚Ä¶üòî
Thx. Any recommendations while I‚Äôm here?
Maybe I‚Äôm just dense but what am I supposed to discern from this tweet from some random person who works for the Australian Strategic Policy Institute‚Äôs subdivision of International Cyber Policy Centre?He makes a claim (that the scene doesn‚Äôt look consistent with an air strike) but provides zero rationale for that position.
"Rape victims reap what they have sown. If only they didn't allow the cancer of resistance to grow within and accepted the inconsensual sex performed on them they would live in society as simply women that had sex with a dude and other than that no one would know the difference between consensual sex and rape."
I'm down voting all the news footage I see here...though this is people actually freaking out and fighting inanimate objects at a fast food joint, so...I'll allow it.Seriously though...I see war footage every day on the news...I come here to see people acting like clowns. People should post a lot of these war videos on another sub or another place entirely, and people need to stop upvoting propaganda and depressing ass war videos. I just want to see more waffle house fights, not actual war. /Rant
:D
Why is it that every time I read an article about this, the party responsible for the hospital bombing changes? I feel like I can't trust a single new source. Do we know at this point whether there is definitive evidence pointing to whether it was Israeli forces or a failed Hamas rocket that hit the hospital?

Them going after hamas itself and not non combatants.   Not shutting off food and power and water to the whole territory.When there is an active shooter in a school in the US do we bomb the school to kill the guy? No, we tactically go in with the goal of stopping him AND minimizing casualties.
These aren‚Äôt people
Edit: deleted because it was posted in the wrong spot
As it turns out the hospital wasn't even hit...
I saw this yesterday and not going to lie, it was actually pretty funny. Youssef is such an intelligent man being capable of bringing dark humor into this issue.
Read the news today.
Israel is being blamed for Hamas starting a war. The Bible speaks the truth about it all.
Is there a tangible difference from Israeli coverage and American?
This caption is misleading due to the fact it is still unknown as to who blew up the hospital.
I assume they will be taking in Palestinian refugees‚Ä¶.. oh wait they don‚Äôt actually give a fuck about those people
Once this video spreads I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll result in a cease fire.
He *will* escalate.
Source it was Israel?
Yep. Get ready for more of our freedoms to be under assault. Now we are going back to being afraid of "terrorists" again. I've already seen this movie.
Palestine bombs itself?
We are all ‚Äúwesterners‚Äù in their eyes.
Nope. There's videos and everything. Hamas/Jihad Islamic rocket.
What did america do tho? This is in israel, a soverign, with attacks being committed by hamas, an Iran funded organization. America hasnt done anything so these people protesting are either uninformed or just plain stupid
You think it was working in the first place? Get real. :)
Can we wait until we have the facts...let's not blame someone until we can definitively say they did it. - I'm not on anyone's side, I just don't like escalating violence because more and more innocent people get hurt which leads to more violence and more pain...it's a horrible cycle that we as humans can't seem to shake.
I hope they didn't damage the ice cream machine.
Boy! Don‚Äôt we feel foolish
Then why did they do it? To free the Palestinians?
Prove it
But when it was realized this DID‚ÄôT ACTUALLY HAPPEN, why wasn‚Äôt the title changed?
Why not? Everyone on both sides of the war is a fucking clown, so he'd fit right in.
bruh hahaha
![gif](giphy|y2i2oqWgzh5ioRp4Qa|downsized)
and zionists as welll
Kill all hamas people
isreael did not bomb it
Can you do the conversion to imperial, American here.
There will be a metric shit-ton more lives lost.
So fucked up that Hamas bombed themselves to make Israel look bad. These ppl are the scum of the earth.0
So now we know this didn't actually happen will people apologise for being duped? Embarrassing stuff.
Because western media is so quick to jump on the bandwagon and report ‚ÄúGaza Officials‚Äù aka Hamas releases as fact.  The first headline I saw on CNN which came out within minutes of the event was:IDF air strike on hospital kill 800 people.  24 hours later it looks more like Islamic Jihad failed rocket crashes in hospital parking lot and kills who knows how many people.  That first headline is out there and people will still claim it to be the truth.   Irresponsible sensationalism passed off as serious journalism is a massive problem that is only going to get worse.
What‚Äôs that‚Ä¶
Upset with Hamas? What kind of news are u watching man?
And why is Lebanon carrying the torch? Sorry, just wondering why these countries won‚Äôt take Palestinian refugees from the war, yet they will show solidarity for something that they don‚Äôt have much to do with themselves.
Truth is the first casualty of war.
Yeah... I had a member of the military tell me that the Hamas rockets can't do what the IDF is saying. SO yeah... Hamas rockets are basically a tank round. You can't blow up a hospital with a tank round.
It‚Äôs just an excuse to vandalize like we saw in the summer riots of 2020. While the cause might have justification, it would be foolish to pretend that it‚Äôs not selfishly motivated.
Yeey let's use war crimes to justify random violence and vandalism instead of actually doing something productive about it
"Trust us bro" is the highly scientific method now used by both sides it seems. First casualty of war is the truth.
I thought it was a ‚Äúhospital‚Äù. This is a parking lot.
I‚Äôll never understand peeping toms especially in the age of instant free porn at your fingertips.
Why do you believe everything they say lol? It's absurd to trust either side at this point.
I think you are correct. The Hamas rockets are basically like a "tank round" at best and it's highly unlikely that it could blow up a hospital. This was told to me by a member of the military in my country.
What Isreal bomb a civilian hospital no way. They just said they didn't do the other one. They must have meant that you should evacuate because hamas is going to bomb the hospital. /s
I don't think the Hamas rockets are big enough to blow up a big hospital? They are shooting rinky dink home made rockets. They can't even blow up the houses they hit.
Do you not understand that you cannot pick one definite side in this conflict??? There is no black and white, no 100% right 100% wrong here. Imagine growing up in a society, average age is 18(!!!) no place to stay almost no food no water no nothing and all you know is there is a certain group of people that took away your land, your freedom, your future. Ofcourse ur gonna want to kill them. But also it is completely understandable that the Israeli people want to stay in their country which they were given and ofcourse they are gonna want to fight for this. Noone should die but you see neither side is completely in the wrong or in the right. A terrorist attack does not justify a genocide. This conflict can not be ended with violence
Leave or get bombed!( If you leave you will also get bombed but we wont say that part )
Too be fair, McDonald‚Äôs has killed way more people than the Israelis and Palestinians combined through heart disease. Lol.
Yeah it‚Äôs just hooligan mindset. The underlying issue or protest they don‚Äôt care too much about what it really is about is going out and acting like a dipshit.
Hospital parking lot was hit by a unguided rocket fired from GAZA after experiencing a failure during launch.   The hospital parking lot was destroyed.  The hospital is still there minus some broken windows.https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1714525590873575600?t=jmalvQpJ34OwKHKAIesT7w&amp;s=19It was not a Isreali attack on the hospital.  The people of Gaza and their sycophants all across the world need to know they are being used as useful idiots by those who want to kill every Jew as if they were Nazis in Hitler's Germany in the  1930s.  Wake up.
I've got some very bad news for you.
Get out.
They‚Äôre just mad they got rid of the McRib
The death of America. No Fast food restaurants will be spared. Billions must fry
lol how old are you, 12?
Must be burger king fans
that's not an M its the golden arches
Lol, was this filmed in the supposed hospital that got bombed? It was an Islamic Jihadist rocket that misfired and exploded in the hospital parking lot
The Big Mac death squads are on their way
The Mc.nuke is on the way
First you are going to need 2 bombs‚Ä¶
And now every Redditor I see is saying Hamas did it. What's going on? Is that just successful propaganda from Israel?
‚ÄúSir the American embassy is under attack‚Äù
Terrified of bombs. Grows up to be a suicide bomber.   Oh the irony.
Why are there no women in this video and how big is this hospital to host 5000 patients.
This is turning into Nazi Germany. ‚ÄúAll you people we don‚Äôt like, for no good reason, have to live in this one place so we can ~~exterminate you~~ move you somewhere safer later.
Welp, had a trip planned to Jordan next month, guess will change destinations now.
Probably same with PFLP
I Don‚Äôt trust social media either‚Ä¶
The ‚ÄúPalestinians‚Äù are victims of their own society, they are reaping what they have sown..They allowed the cancer of Hamas to grow within, if they themselves purged that evil from their society as it popped up along they way they would be fully integrated into the whole of Israeli society as simply guys that pray to a different dude and other than that no one would know the difference between the Jews and the Muslims..
Man, you sure put a whole lot of trust in that one dude when it's the only thing you have to grab onto.
Will they keep this energy to protest against H@m@s? They were so angry about the ‚âà5o0‚âà dead civilians. Will they protest the terrorists that actually did the act?

Considering how McDonald‚Äôs food is shit, this should be done worldwide.
Hamas is a bunch of incompetent morons, just bombed their own hospital. Free Palestine from Hamas.
McDonalds is giving free food for Israeli soliders in Israel
Jumping to conclusions on Reddit?![gif](giphy|Sd3cd0SrUKZEyWmAlM)
Idk man this might be the last straw before Ronald McDonald decides to unleash hell upon these people! He‚Äôs been in hiding just bottling his anger all these years waiting for an excuse to emerge with his wrath!
so you aee what hamas did one week ago for 6 hours but not what isreal has been doing for the last 75 years?? the audacity and the hypocrisy
That will show them!
That'll show em!
&gt;"This attack is unprecedented in scale," said Richard Peeperkorn, WHO Representative for the West Bank and Gaza. "We have seen consistent attacks on healthcare in the occupied Palestinian territory."&gt;Peeperkorn said there so far have been 51 attacks against healthcare facilities in Gaza, with 15 health workers killed and 27 injured.https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/attack-gaza-hospital-unprecedented-scale-who-says-2023-10-17/
absolutely hamas didn't killed those young tourists and civilians in Israel music festival ?!?!?! (fuck you hamas)
Has this been substantiated? Was it bombed by Israel?
You are correct! Same in my state.
Hamas has kidnapped and killed American civilians in this situation. If you are OK with that, then you are just as despicable as the terrorists themselves, and you are welcome to go back to whatever shithole you crawled out of. You are clearly for the enemy here. Fuck you and fuck Palestine
And yet Jordan wants zero Palestinian refugees.  It must be Have-Your-Cake-And-Eat-It-Too-Day in Jordan.
Wherever they‚Äôve been told to be by thier masters
Most mods here should be removed. Ive seen all posts are one sided If they‚Äôre going to let the disinformation thru might as well let both sides do it
It‚Äôs been. It‚Äôs just being televised live now
Biden says it was Hamas missiles and I personally trust Biden on this because Biden is very cautious and I don‚Äôt think he would unnecessarily express an opinion this if he didn‚Äôt have convincing intel.
the real publicfreakout has been publicfreakout the last two weeks
It wasn't even Israelis bomb! Hahahahaha it was their own üòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖüòÖ
there is a reason why their neighbors wont let them in and i suggest you read and educate yourself because what u said couldnt be farther from the truth
Turks are known to do stupid shit like this. Back in time they used to  buy coca cola and pour it onto the street to protest israel. (I am a turk myself)
she probably didnt have access to koolaid..but u seem to have had plenty of zionist koolaid thoo that it went straight to ur head
Can‚Äôt wait till they find out Israel wasn‚Äôt responsible for the explosion‚Ä¶
and you and your zionist midset
How exactly does destroying a McDonalds in Istanbul help the situation?
And has nothing to do with the conflict directly.
&gt;Just idiots thinking they need to be doing something with their anger with the end result it achieves fuck all other than make other peoples lives a little more difficultThat's just called "religion".
Or it‚Äôs people angry at McDonald‚Äôs open support for Israel. That‚Äôs probably more likely than ‚ÄúJust idiots‚Äù
I think it‚Äôs because McDonald‚Äôs began providing Israelis and IDF with free meals after the recent HAMAS attacks. They‚Äôre rightfully angry, why don‚Äôt Palestine get any happy meals too?
That plot is so much more prescient than you even realize. The hacker found the corporate secret and got so pissed off he kidnapped a CEO to try to convince him to tell the world the truth, the CEO wouldn't do it so the hacker got pissed and emotionally held a gun to his head on live TVThat TV became well known, his symbol became an in-universe counter cultural meme.  Not only do corporations use the meme for their own corporate gain, but it foments an angry sentiment through the country.  While trying to pull one more cover-up in the form of a fake assassination attempt, many normal every-day citizens take it on themselves to ALSO commit a politcal assassination - not because they were hacked or controlled, but because they bought into a meme.
Fuck you and Hamas
News headlines evolved as well. Was 500 and idf. How 300 and an explosion.
It perfectly makes sense
It feels like a purchased account, nothing about Israel/Palestine until 10 days ago and now that is all this account is posting about.
‚ÄúHamas doesn‚Äôt have the capability‚Äù yeah they don‚Äôt, however they‚Äôve been receiving money from Pakistan Iran etc that they got from not only the US but china and Russia, yeah they don‚Äôt have the capability, but they‚Äôre given the buying power Not to mention all of the shit our senile president left for terrorists to figure out
This is why it needs to be settled once and for all in Israel, the complete inability to integrate as a mixed society and live in peace ultimately leads to one groups complete elimination. If Hamas/Palestinians won that match, Israel or it rebranded as Palestine, would deteriorate into a 5th world hell hole of complete animalism and poverty.. There is a reason their Muslim neighbors don‚Äôt let them into their countries, not even as refugees, they are feral and they know they wouldn‚Äôt even be a match in their societies!!
How do we know it‚Äôs not a hamas rocket?
Of course it does
And yes I would disregard him because he continues to lie now that hamas did it because the idf proved the claim false
Heyyyyüíñüíñüíñhttps://preview.redd.it/i352hasgwyub1.jpeg?width=677&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=3d3f92c74c808853530fecca58910cbf8bc28489
Their not "lovin it".
He tweeted it in celebrationhttps://twitter.com/MarkKersten/status/1714367614162702612But then once information came out from ISRAELI forces that not a single hamas insurgent was inside the hospital they changed the narrative that hamas shot a palestinian hospital even the idf tweeted about the hospital bombing
Man this chick has drank that Hamas Koolaid by the gallon. What a psycho
Looking at the footage available, it was not a heavy ordinance that killed these people here. It looks like blatant lies by Hamas, and western MSM falls for it immediately.
To be fair McDonalds tastes like shit now. Soggy fries, burger always taste bland, i do like nuggets or desserts but thats it, haven't gone to McDonalds in months.
This is exactly what Hamas wanted.
lol this did not age well üòÇ
There  is footage from several sources showing it was a Hamas rocket landing short. Maybe they shouldn't have hospitals in the overfligjt of their rocket barrages.
Shame it was straight up Palestine who misfired their own rocket and we literally have footage of the entire thinghttps://x.com/OrianShamriz/status/1714365814160175213?s=20Hamas truly are the scum of the Earth and the media will be responsible for bloodshed that occurs in response to the hospital incident
Someones Pants are on Fire
This is the Zionist way.  Hatred of, torture of, murder of anyone who isn't like you. What heroes.
That's rich coming from the guy that is convinced that Israel bombed that hospital and your proof is some Israeli propagandist who you would disregard in any other case except when it confirms your biases.You're worse than someone who doesn't know how to read. You only read what you want to read and ignore everything else.
Not at all. Poland is looking on way to keep as much of them as possible. Poland needs immigrants and Ukrainians are culturally close. It'll be easy to assimilate them (it's already happening). Poland don't want to repeat immigration mistakes of west.
Fair enough.  Facts are facts.
Are you Godzilla? Then yes.
No I literally said that to my mom and she goes ‚Äúwell hamas did worse stuff and beheaded children‚Äù and I replied with ‚ÄúBUT THEYRE NOT HAMAS??? They‚Äôre innocent people???‚Äù And my mom deadass goes ‚Äúwell what about Israel‚Äù i hate when ur having a debate/argument with someone and they literally go into delulu land and make up some shit saying you said something that never even happened
You really don't know how to read do you
How many bags of rice and corn will it take to fix our image? (Only saying this because the argument for US AID Is that it betters our image around the world which I know is wrong)  I mean do we really need to provide military assistance to one of the strongest militaries in the world? Can barely pay our own gov debt
Entirely agree, lost count how many times I‚Äôve seen itHave you seen ‚ÄòIn the Loop‚Äô? (Movie version of the thick of it)It does an equally amazing job at highlighting the craziness in whipping up propaganda for war and and having ministers tow the party line and Britain playing americas lap dog
those AK47 ear rings, LOL!
Would the narrative be different if it was discovered that Hamas was actually responsible for this bombing? This war will be a war of truthful information as well. Trust in the media is at an all time low.
Dear God (pick your favorite)Can you please bring your people home with you? They keep fucking up our planet, please just take them to heaven or hell or whatever bullshit they belive, just get them the fuck out of here.
'No more widdle in me gob?'I could quote that film forever and ever, but in all seriousness the parallels and message is so poignant whenever any religious wars happen. Absolute masterpiece, easily my favourite film.
Yep.  The truth is on a permanent holiday these days.
"Israel's bombing"Or another Palestinian rocket that went off course.You decide. That's the nature of the Palestinian/Israeli conflict in a nutshell.
Lebanon, the land of peace.
‚ÄúBomb boots the chemist, they sell condoms that make me want to bang white chicks‚Äù
Yeah! Meats and Cheeses have no place together.  They must be segregated to protect their identities.  They must never be allowed to be together.
If you look at border/blockade expansion and casualties suffered this is an extremely one sided conflict against the Palestinians and has been for past decades. It doesn't take a genius to look at data.
Totally wrong title.
One is reminded of Four Lions
actually, it's not just from the IDF; it's also from video of the event taken from individuals' phones and posted to social media. I found that Telegram is probably the closest any of us not witnessing this on the ground will get to raw footage that we can attempt to interpret for ourselves. This whole thing a shit show. We know that the IDF will lie to promote their agenda, but we are idiots if we think that Hamas doesn't use the same strategy.
And what is cutting baby heads off and shooting them in their cribs? People try to say they're innocent. Ignorance and complacency isn't the same as innocence. Now Israel will build settlements atop charred Palestinian bones.#subhuman
üíØ Where's the beef?
Looking news now, one would say Russia is doing proper war. /s
Misleading title meant to try and push a narrative, suprise suprise.
Is it really underappreciated though? Don't get me wrong, it's my favorite, but it's consistently ranked in the top 3 and often at the very top of anime lists.
&gt; The Palestinians should be able to stay in their own country without being slaughtered. So should the Israelis. &amp;#x200B;&gt;The pressure should be on Israel to stop the genocide not other Arab nations to take refugees ffsThe pressure should be on the side that seeks the complete genocide of an entire nation and intentionally raped, slit the throats of, and burned alive innocent civilians and dragged their stripped corpses through streets to be ridiculed. Get your bullshit out of here you Nazi apologist.To be very clear - if Palestinians stop fighting, we have peace. If Israelis stop fighting, they cease to exist.
Logic was never their strong point... Why don't they destroy their phones too? This camera were invented in Israel
This is why Turkey being in NATO has always been an oxymoron. Also ironic considering what Turkey is doing to Armenia.
I hope we are not seeing the beginning of an Arabic-Jewish war.
This is how you keep creating generations of hatred and war
I assume their angst is at Israel, America being intertwined and nation that has helped Israel - it kinda goes hand in hand
It's a joke
We‚Äôre 997 world wars away from WWM
How can we explore the depths of it? Every bit of information we see on the main stream news has been nothing but stretched truths or biased information or straight out lies. The division that has been happening world wide is what they the governments want. The true way we end this war is by simply refusing to take a side
Explosion at carpark area, no crater, hospital still intact although window shattered, impossible to cause 500 dead
Ya and then tried to start a civil war ü§£
McDonald's announced that they will be providing food daily to the Israeli soldiers completely free of charge... I'm guessing that's why.
Normally that would make sense, but shouldn't people be upset with Hamas, not America?
That‚Äôs true for the VAST majority of us - we just don‚Äôt want to admit it. Personally, I‚Äôm looking for evidence presented by parties who don‚Äôt seem to have any demonstrated bias. Like if an article‚Äôs source is the Gazan government or the IDF I just can‚Äôt take it at face value. For this incident, I think GeoConfirmed on twitter is pretty credible https://x.com/geoconfirmed/status/1714390254935851272?s=46&amp;t=JP8zCD1RHghM0hwAICxk1g
All it takes is 15 people, could be Iranian agents, Russian agents, or shit even CIA operatives of the US thought it could benefit them in some weird way. Those type of mobs are absolutely terrifying because they are so susceptible to influence; any bad actor could turn that from a very large crowd to an international incident.
This post should be flagged for an outright lie
Update the title or remove the post. Mods need to do thier job!
Wouldn't it be like destroying a Toyota dealership because you hate Israel?
The one guy jogging: "Whoa, lot of people decided to exercise tonight for some reason!"
I wonder what they did once they heard it was a misfire by Hamas...Is there a Palestinian embassy in Lebanon? ü§î
IDF also used the Palestinians as meat shields, when the IDF raided Jericho they used women and children as shields. I also remember Amnesty International accused Israel of using meat shields way back 2009 when IDF attacked Gaza
Welcome to the middle east.
Hamas bomber the hospital and blamed Israel. Stop spreading misinformation.
[Israel releases 'audio of Hamas operatives discussing failed rocket launch' and video showing missile exploding in the sky moments before blast killed hundreds at Gaza hospital](https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12643229/Israel-blast-Gaza-hospital-Palestine-video-rocket-misfire.html)
Israel wipes its ass with the Geneva Convention.
Video probably uploaded from an iPhone.....
I can't tell from one video which is Gaza and which is Israel.  I think I speak for most people in that we would like to know the truth, but we're layman and its very very easy to fool us.
Gullible idiots. All just looking for an excuse to destroy stuff. Who really needs people like this in the world?
Roving pack of wild dogs
An amazing and under-appreciated story that makes you draw parallels with both our society and what it even means to be human, on a very philosophical level. It's a show that makes you think, feel, laugh and cry. For instance: *Ed-ward-o*
Where are all the women?
Holy shit. I literally watched a news report on how that video of the misfire is not related to the hospital as it happened later. Now everyone here is saying naw?
Fuck Mayor McCheese!!!
&gt;Others Who?
I was thinking about making a whip out of vertebrae to help me motivate my slaves...would you be ok with that?

This WAS a massive war, that Israel won already, in 6 days.
I‚Äôve read a few of his books, and they were all good. He gets very into the behavior patterns of killers. But be warned it can get quite descriptive when discussing the actual crime and what was done. All the books I read were on the Libby app, so library books, and were also available as audio books in Libby.
Thank you for the info, I didn't know that.
I don‚Äôt quite see the connection, but good. Fuck McDonalds.
Support UN to move people out of Gaza, to settle them in better places like Iran, Iraq, Egypt, or Saudi. Hamas will no longer have ground and soil to proliferate and eventually out of existence on its own. Or move Israel people to Hawaii. Either way, as long as they are physically separated, problem solved.
That‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business but the Turks.
Lol. America either sends you McDonald's with their burgers or it sends you McDouglas with its bombs.
The Iranian propaganda department is literally copying the methods of Wagner: manufacture outrage, massively spread it, have your agents organize massive protests at embassies to cause a riot and casualties, rinse and repeat.It's absolutely no surprise that the largest "demonstration" is in the largest Hezbollah stronghold, Lebanon.Remember that Russia and Iran are allies (they worked together, hands in hands, in Syria), so the proximity between Wagner and the equivalent Iranian org is more than possible.
The anime is literally based on WW2 Germany
That'll show them
I wonder if they will go protest Hamas when they see the rocket was launched by them.
Nobody should have to fear their parents being abandoned during a bomb threat.
McDonald‚Äôs are sold as franchises. So it‚Äôll be a local business owner who‚Äôs restaurant just got trashed and those who work there not earning any money while it‚Äôs closed. Good job baying mob!
Don't let the truth get in the way of a good demonstrationhttps://x.com/Nrg8000/status/1714535497958334678?s=20
Yea because most Jews aren‚Äôt Zionist or extremist.
A lot of people think that anime has rediculous plotlines. Then you get something like Ghost In the Shell: Stand Alone Complex and at first glance it‚Äôs all future tech cyborg/cyberspace/paramilitary, but the basic plotline is a hacker found out that a corporation kept a perfecty viable natural vaccine off the market because they wanted to push their treatment for a disease that affected people who had cyberbrains. It‚Äôs an amazing anime because of how absurdly REAL the plotline seems if you accept their idea of what will be possible with technology in the future.
Disappointing but utterly unsurprising.  The IDF is about as vile as the worst of hamas.
&gt;Exactly. The title of the post makes it seem like a definite fact. IDF refutes this report and until an outside agency weighs in people should be careful. But f me it‚Äôs Reddit what should I expect.Not only that, but you can go to reddit combat footage and see plenty of video angles of it being a Hamas rocket that had the engine stage fail before falling down into the hospital.
Notice how far down your comment it. And notice how few people have walked back their statements after being proven wrong.
All profit going to US and UK . israel Just spy only . Now a days many Arab's resorce Loosing US. So this war very important to US and UK .
A redditor whos perfectly fine with jews being killed, but not arabs
&gt;Indiscriminately bomb and kill thousands of innocent kids and other civilians in a matter of a few days as collective punishmentExcept thats not even remotely true and you know it. But hey, keep trying your hardest to make Israel look as bad as an organization whos entire existence is dedicated to the Erasure of jews from the world
Thats why Mr. Hitler killed 60 million Jiewsüëç
While true this is really starting to look more and more like a consequence of untrained unethical Hamas dillweeds firing rockets made out of water piping and duct tape near a hospital, having an opsie, and running propaganda in the confusion.The only fault Israel has in this is its role in the root cause and doing so much cruel bullshit the IDF bombing a hospital just kind of sounds like something they would do.
All because the media decided to report an outright lie first
What if I just hate toyota? Should I destroy Japan?
Luckily Hamas has been carefully avoiding such rash moves.
Literally confirmed by nearly every reputable news source at this point
No they don‚Äôt. Just like PALESTINE WAS THE ONE TO BOMB THE OTHER HOSPITAL
Seriously, it was a fully Hamas rocket. There are several videos of it launching, malfunctioning and falling down to earth
Whatch it be owned by a palestinian
Of course it does.
Occam‚Äôs Razor - Hamas botched a rocket attack and is using the carnage to push a victim narrative. What‚Äôs surprising about this?!
*figurative
Why are you underselling this tragedy Israel is bombing billions of people every day and you‚Äôre out here spreading these lies
No such thing as a bad hand job.
I guess they are NOT loving it‚Ä¶
It was an Islamic Jihad rocket but go off king
You mean the crappy Hamas rocket that fell short of its target?
The footage that the IDF posted was from last year, footage of another attack. And Hananya Naftali (Israel Spokesperson) said that Israel bombed the hospital because they thought Hamas was hiding there, but he deleted the tweet after the IDF posted "it wasn't us"
Good, everyone should destroy McDonald's. The world would be a healthier place.
Incite*
McDonald's all over the middle East recently donated millions of dollars in aid money to help the victims of gaza prior to this attack in TurkeyThe reason for that is that McDonald's has been supporting Israeli troops in Israel so there was a massive boycott campaign against it
Exactly, killing civilians is the name of the game for them. They probably cheered when they found out.
They also don't protest like this when the Cowboys lose; equally meaningful point lol
You and the other people are trying way to hard to spread misinformation based on nothing basically.I would suggest you check your sources or stop wasting peoples time, because only a fool would bite to the crap you and the others are so desperately trying to convince everyone about.And I reiterate, I am a impartial bystander.It's abit funny as if any of you on reddit have a part in this.None of you are going to do anything about it anyway
Although the killing of Israeli citizens was atrocious. The Israelis have to ask how much of this have they brought on themselves. Palestinians living in Israel - who provide vital labor and services - are abused daily, and their homes, and land are stolen, using the courts and the army. Plus, with civilian help - someone goes and lives in these stolen houses. This has been going on for years and has accelerated under Netanyahu's government.
That clown is always supporting genocide and terrorism.The Hamburgler is actually a Hamas escapee from an Israeli prison.Don't eat the Big Mac or the propaganda.
Yeah, that made sense.Then McDonald's will retaliate and they will get upset.
I'm sure Poland expect many to return at the end of the war.

Exactly both part should be held accountable for their acts
Israel did not bomb the hospital. Islamic Jihad did. Get it straight.
Correction: Hamas misfired/intentionally fired a rocket into these people. Just like they blew up the convoy the other day. Their biggest weapon in this conflict is propaganda to divide the west.
You are absolutely right to be angry. But you don't do the same  when Erdogan ethnically cleanse Kurds or funds Aliyev to ethnically cleanse Armenians. You cannot support the oppressed and the oppressors at the same time.
What will they do when they find out that Hamas terrorists are a bunch of liars?  Their rocket blow up in the parking lot of the hospital. Look at the pictures.
It is fake news because it exposes Israel's lies, of course. If its not Israel, why did they delete their tweets yesterday when the world exposed it? It is a criminal act and anyone who agrees with it is a terrorist like them
It's not going to make a difference. Israel will bomb them if they say they will.
Ronald be like ‚ÄúI‚Äôm Irish I‚Äôm Irish‚Äù leave me out of this!
Yes there are, because their inconsistency makes them look disingenuos, hypocritical and straight up anti-semitic if they only protest when its against jews.
If Hamas had missiles of that power, why did it not strike it at Tel Aviv, but rather strike it at a hospital containing Palestinians that it was already helping?
I'm pointing out the irony and hypocrisy. Out of all the people, you'd think that Jewish people would have the most compassion and humanity.
lol thats like going up to a stranger and saying "im going to kick you in the balls, right in the nuts" and then you kick them in the balls and its ok, cause you warned themor maybe not exactly like that but yeah right in the nuts

Facts don't matter to antisemites
Thats why honorable Mr. Hitler killed 60 million Jiewsüò≠
I'm sure they will now shift their anger after it was proven the hospital was hit by a Hamas misfired rocket, like reasonable people. Right? Right?
Same happened in Lebanon with Syrian refugees.
Israel: dammit I should stop bombing them or they will destroy another McDonald‚Äôs
We already know what happening. Hamas killed more civilians and won‚Äôt let a crisis go to waste is blaming Israel. What we have here is bots spamming misinformation about it to create hate against Israel to deflect from Hamas. It working very well by the comments. Tens of thousands of people on social media will never double check this story and are running with ‚ÄúIsrael bombed a hospital‚Äù.
Israel denies that it was them.Israel is not attacking them for being Palestinian. It is attacking them for firing missiles and killing innocent Israelis on October 7th.There are no settlements in Gaza. There have not been since 2005.The illegal settlements are in the West Bank and that is run by a separate government.
By far the best anime. Mustang is a g

100% its israel done this bad.
That'll be $4.99
I never said or implied idf didn‚Äôt do it too.
Even Biden is saying it looks like it was Hamas but is waiting for us intelligence to verify.  I'll wait for the US government on this one and not the Internet.
Not when Hamas is having a party on the roof.The Israeli Department of Information.
IDF uses Palestinian people as shields too. So I think Israel is the bigger hypocrite. Hamas told people to stay and not evacuate while Israel dropped flyers saying they don‚Äôt want to hurt them and then what happens? They get bombed en route! [here is this](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-palestinian-israel-children/palestinian-children-tortured-used-as-shields-by-israel-u-n-idUSBRE95J0FR20130620)[another example](https://www.btselem.org/video/20180329_human_shield_in_jericho)
The two biggest casualties of this war are Palestinians and McDonald's
For context, this was the during the Amestris' occupation of Ishval (and Amestrians being white blue-eyed European coded and Ishval being brown skin Muslim coded). Then the Amestris government ordered a occupation in Ishval - and a lot of characters, being military officers, were active in killing Ishvalans.Geez, this anime was way more connected to real world elements than I thought of.
Some people treating this whole situation as if it was new. Its been happening for over 75 years people.
Considering the ability their Iron Dome has to have to reliably shoot down missiles before they reach the ground I don‚Äôt find it surprising that they would be able to identify a Hamas rocket and track its flight path right away.
Mcdonalds in Turkey are actually owned by an Arab cooparation. Also those attackers are speaking Arabic as far as I can tell, so mostly illegal migrants in ƒ∞stanbul. All the Turkish shoutings I could hear are saying "Don't do it".
Theres just no winners in this, regardless of sides. People die pointlessly.&amp;#x200B;Its a sick and cruel world. And that won't change anytime soon either.
These poor innocent people have nothing to do with what's going, just living the best they can. Both sides should be held accountable and condemn for the warcrimes and heinous acts committed. War is not pretty.
Attackers are shouting in Arabic, Turkish shoutings go "Don't do it". Probably refugees attacking it.
All based on a lie. Like all their sci-fi books.
Way to do absolutely nothing usefull except ruin a fellow citizens franchised business. Fucking idiots.
These idiots could care less about the conflict, they just want to break things. Low effort, low reward type of people. I make sure these people stay well the fuck away from me.
Shit would definitely hit the ceiling!
Free The Hamburgler ‚úäüèºüçî‚úåüèº
Just a reminder to the world that false flag operations exist.
Casually committing warcrimes is cool to them I guess. Why target a hospital in the first place.
Article 18 of the 1949 4th Geneva Convention.Civilian hospitals organized to give care to the wounded and sick, the infirm and maternity cases, may in no circumstances be the object of attack but shall at all times be respected and protected by the Parties to the conflict. However, if the hospital is used for warlike purposes, it loses its protected status. In such cases, it becomes a legitimate target.It goes on to say that if the hospital is targeted, then the attacking force has to give fair warning to the civilians insideSo the question is now is there really a Hamas target within the hospital?  Because if there is, then Hamas guilty of using human shield.So it appears that in reality, Israel are doing everything by the book to avoid being accused of war crimes. whether evidence of being fabricated or not is a different question.
You scumbags play the victims real well. Yes let's all forget why this is happening.  The group you support is the sole reason your country is in ruins. They knew exactly what would be the outcome. So you should send a letter to your local hammASS terrorist thanking them for the collateral damage.
How‚Äôs does it feel to drink propaganda and enjoy it?
US shouldn't back Israel for this. Casually committing warcrimes Is cool then huh? Why target hospitals.
I heard malfunctioned missile of Hamas actually caused that. Israel supported it with video footage. I'd be careful with similar headlines...
The BBC series is also excellent.
I can‚Äôt speak to the validity of how big  of a segment of the population of Gaza actually supports HAMAS. But you do know HAMAS is the governing body of Gaza right? Anything coming from the Gaza health ministry is literally terrorist sponsored media. Not saying death toll is wrong haven‚Äôt seen an update yet anywhere else. Just saying you should take anything coming from Gaza health ministry with a healthy scoop of distrust. Not that you shouldn‚Äôt be doing the same for media from anywhere your consuming it.The unfortunate ugly truth of war is innocent civilians get caught in the Crossfire. As some one else state Israel‚Äôs is not directly targeting civilians. HAMAS targets civilians, beheading,raping, kidnapping, and killing approx. 1,900 civilians.That being said what would an appropriate response be from Israel? Just lay their and take it and say oh good game? To just up and leave there land? Which we all know isn‚Äôt going to happen so thats not a realistic answer. I‚Äôm genuine curious about this because I want to know how people that are mad at Israel‚Äôs response (not saying I support everything they have done) think Israel should have responded to this attack. What would have been appropriate response to this attack in your opinion?
Never seen this many mfs
There is a high probability that among this crowd there can be conservative Kurds( these guys mostly vote for the akp pr similar parties ) who are not different than a conservative Turk.
So question, when did I justify any of that? When did i argue any of that is right? You do realize just because I'm not screaming like a lunatic in protest doesn't mean I support these actions. People like you though, will see someone voicing their concern about a singular point, and suddenly their in support of the opposition.You realize I can say boats aren't that great and that doesint automatically mean I like cars and planes.So when somebody voices an opinion about a conflict, it's pretty stupid to assume they automatically support the other side simply over the voicing of a single point.
Wonder how the road to the Palestinian embassy in Jordan will look like tonight =)
if you think any israelis make it out alive with the jihad or hamas options you are willfully ignorant
haha they won‚Äôt care
Lmao pre the number of dots. Think you might find I was right.
*PIJ accidentally bombed a hospital parking lot. There is no collapsed hospital. The cars are burned from fuel fire from a makeshift rocket, not blown up by high yield munitions.

It is probably owned by an Arab anyway
Lebanon already hosts a great amount of Palestinians
How the fk this subreddit became an Hamas propaganda megaphone
Jordan is more than half Palestinian refugees. Also Jordan is a poor country with low resources (housing, water, etc) so dumping millions more refugees on them would be an existential crisis. Jordans do show a lot of solidarity with the Palestinian cause though, in ways that they are able.
I believe Al Jazeera has walked back those claims now. They have certainly deleted the posts. not to say that it could be confirmed again later but there is a lot of misinformation flying around which is why sane people are waiting for the dust to settle a bit.
Israel didnt bomb it though.
Israel before the bombing was boasting about flatting gaza into dust, and right after the bombing of the hospital Israeli from deleted posts was saying hamas we're present and they did them a favour by mercy killing them because no doctors and medicines. All that from Israeli officials. The cat is out of the bag.
This would be like destroying a Toyota dealership because you hate Japan.
Imagine what they were saying during World War 2.

"Peaceful" protest
I don‚Äôt condone the violence to non participating civilians in the conflict between Israel/Palestine, but fuck me Palestine and those who side with them have a habit of causing destruction &amp; violence, then playing the victim card to the global audience.
 It true. A Hamas bomb failed to fly and landed in the hospital. Terrorists killed people.
60% of jordan is palestinian refugees not allowed to go back. So go fuck yourself.
Is Poland the Sinai desert?
Shut tf up
Good one buddy.
What the fuck does this achieve exactly. This is just assholes being assholes for the sake of being assholes. Fuck these cunts.
The IDF have released an intercepted call between two apparent Hamas terrorists saying that missles were launched from the cemetery behind the hospital. This interview contains their radar analysis of the path of the Hamas launched rockets, and a transcript translated and spoken by the Israeli admiral: https://news.sky.com/story/israel-hamas-war-israel-says-it-will-release-evidence-which-it-claims-shows-an-islamic-jihad-rocket-hit-the-gaza-hospital-12986662The call could be fake, but in combination with the video we see of Hamas launching rockets just before the hospital is hit and the video shows one of the rockets veering off to the side.I think one thing is for sure and that is to say it's difficult to lay the blame on either Israel or Hamas definitively. I personally believe the evidence we've saw points towards it being a Hamas rocket which failed, and not an Israeli missle.Edit: of course, instead of addressing any of my points, I'm just downvoted instead because you've already made your mind up that Israel are guilty.
this is the problem with this sub, ALOT of people see Hamas as palestinian resistance to the occupiation without realizing that hamas are just bloodthristy terrorists that are not fighting for palestine and would use them as human shields if they could
the answer is the same it has always been STOP THE TERRORISM AND SIGN A PEACE DEAL
Been watching some of the livestreams from gaza and 2 days ago at night you'd see a rocket barrage go out from like 200m left of a hospital that the camera was pointed at, you can tell its a hospital as its the only building with lights. Theyre firing from within close proximity of hospitals. The explanation of the idf about the secondary explosions sounds plausible, and hamas denying journalists to enter the site is telling aswell. And to top it off the redicilous laughable number of 500 killed...  Ive seen people claim it was a jdam, if that was a jdam then there would be nothing left of that hospital.
That's just traffic
I'm so confused... I've seen good geo-location based evidence that it was a Hamas rocket. Pro-Palestinian twitter keeps arguing that it was an Israeli rocket based on its explosive power.   Waiting for the Guardian, Reuters or AP to tell me wtf happened.
Jordan has a huge amount of Palestinian refugees.
McDonald‚Äôs: ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Umm not entirely true. US did around ~19000 airstrikes over four years from 2015-19 in Yemen.
bout 30 light years
Cause, meet effect.If you're looking for an apology, ask over at r/hamas.
You're retarded.
Any source on them being told to evacuate other than "they said they were told to leave"?
Sure, that makes sense.
Thank youüëç
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
The one in Gaza did the same I beleiveMcDonald‚Äôs war
Tell that to Hamas seeing as the missile came from Gaza and is geotagged and recorded as such. It wasn‚Äôt deliberately fired at then hospital, it failed over it.
So, call for another mass genocide this time just for another religion? Genius.
Palestinians have tried to overthrow governments/monarchies in Lebanon and Jordan when alot were allowed over.
Several Muslims celebrated even here in America. It wasn't just Palestinian Muslims it was considered a victory for the entire nation of Islam. Now however your making young men want to join these terrorist groups. Imagine having in a few weeks your family killed, the home you had in rubble and America in support of these attacks. Do you really want more Americans killed in another "war on terror"?
56+ years of occupation, stealing land and segregation.
Jordan doesn't like Palestinians because they tried to overthrow the Jordanian government when Jordan took them in.
They actually do, they're even using western weapons to do it.
I am wondering what's the angle, what is the ulterior motive for people to willingly and pretty obviously post disinformation and than attacking everyone in the post with complete nonsense arguments.I am sensing a campaigne here.Maybe Hamas, Iran, or Russia even?Keep your fake shit and fuck offRespectfully yours a impartial bystander to this conflict
Yeah it couldn‚Äôt be the makeshift missiles made by Hamas and the Palestinian Jihadists failed above the hospital, even though there‚Äôs geotagged footage of that being the case.
And this accomplishes what?
Stop bombing civilians and hospitals and the public won't be so quick to believe that Israel did it. Pretty simple.
This was a massive claim. 500+ people dead at a hospital. Of fucking course you should wait before jumping to conclusions about something that horrendous without any evidence. If the only thing that matters to you is your side, and not the actual truth, then I guess I can understand why you wouldn't care.
&gt; They are supplying Israeli Soldiers with free food.some local franchises are doing it, not "McDonalds the corporation is doing it"
The damage to the hospital was essentially isolated to the parking lot, leaving some burned cars and cracked pavement.Had that been an Israeli strike that parking lot would‚Äôve been a crater.
It now seems pretty clear that Israel did not bomb it. Hamas fucked up
The real infiltration would be giving the IDF tacobell before a major operation.
What does mcdonalds have to do with it? They make sub par cheeseburgers
Nice joke
Man kicks down your door 100 times a year for the last 70 years. Your door gets kicked down again. On no better not jump to conclusions!
That doesn't excuse anything. Don't jump to conclusions when you have no evidence. It's that simple.
Nope humanity died since 1948
There are times when tear gas just isn‚Äôt going to do anything except make the crowd even more angry. But police are taught how to act, not how to think üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
It's also possible Hamas stored other rockets or explosives either in or near the hospital, thus causing a huge explosion when the bomb/rocket from the sky hit it. This is all total speculation and I don't think we'll conclusively know the answer to who did it and what did it for a long time, if ever.
Hamas: "gotta pump up those fake numbers"
Fake news. It was Hamas. Everyone know it.
This show their intelligence.
Hamas evidently.
No but they have a seat on the security council which means they might as well be the only country in the UN.
Seeing picture of the hospital, where would 5000 people even hide.
That... will show them! I guess?!
Can we stop spreading misinformation? There are already tons of evidence that suggest It was an Hamas failed Rocket.Also Who the fk can really thing Israel would bomb an hospital the day before US president go in Israel? How can you be that stupid lol
Or the Kurds or the Greek Cypriots in Northern Cyprus‚Ä¶
The heck is this reasoning? I shouldn't help if I see someone getting assaulted because the attacker should just stop assaulting them
I'm not sure I'm following who would be side A or B in this case and the nuanced thing is that there's sides A, B, C, D and E here if you think about regular Palestinians and Israelis as just people trying to live in peace, while Hamas, IDF and Settlers being antagonistic. But I digress, if we just abtract it to letters...I can't shake off the fact that from (according to the UN data) just 2008 up until this October attacks there have been 6407 "A" civilian fatalities vs 308 "B". There's definitely a one-sidedness to this conflict if A is getting slaughtered at orders of magnitude higher than B.
Uh, they're doing a lot more than just stalking...
They're gonna feel really stupid when they find out it was hamas/pij that misfired a rocket. Guess they'll do the same to the Palestinian embassy.
It difficult to know.Both options are completely plausible.
They just wanted that Mcflurry
fuck off
"I should not help this little kid get away because the pedophile should not be after it in the first place"I hope you understand how stupid your argument is.
Israel did not bomb the hospital.It is confirmed to be a PIJ rocket misfiring and blowing up the hospital's parking lot. Nowhere near 500 dead.
Well there goes McDonald‚Äôs peace theory
Except that they kinda do?? Everybody sold them weapons and the US even actively participated...From France, the UK, Germany, Spain to the US, everybody had no issues providing them with arms.
Yeah, I am being diligent. Another guy linked a video saying it was geoconfirmed, but that vid has 2 distinct explosions and has no sound. The very first video I saw from yesterday was a whistle into a single explosion. So one of them is fake/from another incident. It's hard to believe Hamas as they will look for anything to pin on Israel and it's hard to believe Israel b/c their propaganda is immense.
There is geolocated, time stamped video showing a Hamas rocket barrage, I‚Äôm which one rocket fails and end up landing in the area of the hospital. So this really doesn‚Äôt look like it was an Israeli strike. Hamas will definitely do everything to propagandize this blunder though.
McDonald's doesn't operate directly in Israel.
&gt;  OSINT is confirmingFYI, one dude on twitter isn't "OSINT".
No just literally anyone besides Israeli and Palestinian coverage.
That is basically the plight of every refugee. They should all be able to stay in their own country but, for one reason or another, they have been forced to flee.
Propaganda sub in full force i see. Shameless.
I bet there alot of ways to fight hamas like real fighters on the ground not destroying every house a hamas member could be in and killing woman and children
So much evidence now it‚Äôs a Hamas rocket. But all these people are fine with all these rockets working. I.e hitting an Israeli hospital.  Thats all good and dandy.  Shows this is just a religious war.
There are tons of claims made by hundreds of people check twitter or any a few news sources to see the dispute. Ultimately, it is currently still uncertain.Hamas can not be trusted as news source they keep on saying no Israel civilians were killed even though their own troops have 1000s of hours of GoPro footage showing the opposite.Also be suspicious of Israeli news sources though I do think they are more reliable.
Cut all food supplies , water , electricity Making gaza impossible to live in
The truth is we can‚Äôt rule out Hamas and definitely not Israel. We truly will never know like we haven‚Äôt known what the fuck to do there in 75+ years.
Everyone wouldn't be so quick to jump to conclusions if Israel hadn't been bombing civilians, hospitals, and first responders for decades.
Yea killing isreali civilians is horrible  but killing innocent Palestinian is ok for you i don't get the point you are trying to explain. Nothing in these world can justify killing of more than 1000 child in fucking 10 days
And and massacres that happened in 1948  by Zionist militias is ok ( why people don't call this an act of terror )
‚Ä¶ makes for bad hand jobs.
Your second point is actually really important and people should consider it seriously.  There is no easy answer and both sides of the opinion are valid, but please consider this.  If I stripped away all context, and told you side A killed only one person while side B killed 50 people.  Let's assume both attacks roughly advanced their sides' impact in the war.  It would not be crazy to make the assumption that side A was more strategic and had more restraint.  It looks like side A values life more.  It appears to be some sort of targeted attack whereas side B might be attacking more indiscriminately with less regard for life.  You might go as far to say, side A was right and side B was wrong.If the context to this situation was side A killed 1 20-year old civilian in a terroristic way and then published the video.  Where side B killed 50 adult soldiers, would that change your opinion on who had the moral high ground?  Should the motivations of the sides be considered?  Does that even matter?  50 people are dead vs 1.
Mental gymnastics gold medal awarded
Idk care about hamas i care about Palestinians even in the west bank were hamas doesn't exist they kill innocent Palestinians
This has been proven to be a self-goal, Hamas rocket
The velvet hand inside the iron glove...
The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) has been tracking deaths in the conflict since 2008 and its data shows that 5,600 Palestinians died up to 2020 while 115,000 were injured. 250 Israelis died during the same period while 5,600 were injured.
https://x.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390254935851272?s=20
R u actually asking? Why do Israelis want Palestinians out of Gaza?
Who is giving the casualty numbers?  Whose purpose does it serve to blame Israel and inflate the casualties?Besides, the rocket kill count comparison is complete apples and oranges.  A rocket within densely populated Gaza vs a rocket into Iron Dome-protected Israel?
&gt;As someone with very little knowledge of this subject what does freeing Palestine look like what is their desired outcome?  Do they want the jews out of Israel? Depends on the organization.PFLP? A secular Marxist-Leninist state.Fatah? They are social democrats and largely support a two state solution.Palestinian Islamic Jihad? Jews can be allowed to stay so long as they are willing to live under an Islamic government.Hamas? Since many Israelis have dual citizenship, they will be deported to their home nation, or whatever nation will take them. If they resist, they will be executed.
I wouldn't call it for "entertainment"still, what they did is wrong, entertainment or not
How can you be this out of date. You posted this like an hour ago when the videos showing the rockets launching and the failed rocket were already published.Wasn't Israel, also doesn't seem it was hundreds of people but instead about 10-20 cars in a parking lot...so no it was in fact not justified because they didn't do it.
Oh wait to see 'Murica financing them so
Do we even know if the death toll is accurate? Satellite images show that only a parking lot was destroyed? The hospital still intact
I wonder how far out the free fire line is‚Ä¶.
Yo for real?
You've met the middle east before right?
Why should they have to? The Palestinians should be able to stay in their own country without being slaughtered. The pressure should be on Israel to stop the genocide not other Arab nations to take refugees ffs
It's their Starbucks I guess.
I love how on message bords and youtube everything is deleted by one persons push of a button. Thats scary to me. Let the idiots speak so we can see through them
So you believe that a single rocket misfire killed more people by a factor of about 20 than every single rocket launched into israel since 2001‚Ä¶COMBINED?And that is more believable to you than Israel attacking a hospital after they straight up say that they want to raze Gaza, have dropped over 7000 bombs and leveling buildings, have said that all Palestinians are considered combatants, and literally warned that they were, wait for it, going to attack hospitals, and actually says they bombed the hospital (before walking it back)?You do you, boo.
Holy shit millions being bombed daily that‚Äôs horrific
American taxpayers paid for that rocket.
People who don't read history literally say this every year.
Imagine if Hamas was issuing a warning before each missile and used that as an excuse to justify bombing residential areas in tel Aviv... wtf? They are targeting extremely important infrastructure, hospitals of all places amid all the civilian casualties gaza already has... destroying the whole fucking place little by little. In what fucked up backwards reality is it ok to kill 500 civilians because you suspect there might be a few Hamas soldiers amongst them?
Yes, they do. Certain politicians and  corporations want you to believe that all news is fake news, because then they can get away with whatever they want. They want you to think there is no reality, there are no facts --  other than what they say is reality and factual.It's an old strategy and one that Hitler used in Germany. He called the media "L√ºgenpresse" (fake news) to get people to disregard the disturbing facts being reported by journalists.   I would trust quality media sources over any of the propaganda you'll find on social media.
He could be traffic in Lebanon. I mean, pic a video, add a fake description, here we go.
If they are picking sides they likely are uneducated and refuse to do so. Not a sane person in the world looking in on this would pick a side so nonchalantly.
As if Israel dosent kill and bomb millions of families on a daily basis, But when the oppressed fight back you speak out. You my freind have crazy logic.
I'm still trying to wrap my head around it. I used to hang out not far from here at a hotel bar that didn't even open until like 3amLots of amazing stories are told just outside by all the taxi drivers that gather there. That included refugees from different wars. They would let me drink a beer and hang with them and practice Arabic. Occasionally they'd all hush as an Iraqi refugee came forward and they watched how we would interact lol
[Geoconfirmed.](https://x.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390254935851272?s=20)Also, there's now daytime footage of the impact site and it looks [nothing like prior Israeli munition impacts.](https://x.com/EliotHiggins/status/1714525755554615554?s=20). Almost no impact crater in the parking lot and all the surrounding buildings are intact.
There's an anime called Fullmetal Alchemist where a police state gathered along the borders of a city/race that had been in uprising. A single little girl was shot and that started everything. Gave the police state the backing they needed b/c the winner gets to decide who shot first. It wasn't pretty.
Now we also have [a picture of the damage](https://twitter.com/Osinttechnical/status/1714525590873575600). The blast hit the parking lot, matching up perfectly with the video. No impact crater, matching up perfectly with a misfire, and it didnt directly hit the hospital. The hundreds of dead from this instance was clearly just a lie.
I'm safe. All these Texans are just gonna shoot the nuke outta the sky...right? right?
If in fact they are giving a warning to evacuate then it is most likely being used as a Hamas base of operations.  If a country was going to straight up commit a war crime they would just do it and not announce it first.
Because they already experienced Palestinians, who tried to overthrow their government and kill their king. Yet, they can still be against Israel's treatment of Palestinians.
Shut UP mothr... Fu.. Er
I haven't seen anything other than Israel claiming it was a Hamas rocket. Can you point me where you learned it was a Hamas rocket that hit the hospital?
There's always gatekeepers and whatabouters
Ridiculous behavior by some beef bacon eaters they probably wanted to eat it in protest of real pig bacon. I spent a month in the Middle East and they kept pushing that beef bacon like it was the real pork bacon. Guess what it isn‚Äôt bacon it‚Äôs beef cold cuts!!!!
Israel as well.
All hamas propaganda channels (like what this subreddit has become) say it was the IDF. So still no credible sources out there.
McDonald's is a franchise, the owners of that store are probably from Istanbul.
Yeah all my Israeli propaganda channels are saying it was hamas, why do people saying the opposite? Weird.
Hamas Missile Misfire
You only have Hamas' word that hundreds were killed. Think.
Hey look those idiots don‚Äôt even know where we live
I'm not picking sides on this issue, in fact, I hate both sides equally.  However, when I heard "Israel bombed a hospital" I had to look into it.  Most up to date videos I see clearly show a set of Hamas rockets being shot into Israel, and one of the rockets malfunctioning and landing in that hospital. Its a simple google search away my dude.
Oh we got more ammo güòÇ
Yes isreal is guilty obviously
No it did not bomb the hospital.
I live a about a 10 minutes from the pentagon. Instant incineration
Amazing how no one could fathom it being the Hamas rocket that was shown actually crashing into the hospital.
howdy there octogenarian redditor
here's a hint: the ones that are launched *from* Gaza are not Israeli.
This is where you choose to educate yourself on the topic? Sheesh
Yes, but the US is not the only country in the UN. This is not okay and we should not be passively watching fucking genocide happen.
Now ask them how they feel about the mistreatment of Armenians by the Turks and Azerbaijanis. I‚Äôll wait.
Isn‚Äôt like Hamas respects the Geneva convention at all lmao
Are they all franchises? Are any of them corporate?
[They are supplying Israeli Soldiers with free food.](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/israel-hamas-war-mcdonalds-faces-backlash-for-providing-free-meals-to-israeli-soldiers/articleshow/104445078.cms?from=mdr)Edit: Still doesn't justify destroying some poor guys franchise.
&gt;their relationship is unlike any other in the world. It‚Äôs truly magicalPalestinians: Can we evacuate into Jordan as refugees?Jordan: no
If by ‚Äúcoherent analysis‚Äù, you mean a bunch of idiots who literally automatically trust something because a Hamas spokesperson said so, then yes.
&gt; The US doesn‚Äôt control Israel, despite whatever the Islamic media might claim.We just give them 3 billion dollars a year because we have too much money. For funsies.
This is again misleading. The video of the aljazeera footage showing the explosions happened an hour before the actual attack on the hospitalhttps://twitter.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1714386960150597780?t=v6tePgKavKmgYQAF2E_axQ&amp;s=19
Most of the things they touch or use on a daily basis are American and they go destroy a McDonalds lol - truly brain dead hypocrites ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sure they uploaded this using a non American phone / tech or social media ‚Ä¶
They don't understand franchises.
I understand the anger and it is totally justified but everyone needs to fucking wait before assigning blame without absolute certainty here. God damn it. You nor I, nor anyone in this thread, knows what happened yet. Be responsible and wait for more info.
Bet Ronald McDonald will think twice about launching another air strike now‚Ä¶.
I said I wasn‚Äôt talking about the 40 babies lmfao read between the lines lmfao
As someone with very little knowledge of this subject what does freeing Palestine look like what is their desired outcome? Do they want the jews out of Israel? From what i understand the Palestinians wouldn‚Äôt  be willing to emigrate even if someone was willing to take in 2+million refugees.
I see what you did there
It represents america but as someone has rightfully pointed out, vast majority of those restaurants are franchised ownedJust idiots thinking they need to be doing something with their anger with the end result it achieves fuck all other than make other peoples lives a little more difficult
What's your point? Don't hold Israel accountable because Saudi Arabia also kills Yemenis? What kinda BS is that? Here, let me educate you. Jordan has a lot of Palestinians. The largest Palestinian population outside of Palestine. Jordan is responsible for Palestinian houses of worship in Palestine, including al aqsa mosque and even oversees the Palestinian education system. The relationship between those two countries and people is unlike any other in the world.
&gt; CheyenneHow far is Akila City from your place?
Vidoos say otherwise.
They gonna feel real upset if it's confirmed it was a failed rocket from Gaza..
What the mcdonald do?
Why are people so eager to believe Hamas are not bad? Seems like some one-upmanship as opposed to rational judgement, or better still, awaiting the truth
Saudi Arabia also had the support of the west, no one intervened and 380k people died. The conflict causes starvation and water shortages. So Palestinians lives are worth more than Yemenis lives?
McDonalds is a franchise so these pricks have just smashed up some local guys livelihood for entertainment.
I guess Istanbul can‚Äôt-stand-it-open.
They mean billionaire funded mainstream media outlets/s
Not if you‚Äôre above the law and are gods favorite goodboi.

Disclaimer: I'm completely clueless as far as military grade payloads go...  That being said, I've also only seen two videos: the one of the hospital getting bombed and the "conclusive proof" it was Hamas. The latter shows a rocket getting hit in the air or something and then falls to the ground, exploding with a small explosion. The former looks like it destroyed half a city block... does Hamas actually have rockets of that magnitude?
IDF also said they have voice recordings confirming this, which they said will be released as evidence
Man this shit is getting fucked.
Yea of course, he's saying we're not repeating Nakba 1948 again.
Okay. Why can‚Äôt they just protest what they want to protest? There‚Äôs prereq‚Äôs now?
This is scary AF! All it takes is like 15 people to start running towards and a stampede ensues. I‚Äôd get the fuck outta there.
You think a group of people who 75 years ago had this same thing happen to them would learn.
Thats why Hamas has Operations hidden under hospitals
I don‚Äôt think they have an Israeli embassy there or other common diplomatic channels. The US is a close ally of Israel and a supporter/partner in this area. I assume they see this as the next best thing
I see you're also misslead by propaganda
If Palestinians leave israel is taking over Gaza and they are NOT coming back. If israel is so concerned for civilian safety, why don‚Äôt they let them into the mainland? Better yet, why do they bomb places they told people to evacuate to? Fuck israel. Fuck apartheid.
Failed Hamas rocket launch.  They did it to themselves and are trying to blame the Israelis.  When will Palestinians learn who is their *real* enemy?
Not supporting how Israel is handling this does not equate to supporting Hamas or terrorists. Are you ok with the 1000+ children that have died as a direct result of idf bombings?
I mean it's been confirmed that Hamas loves to hide its weapons and munitions in soft targets like schools and hospitals. The rocket can come down and light those off causing the massive explosion
Ironic
It‚Äôs okay guys they‚Äôre martyrs. Hamas literally recruits ‚Äúcivilians‚Äù to shield terrorist installations with the promise of heaven.
Israel learning from Russian
Is there any proof yet that it was the israelis? Because there seems to be more proof that it was a hamas missile
You're welcome :)
This could be a massive war
I was just watching coverage last night from inside the hospital, everyone that hadn't/couldn't leave went there, because who in their right mind would bomb a fucking hospital...
Nope, not a word from the countries supplying weapons to the Saudis either. Complete devastation in Syria, Yemen, Libya, and now Palestine and nary a peep
There have been no confirmations as to who launched said missile, stop spreading misinformation.
Reputable news still exists?
It's one of the great historical messes, no need to choose a side.  They both make good points and both sides do horrible things.   For me, it makes more sense to condemn individual horrible things, but also with the awareness that I'm a complete noob on the topic and it seems both sides have reasons to think their existence is on the line.   It's just tragic.
I have strong bones. Feel free to use my femur as a club until you can secure a rile.Good luck üëç
Ah, Cheyenne Mountain. Remember watching a video on them, forgot it was in Colarado Springs.Yea you fucked lmaoooo.
Rockets came from Gaza, nice fake news brah
Cheyenne Mountain contains the central defense complex for the entire US military. It is the most important strategic command center in the US outside the Pentagon.Right outside Colorado springs lol
Plus those disclaimers are being brigaded left and right lately. Then counter brigaded to have them taken down The "pink blood" X thread comes to mind
&gt;Saudi Arabia doesn‚Äôt have the support of virtually the entire western worldNo but they have their effective silence. That said, point taken.
Sorry, what's so special about Colorado springs?
That shit is moving way to fast for LA traffic.
So they have its disinterested passivity instead. That's not a world of difference on outcome.Speculation and all that, but in an alternate universe where there was a Houthi uprising in Jedda or something, the "western world" wouldn't be nearly as up in arms.
In my *opinion,* if Israel wanted to genocide the Palestinians, they would/could have done so long ago. I'm not convinced.
The common Aljazeera video is to hamas but its old very old and was targeting something else and not like the real bombing video also this is true in a westerner hospital but not true in Palestine when we talk about hospitals there they isnt up to the medical standards is the western one they lack some much stuff they lacked alot before the siege and they lack even more after the siege and also most of the things they have always on deamnd bc how much civilians is getting killed or injured in last two weeks they do surgerys without medical anesthetic they dont have big oxygen tanks like u described and they understaffed and overwhelmed and im sure the supply of oxygen nitrogen and any other used medicines are in shortages bc of the siege that has been done to gaza not a singal truck entered gaza with anything and i mean anything no food medicine or anyother thing thats why its a war crime and people calling it And also its all over media now just search for the truth
Set in stone as you are going to be one of those skeletons outside the vault?
Decent movie, too.
Fake news, it was a Hamas launched rocket that failed. Stop spreading misinformation to fit your narrative. Rest in peace to every innocent person involved.
Love how the title of the post is *fucking conclusive,* yet the flair says "Unconfirmed."FFS people, **none of us little redditors know what actually happened**, we're just letting our biases take shape as sentiments.
Stone is good! Stone will survive! I'm glad to hear you're hopeful ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Has there been any evidence posted or coherent analysis that shows that Israel fired the missile that damaged that hospital?
It was very likely a Khaibar-1, a Syrian or Iranian-made missile that the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (a different but Hamas-allied and Iran-funded group) was intending to launch at Haifa since that is a further target.It has a 150 kg explosive payload and a 100 km range so it would have been a much larger explosion than the shitty Qassam homemade rockets that Hamas usually uses.
True this is hamas missiles so weak that if u fucus u could see iron dome air defence system destroy it in the air also dont u think its very weird how fast the exploitation happen ? I mean if your brain could handle such questions god forbid u overload your brain to think and look for the truth or maybe digging your head in sand is easier to u who knows anyway this is pointless this is the last time i reply to u because Israel have committed war crimes they have killed alot of civilians they have killed around 1000 childern or more they have used phosphorus on civilian targets and its all over media and people caught them changing their statements they said they did it first but then they say its hamas western media confirms it its in the headlines alos there was a more clearer video to show the bombing but clearly u dont to see it or use it but how knows maybe the 20 iq random guy on reddit is smarter than the whole world
Geoconfirmed? Ok that settles it. What are you talking about?
Saudi Arabia doesn‚Äôt have the support of virtually the entire western world when they Indiscriminately bomb and kill thousands of innocent kids and other civilians in a matter of a few days as collective punishment
Ukraine never went into Russia to execute civilians. I'm not defending Israel's response. Agree the comparison isn't great.
Abolsih religion world wide. Embrace science.
Hey I care about the truth, but the fact is I have zero ability to tell whether a rocket is from one side or another.
That's different... these are jews yo/s
But God will fix this... fml wake up!
Most of the video supports the claim that it was a gaza-launched rocket with a failed engine, or possibly some sort of intercept or mid-air collision.I find that normally this kind of story sort of percolates for several hours after the initial video as more video comes in.  It usually takes the media about 12-24 hours to pick up the story once it finds sources.I think this one was picked up in about 3 hours both because of the significance of the claim (300, 400, 500 or 800 dead from anything but a massive coordinated strike would be not just devastating, but historical) and because the Gaza Health ministry offered itself as a source.To come up with this amount of doctored video in the 5-10 hour mark seems unlikely without significant AI resources.
Not if you let them tell civilians to leave first, and the hospital is really a front for storing terrorists/ munitions. Also not sure what tf is wrong with this thread, but I've seen a lot of astroturfing by bots, check some of the accounts. Last I checked, Israel never weaponized rape, or kidnapped and executed busloads of women and children like Hamas. Why are you guys supporting terrorists?!?
I‚Äôd be like ‚ÄúHold on. Lemme make sure we‚Äôre talking about the same person‚Ä¶‚Äù [flash this video] ‚ÄúIs this your baby?‚Äù
Why is OP posting this with the title when it hasn't been confirmed who bombed the hospital?
Yes indeed. Targeting a hospital is against it as is having armed forces operating out of a hospital. It's old news. Hamas fires rockets from civilian buildings, Israel sends a warning shot and then blows up said building. It's fucked all around.
It‚Äôs called terrorism if they‚Äôre specifically targeting civilians for political motivation, which afaik Ukraine isn‚Äôt
Maaan guess that makes me gay. Unlucky
A hospital basically is a bomb. Shit load of oxygen and nitrogen tanks, usually giant ones outside. I can see how one can explode like that. My hospital has 3 giant tanks. If it explodes, it‚Äôs gonna be big. The video I saw was the one on Aljazeera.
Not a woman in sight
Which resolutions?  I see that [a resolution recently failed because it didn't explicitly condemn Hamas](https://www.france24.com/en/live-news/20231017-un-security-council-rejects-russian-resolution-on-israel-hamas-war).  I also see that [in 2018](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-israel-palestinians-un-idUSKBN1O52NV) they didn't get the 2/3 votes to explicitly condemn Hamas, but they did get more yays than nays (87 votes in favor, 58 against, 32 abstentions, and 16 no-votes).Neither of these actively endorse Hamas as legitimate.
https://x.com/OrianShamriz/status/1714365814160175213?s=20Here‚Äôs footage from the misfire by the Palestinian Defense Force that resulted in the hospital explosionIsrael already publishing forensic evidence besides the obviousY‚Äôall should be ashamed of yourselvesPalestinians literally bombed themselves and blamed the Jews, which global media scooped and ran with INSTANTLY
Morality? Only the weak hide behind such excuses. They know the money will never reach its intended destination and will probably be taken over by Hamas or Hezbolla but still people pay coz they don't want to come across as "immoral", or racist. Arab nations are super rich. Yet they have taken zero Gazans in their country and given no help to them either. But sure, collect money from regular people coz its "moral". Lol. Remember the UAE minister saying the west allows these organizations to exist under the garb of charities while they cant operate in Muslim nations. You can continue playing whoz got more morals.
Israel has killed way more Palestinians AND has been kicking Palestinians out of there homes so jews can live there.
The hospital wasn‚Äôt leveled, footage of the impact site seems to be from the parking lot next to it (where civilians were probably staying due to the perceived safety of being near a hospital). Hospital itself seems to be in decent condition. I‚Äôm also putting a grain of salt on ‚Äúhundreds‚Äù until an actuall non biased count is done.
We also sent warships over to the gulf to prevent any neighboring countries from intervening to stop Israel‚Äôs ethnic cleansing campaign.
Fwiw their iron dome we contributed to saved a lot of lives. We also give Palestinians $600 million a year and they seem to have plenty of money to buy rockets and build tunnels, so do the math on that I guess
geoconfirmed is not a legitimate  source for information. It's some random twitter account.
Good band also
Missing tiki torches LOLOLLLLLLLL
Tyson, yes.  And its annoying because he is so obvious about it, so lumbering in the way he gets to the "answer".  Rogan, yes and no. He's ignorant about a lot of things. And he's not feigning ignorance so much as feigning stupidity. Even when he gets a true and correct answer, he will forget it by next podcast. Over and over, he is "skeptical" about the same things.
It wasn't caught on Al Jazeera (give me a link and show me where?).and GeoConfirmed is a NOT a legitimate source (some random twitter).Also, the IDF is also not a legitimate source since they are a party to the war.
I feel sorry for those of you you don't live near a valuable nuclear target and have to play IRL fallout when this all goes south.I live in Colorado springs. My guess is there's no less than two dozen nukes from multiple nations aimed right at us. My Armageddon plans are pretty set in stone.
This sub is crawling with Hamas defenders
Narrative echo chambers supersede fact, truth or logic. People have extreme polar views on the entire situation and don't want to see news that is negative to their own viewpoint.
Cool story, bro.
Poland. Refugees are  from Ukraine. Almost 3,5 million of it.
So i totally get that , and as a  British i do understand the pain that the usa went through in 911.But the usa made her fair share for the Muslims too ,the crimes that they did to the muslims is worse and left more victims than the 911.And to mistrust all muslims because the acts of some is just stupid.How do you feel if people judge and mistrust you by the Klan acts as an American?Would you mistrust all the Americans after all the school's shootings that you had ?Probably notWe are humans who are capable to think , we shouldn't make excuses for our wrong thoughts , and what you called personal insights.
They are kinda like Trump supporters. They don't care if they are wrong; they'll just keep doing it anyway.
No Moslim brothers this time?  Why Arab countries don't want Palestinians?
Read what they wrote and what they cite, then decide for yourself if it's sound.  Don't wait around for a publication to spoon-feed you their version.
More like B
Doesn't make sense to me how 1 piece of a shitty Hamas missile would level a whole hospital killing hundreds

And this kind of confusion amid terror is what could escalate this into a worldwide conflict.
Dude u sound silly it‚Äôs their own land why should they have to leave it because somebody has better weapons and it is true been pushing them out little by little shit is disgusting
This Hamas tool just won't give up.
Source? No news source has discussed this and the latest video looks like the rocket was a failed shoot down
I feel better now.
That is a lot of pissed off people
 I only added what Palestinians did to my personal insight as it was against me or my country. I was trying to give an American perspective as an example of how we may use fear or ignorance as a factor. The 911 event was a pivotal influence in American history which has caused mistrust in Muslims amongst Americans.
For fucks sale people, wait with your conclusions until things are verified!
And most likely it was just a fuck up. Welcome to war.
Friend, I know you're worried right now. But it's gonna get a lot worse.
Exactly. The title of the post makes it seem like a definite fact. IDF refutes this report and until an outside agency weighs in people should be careful. But f me it‚Äôs Reddit what should I expect.
Yeah I mean, it definitely looks like this is on Hamas.
How are you getting downvoted for this??
Lol you can‚Äôt be serious
https://twitter.com/jconricus/status/1714479993051337201?t=_IvxysA4_mgMeznQLjMD1A&amp;s=19
I can't believe you can watch this video and truly believe that these IDF men are not capable of rape and murder. I 100% believe that these men are absolutely capable of rape and murder. If they can torment a disabled man like this in public, they are absolutely able to rape and kill someone when there's no camera on them.

They should blame Hamas for everything. Don‚Äôt start a war, fight, or battle you can‚Äôt win. Maybe the Palestinians should do to Hamas what Hamas did to the people at the festival or the people in settlements.
You wrote patients wrong.
The world is going to hell in a handbasket
This post is spreading misinformation. Israel did not threaten to bomb this hospital.Edit: Downvotes for pointing out the hypocrisy of spreading misinformation. Not surprising. Let the misinformation flow, I guess, as long as it supports your pre-existing bias.
Wow, and you know they‚Äôll use the excuse that they can‚Äôt be sure they aren‚Äôt HAMAS when they deny them entry back.
This video was on live and wasn't at the time of the bombing of the hospital ! Check the time on the video, it's shown at the bottom right...
Do you want to start a stampede and/or a crush of people? Because this is how you start a stampede and/or a crush of people.
Yeah the way I look at it, if I'm not in the middle of it and forced to take a side, then I shouldn't. Both sides commit atrocities and it's far beyond who started it. I hope for peace, but that's obviously just a word and a dream there is never peace just quieter wars. Everyone is manipulated by religious and/or  political propaganda and the truth is buried in a pile of bodies.

Why is it all men in the room?
All Israel has to do is say they believe Hamas has tunnels under the hospital. Then they can blow it up.
Hamas is not doing that. Wake up and smell the damn roses. Isreal is far beyond cruel.   [https://www.tiktok.com/@8.almr/video/7288498062287293728?\_r=1&amp;\_t=8gXmFOIutbk](https://www.tiktok.com/@8.almr/video/7288498062287293728?_r=1&amp;_t=8gXmFOIutbk)

Such a good book
Israel only cares about war crimes and genocide if it‚Äôs World War Two.
I've never seen a literal Simpson's movie mob before.
Never once is bombing civilians okay in any shape of form I don‚Äôt care who‚Äôs bombing who.
Literal sea of people.
Hamas blew up their own hospital.
The beheaded theory of 40 babies was debunked as false information. Theres also an interview of an Israeli woman herself who escaped the Nova concert massacre and captured by Hamas saying that they treated her with respect and civilians were killed by IDF themselves in the crossfire
Seems nothing. That‚Äôs an American JDAM. Not the one in the video that is destroyed. The one that hit the hospital. There are better videos than the one you posted from Israel‚Äôs propaganda.
Does Palestine have a right to exist too?
I think "torn" is probably the healthiest take on the whole thing. It's pointless, but it's life and death. It's meaningless, yet it will end all meaning for so many.
You‚Äôre all a bunch of pawns in a propaganda war. Get your news from reputable news sources instead of fueling your hate boners on random shit on Reddit because it makes you feel special to be offended.
Looking into the book because I'm a big reader (when the girls allow me ha.) Topic of choice being true crime, I felt like when I kept getting the "someone's watching me" feeling that it was related to me creeping myself out! Haha

Israel did not bomb a hospital. It‚Äôs a failed rocket launch, stop believing the lies
Because it makes less noise, I'm assuming.
It was but that goes against the Reddit agenda
OP, if you're comfortable with it, PLEASE buy a gun.  There's no telling what this twisted fuck will do.
Dude same, was like ‚Äúso what I see this daily‚Äù lol
I am curious where OP is at. Here in Minnesota I don‚Äôt know a house without a gun. Growing up I had a neighbor shoot a home intruder less then a mile over. I just can‚Äôt imagine people thinking they wouldn‚Äôt get killed for this.
You are mischaracterizing the disclaimer. He geolocated the launch of the rocket as coming from Gaza, as well as the strike being the Hospital. Here is the exact quote."Important note:Our conclusions are based on our geolocations:That doesn't mean that they are THE truth, just what we think is highly likely based on our geolocations(facts) and logic/reason.We are geolocators, not official investigators.Do not take this conclusion as proven fact!To be sure what really happened different official investigations are needed."

No they haven't
I've heard about "peeping toms" all my life, and always considered the concept creepy... However, seeing one in the act is next level disturbing.
https://genevasolutions.news/peace-humanitarian/ukraine-is-targeting-hospitals-always-a-war-crimeCircumstances aren't the same, but this explains when it is or isn't a war crime.
Ukraine is a bad example because they are attacking military targets. I am not an Israel supporter but aHamas attacking civilians doesn't win you any fans. I understand why they do it but still.
Agreed its Hamas and Islamic Jihad
Hamas rocket payloads don‚Äôt do enough damage to level a hospital
Yes, a piece of a rocket made out of water pipes caused a hospital to collapseAre you out of your mind?
https://x.com/oalexanderdk/status/1714376384464736653?s=46&amp;t=5cDzFBmJidEH4qu2xcZCgQIncorrect. OSINT is confirming through the Al Jazeera livestream of Gaza. You can see the rocket pretty clearly.
Yeah but what‚Äôs the difference? Israel has been breaking all kinds of Geneva conventions for years.  Why hold them accountable now? (&lt;‚Äî rage and sarcasm)
&gt; Blah blah  this is tragic, But this is what Hamas and Islamic Jihad do, they kill civilians. [https://twitter.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390254935851272?s=20](https://twitter.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390254935851272?s=20)
I guess you just bomb them anyway or something. What I like about this argument is that it assumes Israel has never used human shields
Yeah, sounds like a good reason to go underneath to kill them, rather than blow up the  whole block and hope you got them.
Heartbreaking! Why did his father and son die, because according to many they deserved to die because they lived in a country that had some terrorists and hence it is assumed that they all are terrorists. Sometimes I think that I am either really smart and can understand that this is wrong or the opposite.   How did the Holocaust happen? Exactly as it is happening now.
Hamas misfire. They killed their own people.
There is video proof the is a rocket from hamas that blew up at the hospital https://x.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390274900734049?s=20
at first glance we thought it was an israeli airstrike. turns out its a Hamas rocket malfunctioning. civilians are the only losers
Hamas hides underneath the Palestinian people
Apparently Hamas uses hospitals as human shields. Not taking a side just stating a fact. War is so insane.Why the downvotes? Seriously
Not as bad as you attempt to put Jew dick in your own mouth. You're such a shill it's disgusting. This is on a video of dead Palestinian children. The IDF themselves said that they hit this hospital. Idk how you're even trying to defend them.
Of course people are so quick to accuse Israel and ignore/gaslight Hamas as the innocent victim.
The misinformation spread at record speed with this one.
Its very easy to see that my statement clearly said hamas are animals and barbarians. You are very obviously an amateur at basic communication so you attempt to put words in my mouth. Nice try though.
Fuck these nazis
Yes but the israelis and their lobbyists have bought lots of politicians in the US so they're allowed to murder, bomb and commit other war crimes.
And you call Palestinians animals. Good, now we all know you just got Jew cock in your throat. And fyi, the Israelis storm Gaza and the West Bank constantly. Theyre constantly attacking Palestine. Every day for the past 48 years. So try again.
Realistically, what country would be willing to accept 2 million refugees on short notice
Not the same thing at all. There is no easy parallel here.
I have no problem condemning crimes and evil done by either side.  What I have a problem with is people justifying Hamas straight up murdering civilians with statements like‚ÄúWell Israel did bad stuff too so it‚Äôs ok‚Äù
A lot of home invasion rapists start out as peepers.
This was a faulty Hamas rocket even their own fucking news station confirmed it
I said this above. Israel did not storm the border and specifically rape and murder women, children and the elderly. The response gaza is receiving is because of the barbarianism that hamas proudly displayed. The civilian deaths you are now referring to are because of the war hamas has brought on gaza. It is not "a couple of jews murdered" they were raped, dragged through the streets, spat on, beheaded, mutilated by hand. The response was not "too bomb civilians" as you so ignorantly put it, it is to eradicate hamas who happen to have a stranglehold in gaza, where civilians live. You are trying to justify the behaviour of animals, while calling me an idiot. The irony.
#israelnotrealcountry
Ban all religions. All this violence over false idols.
In b4 lock down
hypocrite, you don't care about the children being burned alive in schools and hospital bombings. I bet you think the guy in the video is part of Hamas and deserves it üôÑ
Lmfao their literally at war with Gaza stupid
How the hell do you figure that. This is the MOST aggressive IDF has been. After what? A FUCKING HAMAS ATTCK ON CIVILIANS!!!  So how about this, if Hamas peaceful took prisoners for exchange, which is what you‚Äôre suggesting and supporting, why haven‚Äôt they been exchanged. Where‚Äôs the 290 PEACUFUL FESTIVAL GOERS??? If you can show me when Hamas didn‚Äôt preform those kind of actions then you might be getting somewhere.  But last time I checked, no matter the amount of aggression by IDF they did not massacre 12 settlements and a music festival over the first 24 hours in the name of kindness and peace.
Whole lotta people on both sides have extremely strong views they'll amplify any way possible. That doubles for the actual combatants in this conflict. Best to just wait for third party media from reputable sources to report on the context and what's actually happening with these images and videos being released. What's disgusting is the media personalities who stand to monetarily gain from boosting their bias on the conflict then will not give 2 shits if they end up being wrong.
Nah anyone who actually thinks it was their own rocket is completely brainwashed, their rockets don‚Äôt even fire in that direction from behind Gaza so it‚Äôs literally impossible
40 babies is a lie and that's confirmed and ididnt say hams is good ad but 1000 child and people justifying it how !!!
Israel confirmed that Israel are not responsible for the attack...
Anyone who actually thinks hamas ‚Äúbomb‚Äù their own hospital is completely brainwashed.There is virtually no possibility that their own missiles hit their own hospital, their missiles are not even stationed anywhere near behind that hospital building and the footage clearly shows the rocket coming from the southern side of Gaza. Sad how people would even stop to think to believe Israel was not the one who fired it.
I can't believe this is a real comment. Because of this, the rape, murder, and decapitation of women and children is justified? You are truly a stupid and despicable person.
No, I'm sure that happened a couple times. But it didn't happen 1,500 times like it did to the Palestinians. A couple Jews died and the response was to drop 4000 tons of bombs on civilians. And the Jews are bragging about how much death they're causing. You're the idiot.
The only source for this interpretation is IDF. It could very well be disinformation, as it came out pretty quickly after the event, as such analysis usually takes some time. Others are claiming the source of the missile was Israel. I don't know and we may not know for a while.
Sorry? Proof of dead Israeli civilians? Are you stupid or blind? Are you denying they killed and raped civilians when they stormed the border?
Sure is. Better root for IDF.JI, not Hamas or IDF, launched a rocket barrage and one fell on the hospital.https://x.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390274900734049?s=20
LieJI, not Hamas or IDF, launched a rocket barrage and one fell on the hospital.https://x.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390274900734049?s=20
What a jerk off
LieJI, not Hamas or IDF, launched a rocket barrage and one fell on the hospital.https://x.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390274900734049?s=20
Israel literally targeted the same hospital on Oct 14th before it was bombed yesterday. The digital spokesperson posted that Israel bombed the hospital and then deleted the tweet after the story got backlash. Israel has bombed hospitals MULTIPLE times before. But now they didn‚Äôt do this?? Please be serious.
Hamas used Chinese water pipes before. They literally just need a metal tube.
It is funny saying "if you aren't able to condemn the oct 7th murder spree"  when many aren't able to codemn the decades of mistreatment and the horrible crimes that isreal did to Palestine.
Quoting the estimable Joker ‚Äú‚Ä¶..and here we go again !‚Äù
Exploded mid-air and yet it wasn't picked up on camera in the original video? A midair explosion didn't even catch the cameraman's attention.[https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1714406243652272340](https://twitter.com/washingtonpost/status/1714406243652272340)And furthermore, how could the rocket explode twice? Once in the air and once on the ground?
People who don‚Äôt say anything are the worst god knows what he would‚Äôve done if u didn‚Äôt have a camera I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you and you‚Äôre kids
Lol really wanna bring up children lmfao what about the 250 innocent people at the festival which started this, what about the families that were just at home that were killed for no reason, Gaza wouldn‚Äôt even be there if it wasn‚Äôt for Israel, what about the babies that were in those homes and no I‚Äôm not talking about the 40 beheaded babies I‚Äôm talking about the ones that were in their crates that were found dead?
I did
LOL. Just like they were going to release proof of dead babies, and it was all fake. Just like they were going to release proof of dead Israeli civilians and it was all fake. Don't hold your breath buddy. Tell you what, if they release proof, and it turns out to be real, I'll send you 20 trillion dollars.
Please learn more about the history of this situation.
Nothing to justify killing of civilians more than 1000 child died since the start of war in gaza
So is it okay to accept the isreal actions because it 's been for the benefit of their people?Man what  isreal doing now is genocide you shouldn't make any excuses for them or even accept those actions .Not only the west Bank event .You saw what they did yesterday??You said that they had to know what this recent actions would cost.Why wouldn't you say even isreal had to know what years of mistreatment to the Palestinians will cost them ?Should they just keep doing whatever they want without any consequences ?
‚ÄúWE DID IT!!!‚Äù‚Äî Reddit
Well we do give them 3 BILLION a year
Ah, I see. The Hamas media machine is in full swing. Full of shit too.
Fatah sayed its was isreal even though its an anemy of hamas
Guy go watch more than one fucking video. Palestinians are even saying it was Hamas rockets . I‚Äôm done here. Stop crying , do more research than reading a headline and looking at one video
So many contradicting claims.Some sites saying its misfired/broken rocket from Hamas, while another source claimed that its IDF... which is which?
No they should go kill Hamas... not blow up civilian buildings.
Sure sure üòâ
Womp womp stay mad
Hamas is also known for hiding arms stashed in hospitals and schools and residential building and from the videos that have been shown it was a tight space which gives reason for bigger explosion due to pressure
It was in the hospital square
Stop believing everything you use your brain üß†
The video evidence seems to suggest this was Hamas will a failed rocket launch.
The video they show the rocket exploded in sky  how come when it land to do big explosion again
The video is they show is one hour older than the time the rocket its has time stamp on it from the tv channel
ok so I'm going to get blasted but hasn't it always been that way? Like, it's a Stalemate as far as what is or who is responsible for this mess. No one knows which side should do what, or I guess what I am trying to convey is that it's basically a never ending Stalemate on a horrible situation. You can say that one side is the asshole, or that both sides are equally assholes, but that doesn't change the fact as what is going to happen? Currently from the way things are looking, war. What's the alternative other than picking sides from that perspective? Trying to remain neutral in a war can historically be a massive mistake.
They had ammo and other rockets stored at the hospital. Plus oxygen tanks and so forth. Dude it wasn‚Äôt Israel .
I was ignorant to this whole Gaza Israeli situation but fuck me the Israelis do some horrible horrible shit.
There‚Äôs thermal imaging of the rocket being launched by hamas lol it failed mid air investigations already been done
But Hamas does represent Palestinians, at least the ones in the Gaza Strip. My biggest problem with Hamas is they don‚Äôt care about their people, at least with their actions. They destroyed infrastructure to make weapons, and plan to kill civilians. They had to know what this recent actions would cost. However Israel actions have mostly been for the benefit of their people. Even though it has come at the expense of the Palestinians in the West Bank.
Karen would like to speak to the manager.
It was hamas that dropped it there‚Äôs thermal imaging of the rocket that was launched by hamas that landed on the hospital
Receipts tell a different story. IDF did that. Your PR failed. You won't get paid. Sorry.
It was fucking big explosion how w rocket explode twice  ?????
Lmaooo dam that‚Äôs true. That def would‚Äôve worked
Have seeing a strike area first hand in Afghanistan I can tell you these bodies were moved here. Most likely those killed in strikes by IDF and for effect moved there to create a narrative. While everyone is screaming about civilians being killed no one understands the effects of a war unless you have been in one. The real difference is IDF doesn‚Äôt purposely target civilians but also doesn‚Äôt hold back from hitting a target and Hamas targets civilians with intent to kill them. What is currently happening is Hamas is firing off rockets at Israel. This known as a POO site to the IDF, this stands for Point Of Origin. Maybe in a court yard, maybe on a roof, mainly Hamas wants it in a populated area so they have some social media propaganda. The counter battery radar calculates the point of origin. They either fire artillery or after several strikes from a POO site they just level the entire building. This rate here is pretty much what‚Äôs going on. Hamas loves IDF accidentally killing civilians it just makes their cause stronger that Israel is bad and Hamas is good. War is dirty and nasty, there will be casualties from civilians especially in a war with an insurgency and that‚Äôs exactly what this is. In Gaza Hamas is the home team and people will support the home team regardless of the wrong they know they‚Äôre doing. They won‚Äôt do anything about it and will suffer for it. Every family member killed will create resentment regardless of who‚Äôs at fault to ‚Äúthe invaders‚Äù.Edit: I ment to post that as a general comment and got attached to yours. SorryEdit2: Ok so this was next to impact site so that‚Äôs why grass is green and such. Yes those bodies were moved there. This was a rocket that malfunctioned or was shot down from early reports from Hamas and landed on the hospital. There is intercepted traffic over radio that the conversation takes place. There is also video out now that shows the moment the rockets explodes in the air and it splashing down on the location of the hospital.
Many hospitals, many schools.
A missile that has blown can not do it again
No one on this Reddit seems interested in facts.  They all scramble to pick sides and even when facts come out in a situation they were spreading misinformation about, they go strangely silent.  People always think the great human war crimes of the past like the Holocaust, Cambodia and etc.  could never happen again in this modern age, but I honestly think it could just happen faster now, thanks to technology being able to spread propaganda and misinformation faster as people scramble to choose sides.It‚Äôs depressing.
 saying rocket bombed in the sky then did all of this how its that possible
Then call out OP for making assumptions in the comments. All the evidence points to Hamas lolz
Dude that's an hour old video go watch the original it has time stamp
Yeah this was a Hamas missile ! Stop with the fake news. There‚Äôs even video of the missile being launched by Hamas then hitting hospital.
Got proof that Israel did it?
I already didüôèüèª
I hope you and your family are safe and never harbor terrorist. ( deleted your commenting hoping my family dies‚Ä¶ ü§°)
Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) They're both originally offshoots of the Muslim Brotherhood, formed in the early 80s, founders were exiled to Lebanon by the 90s, and was originally trained/equipped/funded by Iran through Hezbollah.
geoguesser‚Äôs source in that twitter thread debunked it being a hamas rocket though?
It‚Äôs infuriating isn‚Äôt it?!?!? Obviously no one wants to hear the truth because it would mess up the narrative of the protesters.
What should Israel do then?  Give Hamas a free pass after massacring 1400 civilians?  Say it‚Äôs okay to kidnap 199 hostages?  Gaza has massive weapons reserves underground‚Äîif Israel does nothing then 10:07 happens again.
Egypt and Jordan are not accepting refugees, there is only one thing to do is for Israel and Palestine to fix their problems, per say king of Jordan https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/king-abdullah-gaza-no-refugees-jordan-no-refugees-egypt-2023-10-17/
It was caught on Al Jazeera‚Äôs live stream and geoconfirmed by that twitter account of the same name. Also the IDF apparently confirmed it with footage, im not sure if it was the same footage or not. But yea, all the evidence points to Hamas. By now there is probably more mounting evidence.
It's also not an Israel is bad, Palestine is innocent situation. Hamas is bad, the Palestinian people suffer at least in part because of them. We need humanitarian solutions, not political ones, if we are going to help any civilians on either side.
disputed how? there's video of it now
In this case, it isn't that the evidence isn't valid. It's that the crime itself requires him to expose himself ***to*** someone. Merely exposing himself in her yard doesn't count.As a stupid comparison: It's legal to swing my fist if nobody is around, but it's not legal to punch you.Edit: Here's the law in my state:&gt;  A person commits indecent exposure if he or she exposes his or her genitals or anus or she exposes the areola or nipple of her breast or breasts **and another person is present**, and the defendant is reckless about whether the other person, as a reasonable person, would be offended or alarmed by the act.https://www.azleg.gov/ars/13/01402.htm
All this for an invisible man in the sky and some dirt on the ground. Humans being fools.
L‚ÄôOtters are NOT afraid.
If the piece was the payload, of course.  I encourage everybody to read through the thread, there's some interesting discussion.  The explosion at the hospital coincided too clearly with a large barrage fired from within Northern Gaza in that area to be coincidental, but the specifics of the projectile are being explored (e.g. was it motor failure, was it intercepted, etc.)
Not saying you are wrong but who confirmed it?
&gt; They were told to evacuate because of the ground offensiveTo go where? to Disneyland? It is too far away
That's why Israel destroyed the Rafah crossing on the Egyptian side. They're trying to force the crowds onto Sinai.
You're telling that a piece of a missile that exploded mid air, went straight into a hospital that was targeted by Israel hours before (all by chance). Wow, what are the odds.
Why this isn't higher is beyond me. There are multiple videos showing a rocket breaking up over the hospital. And the boom. Really come on how hard is it to look that up.
They bombed a Christian hospital earlier today and were like "uhhh, pretty sure that was Hamas fucking up and missing with a rocket they sent at us."For real, entire thing is absolutely fucked.
People don't care about the truth. They have already chosen their sides, the same thing happened with the baby d*capitated story. They'll somehow do the mental gymnastics and say that Al-Jazeera is pro-israel now.
The whole thing is absolutely barbaric, common sense is out the window....
Yup.  And every time the facts come out later they suddenly go quiet on the matter.  On to the next thing we can blame ‚Äòthe other side‚Äô for!
Got proof that Israel did it?
Quick!  Give them 10M USD!
Is this subreddit modded by Hamas FrEeDoM FiGhtErS?
They put a disclaimer in the thread you just linked to that this is not proof that the hospital bombing was caused by a rocket from Gaza. Your source is not even making the claim that you are making.
Yes humans natural tend to accept more what is similar to their believes blindly sadly.And for the 911, it is true that some of them did celebrate but there is really big part of the Palestinians saying that innocent people didn't deserve that.But it is the same thing as Israelis going out saying death to all muslims we will kill you all ?And when some jew went out making fun of Mohamed the Muslims prophet and saying thay they deserve death?Do you remember when some video show isreal's soldiers saying that they will kill Palestinians kids over and over again ?Why only adding what the Palestinians did wrong to your personal insight?The action of some people doesn't represent all of them , you should put this in consideration.But truth be told you are right in the last part , i too want to see 2 states . With both parties respecting each other . But it is far from reality.I just want people to stop the hypocrisy and treat both sides equally.
Israel claimed each and every bomb they sent to Gaza whether or not they had terrorists in there and yet this one they didn't. Why not? They have the green light from the west to bomb the crap out of gaza yet they're saying this one wasn't them.
Egypt said No Sinai available for you!
Murdered by a failed Hamas rocket, just like they bombed the people evacuating in the other video. #FreeGazaFromHamas
catch 22 duh
I think Sunday I was with a friend asking me about this whole thing and all I could say was ‚Äúthis is the most propagandized event of our lifetimes happening, if you feel strongly for either side, you‚Äôre fucking up philosophically‚ÄùI just don‚Äôt get it and the very strong opinions
Great rebuttal. You have nothing so you just revert to 12 year old insults. Israel is to release proof it was an Islamic jihad missile. You will be proven the dumbass when the recordings and aerial footage is released.
Saw a report that says that it might even be a secondary islamic jihadist group, not even Hamas, but possibly affiliated idk. All over the place. What a fuckin mess, welcome to the information age.
Nothing has been confirmed.
And it was Hamas because they use shitty rokets. Sad
Yes yes, God will avenge you, and then God will avenge them and then this shit will never end until one of you is wiped off the face of the earth.
I say much more likely that it is Hamas. Israel has certainly been committing atrocities in the recent past. But they have nothing to gain by bombing a hospital, and Hamas has everything to gain by portraying Israel to be an inhumane monster, willing to bomb hospitals and fleeing children.
Source: some guy on twitter
No evidence of Israeli airstrike. The likelihood of a Palestinian rocket landing on the hospital goes up with every hour. However, any confirmatory reports of which there were multiplr, show Hamas is to blame.
I know its allah akbar you ignorant in what context are you saying do even what its used for ???
you're saying a piece of a rocket caused an explosion of that magnitude?
Me too
Bro your either a bot or brainwashed by terrorist
I know but why are saying it are you being sarcastic of the religion i don't get it !!
Well‚Ä¶ not launched ‚Äúat‚Äù. It was unintended. No one on either side was aiming at the hospital.
Now deleted, wonder why https://preview.redd.it/nryied3u0vub1.jpeg?width=496&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=654066304ef1fb33e34c00bc283da49e2291a55d
Allah Akbar! R u stupid or just uneducated?
Alleged.
No, it hasn't been confirmed.
No, hamas is ALWAYS bad. Palestine not necessarily
Makes sense if we actually knew for certain who bombed the hospital.
Wait what? The state of Israel has commited war crimes for 75 years, not just Netanyahu.
What does this mean ?
In fact alot of jews who lived in Palestine in the past converted to islam and now they are Palestinians how earth being from certain religion gives you the right to occupy a country and killed its people an ld take their homes
Somebody cave this man‚Äôs skull in already Jesus
International outrage? Israel and the west has mostly resigned to the idea of committing genocide against the Palestinian people. Maybe they‚Äôll talk about this in 50 years, but what hamas has done over the last couple weeks has signed Gaza‚Äôs death warrant. This won‚Äôt make the front page news in the US for more than a day‚Äîif that. Those who haven‚Äôt embraced apathy are either outliers or those who just want to see Hamas destroyed at any cost.
There were. But the Jews today aren't the same Jews thousand years ago.There were some genetic studies for the indigenous Palestinian Jews (Jews that didn't leave for Europe, and instead remained in the region) and the findings were that the Palestinian Jews had more genetic similarities with the other Palestinians (Muslim and Arabs) than with Jews from Europe, Americas, Asia. This is because the Diaspora Jews mixed with other people, some converted etc. They are not the same people anymore.And if you claim that people deserve to be there because of their holy texts, then all have claim. Let's not forget that Christianism is an offspring of Judaism and Islam is an offspring of Christianism. Many Jews that remained in Palestine mixed with Arabs and converted to either Islam or Christianism, while a few remained as Jews.In conclusion, migrant (Zionist) Jews are actually killing their own ancestral peoples.
Really cause look at this video of a rocket barrage flying right over where a massive explosion just happens to be right below it. Weird [https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/RuTObCVghJ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/RuTObCVghJ)
Even if jews lived Palestine 2000 thousand years ago that doesn't give them the right to take people houses and land in the present
What we think of as the modern nation state of Israel was founded in 1948. Before that Jews, Christians and Muslims lived together in Palestine. The modern state of Israel was formed when Zionists began ethnically cleansing non-Jewish people from their communities, replacing them with Jewish immigrants and imposing a Jewish-supremest system instead of the pluralistic society that existed before.
Finally we‚Äôre able to speak about this shit. I‚Äôve felt like I was the only one for some time
Jews lived in Moroccan , yeemen , egypt , iraq and peacefully while jews in Europe was being killed
Exactly mate , a lot of information were proven to be  fabricated and wrong.Still i am not defending hamas , but the isreal government is so desperate that keep posting false informations.
Islam is about love all this terrorist organization is just using islam for political reasons by brainwashing teenagers to fight for them
It‚Äôs not currently known fact who bombed the hospital. Stop spreading misinfo.
Da fuq we do?
All evidence point to Hamas launching rockets at the hospital. It‚Äôs actually been confirmed for an hour or 2
More detonated bombs means more money for Boeing, Raytheon, and Lockheed &amp; Matin. More money for the military industrial complex means more campaign funds for Democrats and Republicans. More campaign funds for Democrats and Republicans means nothing to anyone else. The money just accumulates around weapon manufacturers and political parties.
Dude you are blinded by the media to think muslims can't live with jews in peace jews back in the was hated all over Europe so alot of them went to the middle east and muslims welcomed your are the one being racist when you say that all muslim are terrorist
Al Jazeera live stream shows Hamas‚Äô rockets hit the hospital
Been geoconfirmed that Hamas bombed the hospital
Akbar!!!!
Over in combat footage there seems to be consensus that its a failed rocket motor of a rocket fired from Gaza strip. This is based on al jeezera footage.
Its been confirmed that Hamas‚Äô rockets hit the hospital.What is your source claiming israel is responsible?
&gt;GeoConfirmed ISR-PAL.  &gt;  &gt;A missile launched by Palestinian Groups exploded mid-air and one of the pieces fell on the Al-Ahli Arab Hospital's yard.  &gt;  &gt;31.504822, 34.46169  &gt;  &gt;Before reacting READ our thread.[Source](https://twitter.com/geoconfirmed/status/1714390254935851272?s=46&amp;t=7BjfcNwqyYe-A4pF0YoTdA)
For real like Israel doesn‚Äôt deny it‚Äôs dropped jdams. There‚Äôs nothing proving that bomb hit the hospital I. The video. Also reporters on ground in Israel stated that they were under high alert and in bomb shelter because there was a missile barrage coming from Gaza at the same time. That‚Äôs some coincidenceEdit-to add link[https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/RuTObCVghJ](https://www.reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/RuTObCVghJ)
I feel bad for the human shields.
And all of this was supported by uk and usa with unlimited money create isreal
‚ÄûZionists could have lived peacefully in palestine‚Äú Do you really believe the shit you are talking? There is no peaceful living with radical islam and terrorist who kill every unbeliever who doesn‚Äôt believe what they believe in.And if we want to be precise. Jews have been in that land long before Islam even existed. And I don‚Äôt even wan‚Äòt to start talking about ‚ÄúPalestine‚Äú. These are facts and that‚Äôs coming from someone who is 1/4 palestinian.
There are no good sides in this conflict -
The general public is so blind
Not as evil how exactly? What hamas did this time no one can deny that is horrible . But to be fair too you saw how some fake new even came from the white house , than they denied it after wards, like for example beheading babies , and it was proven to be wrong.I am not defending hamas and there is no  way that i will do , but hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians.When the isreal government does represent isreal.What i don't get why over the years when isreal killed and kidnapped and committed some of the most horrible acts , no one talked or even cared .I didn't see anyone saying that isreal government is terrorists , i didn't see the us the uk France and people like them saying that they support Palestine and that they have the right to defend themselves.My Argument in the whole post not to defend Hamas , but to try to understand this hypocrisy that kept going for decades.And that maybe people will be capable to see that both civilians have the same rights and should be treated equally.And that both Hamas and the isreal government should be punished for their acts.
Its in not about hams isreal loves to make about hamas to show the world she is fighting against terrorism but this conflict started way back before hamas even existed , after the world war 2 when jews went to Palestine as refugees and the arabs welcomed them but in 1947 - 1948 Zionist militants stared to force arabs to leave their land and the Palestinians flee to gaza and the west bank after massacres from the  zionist militants in 1948 they established what we know today as isreal , the west bank and gaza remained Palestinian land but under occupation of isreal And today the idf controls the life of Palestinian people in the west bank as if they were animals completing alot of crimes you can search some them online , the Presence of hamas in gaza benefits the occupation to do crimes under the cover of fighting terrorism
Lmfaoi show you actual news article from several sources saying Hamas is in control of palastine and all you can is it‚Äôs misinformation with no sources what a joke. And yes there is a Palestinian government  in Gaza. But it‚Äôs under Hamas control. And yes Hamas call themselves freedom fighters so did isis so did Al qiuda. They are Islamic extremist that want sharia law spread across the world. That‚Äôs not freedom that‚Äôs oppression.Edited-for clarification, fixing misspeak.
Wouldn't be at all surprised if Hamas bombed it / an accident occurred with a Hamas explosive. Just an extension of the 'human shield' to win hearts and minds technique. They don't care about dead people, let alone Christians. If Muslims attended it, they're now martyrs in heaven.
I can see they have been mislead by propaganda.1. The bombing is not confirmed to be Israel.  Some report that it‚Äôs likely Hama‚Äôs own rockets.  I wouldn‚Äôt jump to any confusion until 3rd parties investigate.2.  The US doesn‚Äôt control Israel, despite whatever the Islamic media might claim.
We've been giving Israel money and weapons for decades.
Israel has declared war on hospitals. They mistook Hamas for hamaspitals.
I think most can agree that what Hamas did was a terrible atrocity and must be dealt with swiftly. But at the same time, Israel under Netanyahu has done next to nothing to deescalate tensions, and if anything they‚Äôve emboldened Hamas with continued attacks and illegal settlements in the West Bank. There‚Äôs a lot more to this than the headlines.
Fucking creep
Isn‚Äôt it now knowledge that it wasn‚Äôt Israel? Not taking sides or anything but I just hate false news being spread. Especially something of this magnitude
Nobody in this video would ever believe that their own jihad group accidentally hit the hospital with a rocket. There will never been a common understanding of realty by both sides. It‚Äôll never end
The folks at GeoConfirmed have no skin in the game. They‚Äôre quite good at this. Of course it‚Äôs disputed by ardent supporters of Hamas but that doesn‚Äôt make it untrue.
Except it might have been Hamas.
At first glance I thought this was LA traffic at night.
It honestly has been so difficult for me. I see so many pick sides so quickly and I am so torn.
And he's wanking while he's peeking.
That has been disputed. I am not picking sides. I am disgusted by the loss of human life on both sides.
Impressive! How many of them protested when Hamas slaughtered Jewish children?
It‚Äôs somehow our fault, again.
And they‚Äôre protesting the wrong people. Hamas/Islamic Jihad [has been confirmed](https://twitter.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390254935851272) to have launched a failed rocket from inside Gaza which caused the hospital explosion.
Disgusting pig
Exactly, the Internet left that were rabid over Israel's bombing of the hospital and calling for war crimes are all strangely silent when everyone learned it was a Hamas missile being housed near or in the hospital that destroyed it.
This is the correct take. So many people don‚Äôt see the nuance in this situation. It‚Äôs not just ‚ÄúIsrael good Hamas bad‚Äù
It doesn't say that. It says that their conclusion is that, and that they aren't sure if it's the truth
It was a [failed rocket launch](https://twitter.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390254935851272) from inside Gaza. Terrible that Islamic Jihad or Hamas did this and worse that they are blaming Israel for their barbaric actions.
I wonder  who they will be upset with once they find out it was not israel?
Listen to yourself. Yes, based on geo location data.
I mean these people are using words like ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù and ‚Äúethnic cleaning‚Äù for a country that  literally has voting citizens and government of that ethnicity‚Ä¶so unfortunately low expectations for intellectual honesty.
Goddamn sicko. Lock him up.
Time to reinforce it with the MEU.
And that tweet doesn‚Äôt confirm it to be factual. The account owner even said they‚Äôre not investigators and just going based on geo location data: https://x.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714411384476176741?s=20
Your wrong. Nazi Hamas has u fooled.
All of this is misleading
Reports are saying that it was failed Hamas rocket that struck the hospitalEdit: fuck all of you and your fake internet points.
Your brother and uncles should if give him an old fashion ass whooping. This kind of sicko is the one you eventually see arrested for rape and murder of some innocent female. Sick fuck
Ok argue with tell me why iam wrong
For real man go learn don't be that ignorant Palestine was part of ottoman empire
Super fucked up. They also bombed the shit out of a refugee camp in Gaza where people fled to a couple days ago. Monsters
Lol from do you read your history even Zionists says there was a Palestine and they occupied but they justify it now just denying it happened üòÇüòÇ
To Sinai to go live in a tent city. I'm not even kidding, that's what their officials are proposing. Go live in the desert, we'll clear Gaza, then we pinky promise to let you back like we promised millions of refugees we kicked out before you.
Was about to say..Glad you did!
I feel like this fellow would have gotten a curious case of lead poisoning where I live.. Sorry you had to deal with this disgusting waste of a human OP
Living in the west bank is hell cause the Israeli government controls every aspect of people life there You seem to be a grown and know politics watch documentaries about bank west  and what happens there ( we all know all the media is biased   To its side all we can do is read and  watch from both with open hearts to know the truth )
I love how there is video evidence of Isreals crime but little to no evidence of Palestinian crimes
People have already made up their mind. The truth whatever it may be will change nothing.
You‚Äôre a Douchebag inciting conflict for Reddit karma. Don‚Äôt bother reposting your audio clips or other bullshit sources. I‚Äôll just end up giving you a link to debunk you and it will be to Rick Astley.
Israel didn‚Äôt bomb the hospital. absolutely shameful
People are ridiculous: Here, listen to this video and defferentiate the explosions, if it's loud, it was definitely the people I'm already biased against.Had to edit, cuz I suck at words rn
The people of Palestine won't get there freedom unless the occupation ends
Obviously, they are going to file a formal complaint.
They‚Äôre going to be very embarrassed when it‚Äôs confirmed that it was Palestinians who accidentally did that‚Ä¶
The isreal conflict isn't about hamas isreal wants to make it about hamas to show the world they fighting against terrorism but actually in the west bank hamas doesn't exist still the idf there kills children and do all the bad stuff this conflict is more about land in its real core not religion
I live in the greater Boston MA area. There are quite a few who feel and support Palestine- or at the minimum understand how complex this situation is. Personally- no one is winning and only the poor of both nations will suffer.
Nazi Zionist piece of shit. Free Palestine.
I see a lot of links to videos with people alleging that said video ***shows*** rockets from Hamas firing/misfiring on that hospital. I've yet to see anything that **definitively** shows that from my lay point of view. I think if it's so easy to prove, any legitimate news source e.g. Al Jazeera, the New York Times, Washington Post, etc., will get to the bottom of it and point out exactly what happened within the next 48 hours. That said, I haven't seen any source I trust confirm that, and I think we have plenty of reason to be skeptical. Israel says plenty of things, and they most certainly have a bias.
Please get you a gun mom and learn to use it
For real man. I feel fucking sick. A gang of armed men literally going after one of the most vulnerable people they could possibly find. What a noble bunch of defenders.
Not sure what you are laughing about! Its just facts‚Ä¶ It is another war crime commited by Israel! Despicble! Heartless‚Ä¶ the world is wacthing the genocide going on right now! Lies will last one or two days‚Ä¶
You say "arrests". I say "rescued"üòè
What?  You can‚Äôt be serious.  The blinded see through everything.
For me i believe it for sure cause i know people who faced this kind of shit
Your an idiot.
Dude this woman is famous for this documentary ( she is a jew btw ) try to watch then talk you to get your sources from the media watch to see it makes sense or not
https://x.com/HananyaNaftali/status/1714400598991261966?s=20
Hamas blamed the USA (which is extremely doubtful).Israel blamed a Jihad organization. There is no proof this is an Israeli attack. Quit being brainwashed people‚Ä¶
https://youtu.be/yJMabRbuN3c?si=R2DMACzlH7JqSNZS
Haha, good one
It's so weird to see the phrase "Human shields" tossed around so much in such a nonchalant way the past few days.They're people, humans, hence humans shields. Their presence should deter action. It's not about whose fault it is that those people die, it's a test on who's morality allows for them to live. Right now no one is winning the morality contest.
Get the facts before jumping to conclusion.
Fuck that. Leave it and lock it. People gleefully pounced on some quick anti-Israel propaganda and it‚Äôs interesting to see who holds that same logic to the real perpetrators.
No! It was Israel! Another war crime they commited
Hamas misfired a rocket and bombed its own people
This is a child having his head kneed on. That is absolutely disgusting brutality. The kid did not gun down civilians. You are saying that a separate groups actions, not related to the child, makes it hard for you to care about the adolescent being beat to shit by an adult. You are a fucking disgusting psychopathic pos.
What is the objective in going to the US Embassy?
Belief in Jesus and various flavors of god has started more wars and caused more deaths than anything else I can think of.
Aah then you are referring about nakba? Fuck off, nothing can justify the kindling spree of civilians. Israel is a criminal state, just as hamas is a criminal organization.
Sure bud.  I realize now everything is black and white and I should think as I'm told.  I'll be a better sheep now.  I promise. Fucking
https://www.cair.com/cair_in_the_news/israeli-guards-rape-palestinian-women/
Isn‚Äôt it against the Geneva Convention to target hospitals?
They just want to exterminate the all palestinians and everything that moves over their land. Israel dont even care about their fellow israelies took as hostages by Hama‚Äôs. Not a attempty to rescue them‚Ä¶ Isarael just boooooomb them
Maybe you should read or hear more stories btw i am Egyptian and back in 1973 and before we was in war against isreal cause part of our land ( Sinai ) was occupied i her real stories from old dudes who witnessed this shit my dad was 10 years old then . And the grandparents witnessed it as adults. And if you have ever talked to any Palestinian who lived in the west bank i am pretty sure he has some stories that is dark af
Curious why it would be written in English.
Honest question how does this prove Israel blew up the hospital. Israel won‚Äôt deny they‚Äôve dropped jdams on Gaza. All this video is a jdam falling and exploding you can‚Äôt see what gets blown up just an explosion in the distance
Optimistic to think this guy has a wife
Different one.
This is the issue. The few speak for the many and now the many have an option. Fight back and take back your freedom from Hamas or suffer the same fate. I‚Äôd assume that some portion of this 99% who hate Hamas and have no connection would be able to make a change if they wanted to. But no they let the world view these groups as how Muslims act and how Islam is as a whole even though it‚Äôs not even close.Anyone who I‚Äôve met that‚Äôs told me about the Quran it‚Äôs always seemed to productive and peaceful. So why do these people make the world view it as the population as a whole. Why have they not tied to change it. The subservient nature seems to be the biggest issue.
Thats what pisses me off the most, they have nowhere to go yet Israel bombs everything in sight
I have been saying this since Hamas did the attack on the 7th. They know they can not win a military conflict with Israel. And it never was about being a war with them.It is to drag Israel through the world stage and try to get support for Palenstine and awareness.

Too late, Reddit has already decided who to blame for it.
Not after there‚Äôs no more belligerents left. There‚Äôs a reason there are no Muslim countries taking in Palestinian refugees.
And as a muslim I actually can't wrap my head around how the terrorist groups is Syria , iraq etc think like they do every that against the islamic values (  i think groups like this is just created by brainwashing young people for political reasons)
The proof comes from Al Jazeera, actually. https://twitter.com/yousuf_tw/status/1714367757968384106?s=46&amp;t=t1iC1_zccQC4YqWwURyaBQhttps://twitter.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390274900734049
There has never been a Palestine.  I was correct, you can‚Äôt read.
John Douglas, one of the original FBI agents that developed and ran the profiling department, has co-written several books about true crime. I forget the exact wording, but in one of the books (I think *Obsession* ) he discusses peeping toms and says it should be treated VERY seriously, as it is precursor behavior to basically all rapists and serial killers.
"Trust us bro"
This was a failed hamas rocket that fell in a refugee area. This should be reported as false info. Check out the twitter of their poop tube rocket get hit or malfunction and fall. Yet y‚Äôall wanna blame someone else. Been to the Middle East and I‚Äôve seen this in person as a tactic with out the failed rocket. They blew up a school in front of me in Iraq with kids inside. Like right in front of us. We had injured us military and some Iraqi personnel as well. All the kids died.
Biggest lie ever!
Israelis raping people? Really?  Where did you read (can you read?) about this?
 i know people from gaza they are not what like happened in iraq ( isis and all of this  horrible terrorist groups) i don't they teach their children to don't care about any life that is not muslim
Obviously you eat too much shit, it‚Äôs coming back up ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
#fakenews
No, the evidence is what Hamas reported silly
They haven't had elections ever where they elected hamas hamas leader live in Qatar right now he is he elected and cant even live in gaza this is misinformation its not true hamas call themselves resistance group that they want to free Palestine not a political one
I look forward to fascist being arrested and prosecuted for felony assault.
Guess you‚Äôre lucky they didn‚Äôt charge you with making porn‚Ä¶ sometimes I feel the law protects the perpetrator and screws the victim over
Can someone explain this whole war to me please im uneducated
Maybe stop making rockets out of pipes from the swears. That would be a good start. This isn‚Äôt far off from tactics I‚Äôve seen in ME countries I‚Äôve been in. I have in person witnessed a school be destroyed by militants I. Iraq while we were trying to evacuate people. It‚Äôs their doctrine. If I hadn‚Äôt seen it in person happen so many times I‚Äôd probably  be as ignorant as most people to say right away it was Israel‚Äôs fault. There is a high chance that Hamas kills far more Palestinians than IDF. To them it‚Äôs a great sacrifice or at least that‚Äôs how they raise their kids. Everyone who isn‚Äôt Muslim is the devil and needs to be wiped off the earth. When that‚Äôs what‚Äôs being taught it‚Äôs hard to care anymore for people who think like that. Sacrificing children for some prophet is insane. Just look at us in the USA. These dumb fuck Donnie fans and the worship of the church of the all mighty Cheeto   None of those people are sane they are a danger and a threat and after my run ins with them in my mind I‚Äôve dehumanized them now because they have done the same to non-MAGA.
I dont know what video u mean and also u can search your self on twitter Logically it isnt even possible by hamas bc what was thrown is a bomb not just launched missiles because hamas doesn't have next gen ballistic missiles its not even ballistic its crappy missiles that cost like 50 dollar each or less also u can loot it the 7 oct videos when they used missiles on Israel its was very week missiles that didnt do alot of damage also so safe to assume it wasint them bc they dont possess this power or israel will be burning fire right now it was a bomb thrown by a plane Also this isnt the first war crime Israel committed since the start of this war
[AP news](https://apnews.com/article/hamas-gaza-palestinian-authority-israel-war-ed7018dbaae09b81513daf3bda38109a)

This is indeed terrifying, I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you all OP. Damn pervert and screw a move order, him and his tic tac should‚Äôve got in more trouble than that. Hope that more than just talking happened. I know you said he moved but I wouldn‚Äôt trust it. Keep your gun on you and stay alert.
This is not true there is no elections on it im very sure from different sources some support it but no elections bc they follow the official gov
There's a good recreation of the flight using MS flight simulator on youtube that shows the plane's movements and the ATC recordings. Paints a pretty gruesome picture of the events of flight 93. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR5FHg1rRLE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FR5FHg1rRLE)  The channel has a bunch of informative videos on the subject of 9/11 as well.
The video on Aljazeera shows a rocket going up from Gaza and it going right back down and hitting the hospital. One video you linked is cropped.
Lmao no
Cunts.
You cannot tell what your even looking at in that clip first of all. Israel has 100% dropped jdams. Your right it could be a video of the hospital exploding. But it could be of something else. That video doesn‚Äôt prove anything lmfao

There are also claims now that this was a misfired hamas rocket that was located on/in the hospital
So much Hamas propaganda lately
He'd beat your dick into the ground all day long!
I mean‚Ä¶ whose verification would you want. Do you really trust Hamas as a source of information?
Yes but Hamas controls Gaza lmfao this [https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/10/17/what-is-the-gaza-strip-and-who-controls-it.html](https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2023/10/17/what-is-the-gaza-strip-and-who-controls-it.html)is from CNBC in 2017

Yep, because Israel and the US are known for their honesty.
Palestine. Bring it!
nitial reports claiming IDF strike have been edited to say ‚ÄúHamas claims‚Äù. [video](https://x.com/yousuf_tw/status/1714367757968384106?s=46&amp;t=9UaRDYXc9xiPhkJ9aJnaMQ) shows failed Hamas rocket to be the cause. It‚Äôs what happens when you fire from hospitals and schools. Wouldn‚Äôt be the first time this has occurred.
The IDF has released radar data and drone footage to the US intelligence officials. I guess we will know soon enough.
Well this claim aged like milk
Trash cause iam not pro hamas you now supporting them !! Or you just can't complete a sentence that makes sense you ignorant go learn how to talk
that also hasn't been confirmed by any other source
Also look it this https://twitter.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1714399005399011406?t=Rmv25pXwrWBVagr6_i37HQ&amp;s=19
Seems like enough to get a baseball bat upside his perverted head.
Not true there is a Palestinian gov and they siad they have nothing to do with hamas like how hard to know this (are u mentally challenged?) just search it out hamas doesn't control shit they just throw missiles around weak missiles that cant even destroy buildings
Is this the hospital Hamas bombed?
I‚Äôve got a very bad feeling that the Israelis intend to put an end to the cycle in the most brutal way possible. They have to know that each strike on a civilian target turns every preteen boy within a mile radius into a future Hamas recruit. It‚Äôs easy to see why some choose the path of the martyr when highest possible level of achievement you can aspire to in life is ‚ÄúMayor of the Prison Camp‚Äù.
I know. I thought really? Mother to mother, go fuck yourself. Yours is grown perverted wack job and mine are innocent small children. Geez. Idk what the hell is wrong with people.
there are multiple videos that show the bombing. And then there is that one video aired by Israel that claims it's a miss fired rocket. A video that people are already claiming was taken way before the bombing, and isn't even showing the right area.
Btw your are a fucking racist and inhuman
How can you say Hamas has nothing to do with civilians or there state sponsored media it‚Äôs literally the governing/controlling body whatever you want to call it of gaza Hamas is the government of Gaza lmfaoAlso I understand that much of the Palestinian population doesn‚Äôt support Hamas and are oppressed by them. It‚Äôs war innocents die. Doesn‚Äôt make it good, doesn‚Äôt make it right but that‚Äôs reality and Hamas started this conflict they attacked first. Israel is at least trying to limit innocent casualties, Hamas is targeting innocent civilians. They aren‚Äôt the same
Saying iam nazi is fucking funny you just trying to make me look like i hate jews or something like this cause you can't defend your point in the argument
My god, the shiver that just rocked my entire body reading this stuff!!!
Maybe not committing war crimes so fucking hard to do ?
This post should be removed. It is misinformation to claim to know at this stage who fired the rocket. We should have higher standards than to allow clear false narratives to be posted.
Is the 'evidence' you're speaking of that clearly edited video Israel posted?
They already have white phosphorous so they have the gas chamber even used it on a school full of children that was confirmed to have no Hamas presence nor weapons by human rights groups
You can't even argue mate you keep repeating the same words your trash
Pretty sure you are referring to a different hospital. And it seam like that one was hit by a Hamas rocket misfire https://reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/lS2mYv3PYhEdit geo location https://reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/C4LS9FkOuC
Depending on where you live you could probably justify shooting him for being on your property.

Why every blind in my house is always shut, and a partial reason why I have blackout curtains in every room I use in my house. Not a gun person, but now sleep next to my shotgun when I'm alone at night. I've had stalkers and peeping toms a few times throughout my life, so by now, I'm just a giant ball of PTSD, anxiety, and paranoia. These memories last a lifetime. This video made my palms sweat as soon as the screen popped up. Had to scroll past. Glad you're safe, OP.
Fuck the IDF.
They are disgusting.
Come on Reddit, do your thing and find this asshole.
Where is your evidence for this besides rumors.
Check this out https://twitter.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1714399005399011406?t=Rmv25pXwrWBVagr6_i37HQ&amp;s=19
They will say it was used for launching missiles and mortars they will lie in the media easiest thing they can do the the last 5 days showed how the boombed civilians and civilian infrastructure so laying is very easy for them and also no they didnt bomb it for the fuck of it they bomb it bc they want to wipe is many aids possible for the Palestine people like they did when they cut water and electricity it isnt the first war crime they committed and isnt the last
lol speak for yourself
I'd use a shovel just for the sound effect.
The genocidal maniac said while beating the Arab child to death
You deserve gold! You are so fuckin right! WTH!
But Israel is trying to get innocents out of the way at least Hamas is actively targeting them. Stoping their own people from fleeing. Israel wants to have a Warzone where they can fight this out and kill as little Innocents as possible. Hamas want the exact opposite they want innocents to die on both sides. THEY JUST WANT DEATH. They are jot some noble rebels they are terrorist. Listen to the tale of first responders finding pregnant women with their baby cut out of them then stabbed.
Is this the one they proved was actually Islamic Jihad actually firing rockets at its own people by mistake/lack of technological rockets?
This https://twitter.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1714399005399011406?t=Rmv25pXwrWBVagr6_i37HQ&amp;s=19
Wrong hospital.  Also, there is evidence that was a misfired Palestinian rocket.
Your are fucking inhumane , I wonder how you will feel if your wife is pregnant and she giving birth but she cant go to the  hospital cause idf refuses to make you and her to go threw the check point , your wife gives birth in car the and the twin dies  . That's a fucking real story that happened in the west bank isn't this terrorism ?? Your either blind to the truth or a racist psycho
Where is the evidence that it was Israel that bombed south that‚Äôs what Hamas sponsored media is saying. Israel media denies it and says they saw footage of the explosion and it can from up underneath the road. Blocking it‚Äôs citizens stopping them from escaping because they want meat shields is literally hamas‚Äôs MO there‚Äôs been no evidence that those explosions had anything to do with Israel and no evidence I‚Äôve seen saying it was as Hamas other than the two side pointing fingers.
Yawn, I just heard learned that every single Palestinian everywhere on the planet immediately danced in the streets,rejoiced and drank blood in celebration of Israeli children being beheaded......honest, this is the internet so it must be true.
Oh they use the shit out of video in court despite what they told OP. For instance, camera speeding/red light tickets, or video made by a confidential informant that police don‚Äôt want to take the stand.
Look it this no way hamas did it like hamas doesn't have this power its a terrorist group not a full blown army with next gen tech their missiles is a joke https://twitter.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1714399005399011406?t=Rmv25pXwrWBVagr6_i37HQ&amp;s=19
Its the uk just call the police and press charges
I actually am 100% impartial.  (I wrote that up above as well)  I've got my Palestinian sources for info, but thank you.
Isreal idf raped alot of woman in the west bank and men to , force them go threw check points from street to another and controlling every aspect of life is  not terrorism don't what else is
Look it this no way hamas did it https://twitter.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1714411407968551232?t=Szyy9SSKZt-oOr2QB2TtuA&amp;s=19And this https://twitter.com/jacksonhinklle/status/1714399005399011406?t=Rmv25pXwrWBVagr6_i37HQ&amp;s=19

Seriously! By their logic cameras are completely useless because no one is seeing anything they record "with their own eyes". That is mind blowingly ridiculous.
Fake news, rocket cane from gaza.
Thanks! It's a job I take very serious!
Idk want any one to die i said killing civilians is bad so i am a shill for terrorists but saying they will turn gaza into glass is ok
Simply saying that Hamas is know for using civilian infrastructure and things like churches and mosques cause they know that we care about blowing those things up. They don‚Äôt. Also where is your money evidence that it was even Israel. General consensus atm is that it was a failed Hamas missile strike that blew up there own hospital. Al Jareeza even caught it live.https://reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/LyZOM9c0rR
The al jazzera video is in different time than the bomb and second that was not a failed hamas strike bc hamas doesn't have that bombing power it was a JDAM bomb thrown by a plane there is a video with even the sound of the plane and also Israel it self said they bombed hamas targets in the hospital then take their word back and if u mean by terrorist state media that their children is dying by minute of course i will believe them they are the victems hamas has nothing to do with gazans civilians u can call them terrorist but uncant can innocent civilians media terrorist or terrorism thats brainwashed mind by the westren media also every 15 minutes since this war started one kid from Palestine dies
You're just being racist and you actually saying they will turn gaza into glass that is a thoughts of terrorist tbh
There is. He is just listening to us really.
Pretty much üôÑ
It was a failed Hamas rocket.
W/o warning lol
All of a sudden the antisemitics are concerned about innocent civilians
Say what you like, they don't play favorites. They are equal opportunity assholes.
Yup
All my other neighbors are very elderly. One actually witnessed it but was scared to say anything because he was scared the guy would do something to him so he kept quiet.
It was a misfired Hamas missile!
What do think would of been a appropriate response from Israel then
I have my CCDW and actively carry even in the yard at home. I know too! Lol
You can buy a basic pump 12ga for just $150 OP.  Totally worth it.
Exactly! I was literally dumbfounded.
They were waiting on my restraining order to be signed by a judge so they could serve him with that at the same time they served the arrest warrant. I specifically told them when they first came out that I didn't want him arrested until they could make 100% sure he couldn't come back to his house (40ft from mine) after he got out. Because I knew he wouldn't serve much jail time but would be mad and I was scared he would do something to me out of revenge.
It is beyond creepy‚Äîit's disgusting! Look up "peeping Tom laws," in your state. Most states have laws against what your neighbor is doing. I don't know who you spoke with, but you should look into women's advocacy agencies, and present them with your video evidence.eta: Also look up "criminal trespass."
For real!! I‚Äôm so sorry you had to deal with that but I‚Äôm SO thankful you had the cameras.
I mean, they bombed a hospital.
This is when you want a large dog‚Ä¶
I considered doing so because unfortunately I've been in a similar situation before with an ex and I just knew he'd get out and terrorize me. I thought since I had kids it would be different.
Not gonna lie that part freaked me out even more and I can't even explain why!
Thank you!
Proof?  Or are you fantasizing again.
Remove what he's pulling on, problem solved.
How absolute dare she? Her "baby" was jacking his dick to children who should have been able to be safe in their own home.  Fuck her.
Al jeeraz even caught it live. Missile was launched from inside Gaza it was a failed Hamas strike. I don‚Äôt understand how people trust terrorist state media more than western governments. You should have a healthy heaping of distrust for both sides. The truth usually lies somewhere in the middle.https://reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/LyZOM9c0rREdited to add link
And that enough reason to kill patients in the Hospital ? What a sick mind you have
Sounds like a really good way to get a guy to hate you and want to murder you lmao. Maybe don‚Äôt do that unless you can do it fully anonymously
They airstrike them anyways with and without warning.
I appreciate that! I still go back and forth on whether I made the right moves. So many people telling me I should've done XYZ, ya know? Oh well. What's done is done.
ruined subreddit
Wasn‚Äôt it a failed rocket from Hamas?
This falls perfectly into the definition of lewd and lascivious behavior.  They said it didn't qualify because they didn't want to deal with pressing the charges.
I just said iam against the killing of civilians you say i am nazi iam not pro hamas btw the are just saying any thing to cover the war crimes the fucking idf
And it‚Äôs not because of any religious extremism right? I mean Hamas is a religious extremismist organization.  Flat out. If this was over only the Palestinians not being free then they why is Hamas declaring this a religious war? Freedom is freedom that‚Äôs not freedom that oppression by force and religious extremism.And let me make this very clear I do not condone the lack of humanitarian support for the people who are just civilians trying live or the harm brought on them. But, they have every opportunity to give up Hamas. You don‚Äôt need weapons just eyes and a way to communicate. If only 1% is Hamas as claimed, then why are the 99% violently taking back the power from them? I‚Äôd say it would be a good guess that it‚Äôs around 30-40% support Hamas and about 10-15% being in the party itself.
Nah you‚Äôre just a Nazi in Egypt fuck your tiktok and YouTube videos and fuck you you‚Äôre a shill for terrorists who tried to say the west only labels them terrorists cause we don‚Äôt like them, no we label them terrorists because that‚Äôs what they are. murders and rapists. Isreal is going to glass Gaza and it‚Äôs justified that‚Äôs what the terrorists want anyways right? that‚Äôs why they build tunnels under civilian homes and schools and hospitals like terrorists do like the cartel like any large organized crime or terrorist organizations. You‚Äôre the fool for believing in exactly what hamas wants your to believe while you prance around the comment like some fairy thinking you‚Äôre somehow smarter cause you watch videos and read shit from HAMAS THE TERRORISTS ORGANIZATION! Nazi! Go pick up a sand covered Ak and fight for hamas if you feel so proud and you‚Äôre ‚Äúnot a shill‚Äù for hamas you are you shameless fool!
You‚Äôre replying with a known propagandist saying ‚ÄúLISTEN TO THE SOUND!!‚ÄùHow about you actually take care to read the thread. He links several attacks from Hamas that carry similar payload.
He did get charged with Trespassing 1st and Voyeurism. My Victims Advocate told me the rest about me requesting him to register as a SO.
Yes and not only that but they would have to question my kids and I would never subject them to that unless it was true and they absolutely had to. Sad world that these kids have to grow up in as it is!
Yup.You can tank Hamas for it.Stay in the stone ages, savages.
That is literally what they did. Gave him probation and has to see a therapist at his last court date.

If Israel was right, it would not have deleted 3 of their tweets in one hour. Unfortunately, the world is revealing their lies and they are trying to play the victim.
Well that is so nice of you! I really do appreciate you even offering but honestly I don't even know how to help myself lol

I would be happy seeing them suffer
sometimes the actions of a few portray the many. I think fear and ignorance play a big factor and you usually side with others that have simular views as you when you don't understand them as a whole. I do remember when the Palestinians celebrated in the streets on 911 at the deaths of innocent US civilians. I only add this as my personal insight.I'm not Pro Isreal or Pro Palestine, I'm pro democracy and think a two-party system or even 2 states would be ideal..but the oods of that happening anytime soon are zilch, because the forever war and the mass misinformation from both sides as people push their narrative obscure reality. So unfortunately I think War will be the deciding factor and truth be told...it usually is.
Looking at your comments. You are living the life you deserve.
I wouldn‚Äôt say Israel is as evil as Hamas, they way Hamas treats its people is horrible. But Israel has done its fair share toward the Palestinians. Also Gaza is only half the equation. I think people think Gaza and the West Bank are the same thing and their not.
Kind of misleading.  They were told to evacuate because of the ground offensive not because Israel said they were going to air strike them.

God damn it. My favorite sub is being flooded with war related content. I come here for a mindless entertainment.
Isreali army has not learned anything from the holocaust it is as if for the IDF that the Holocaust did not happen since they have learned nothing from it. The SS caused them to become worst than the monster that was in 1930's.   If Isreal were to get the technological means they would take over the surrounding states and go on conquests like they did all through the old testament. The thirst for blood is unquenchable.
Straight trash
Ewwwww üò≥ü§¢ü§Æü§¨
Look, you made a premature statement I get it.   MSM can't keep up with social media.  But I'm not sure what the above statement means. I'm impartial to this.  All I know is that somebody is lying, and  I have no idea who that is.
Neither does the tora, the Jews are entitled to their land but the acts being committed make them just as bad, and that‚Äôs why even though the Bible says it is their land they will rebel against him. Violence will never solve this
They should try protesting Hamas being in their hospital using them as human shields.
Is it insensitive to have been expecting to hear "WorldStar!!!!" or has the Internet completely ruined me?
momma i am so so so so sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this. you are so strong and thank you so so much for protecting your babies. ‚ù§Ô∏è

To be fair they're also facing 0 punishment for literally eviscerating children though, for them the less kids, and more pieces the better
Now they are playing the Kremlin tow line, if you create enough doubt no one will know what to believe SMH. They are criminals and cowards.
And who sayed they want to killed every one oh western media cause its controlled by people who support isreal and demonic government
https://twitter.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390254935851272?s=20
Mf isreal need to pull itself up by the goddamn bootstraps and quit freeloading and and stealing people's homes ü§£ who gonna humble these lazy motherfuckers?
https://reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/MUZCeVGzt9Your rocket was geo located. Palestinian failed rocket  hit the hospital.
Maybe they should rule their land not any one else and it was Palestine until 1948 ( Israel toke the land by killing ) and even demolished people house back in the days and and toke over people farms and villages and build settlements on them
We just do not know if militants were there or not. What we do know is that they were civilians. What we also know is that this is a war crime. Isreal is no saint and nor are the Palestinians, but this is out right cruel. No amount of justification can be given to justify this mass casualty event.
Gun
Too late, all the top comments are people so fast to call out Israel as evil incarnate. So much propaganda on both sides, people lap it up and propagate it until no one really has a clue what is happening anymore.
Are you ok ? Israel just bombed a hospital containing doctors, children, and nurses, and 1,500 were died in one second, and you say Hamas??
Keep on lying you war criminals
Look at the comments and you will see the Zionists making the news fake as usual
Why would their doctrine be to kill anyone on "their" land? ü§î
Sounds like u only watch the news from the dirty Zionists media
shireen abu aqla was a journalist who who shot with an idf sniper in the last months before This war started how this not considered terrorism ( cause us and eu support them they can't be called that ) it's ridiculous hypocrisy
Sounds like you don't know for sure what happened either lol
Of course, it is fake because it relates to Palestinian Arab souls. Basically, more than 150,000 Palestinian citizens were killed, and the world never moved until a 1000 Israelis were killed on October 7. Now 1,500 Palestinian citizens have been killed in a second. Of course, fake news, Israel is cute and a victim, of course, of courseBut now the world's leaders are reporting the news and accusing Netanyahu of being a war criminal, and the people are issuing statements against him, and the Israeli army is telling 4 lies in one hour, but the world is not stupid.
There  was a Hamas stronghold inside his chest
TIL Hamas is more inclusive than Israel would have you believe, recruiting Down Syndrome fighters /s. Inb4 someone replies ‚ÄúHamas has done this before‚Äù like when I called out attacks on ambulances.
Idf actually killed 1000 child it he last 10 days its mad number nothing ever can be said to justify this , killed journalists to ( even out side of gaza on Lebanon border )
Stop being blind and open your eyes to reality
Yeah, they should really release those hostages. What Hamas is doing to Gaza is horrible.
IDF leaders are war criminals and inhumane and should be punished by law , people who supports Israel are blind as they were misleaded by the western media which is full of hypocrisy.
I‚Äôd would have said it. He should act bullish like this to someone his size, not to volunteers.
The Israeli army presented 4 other lies to the media, about the hospital incident, and the world is waiting to believe its lie, as the world has done for 75 years.. The main problem is that the world does not yet believe that Israel is terrorist and criminal, and that Palestine is occupied and is defending its land and people.
Here's a thread with multiple live streams showing the rockets firing and one failing moments before the explosion at the hospital. The thread also geolocates the explosion in the videos to that hospital.https://twitter.com/GeoConfirmed/status/1714390254935851272?t=t-xAHS2H9fJPviQMk9mvgw&amp;s=19
If there is a video for them killing babies send it me cause the allegations of this babies killed is probably false cause there was a photo that turned to to be ai generated
https://twitter.com/yourfavmemes_/status/1714386016402846058?t=zSiIIkzJykrWn-ClmA3kkw&amp;s=19First video was filmed at the hospital yesterday.
I canttt Israel said at first that it did not know the cause of the explosion that occurred in the hospital, then they said that they had warned the citizens to evacuate, then they said that Hamas may have accidentally hit a missile, and now it says that there were weapons inside the hospital, so it was bombed, and U stupidly respond to tweets from a dirty Israeli account. The liar has been exposed to the world. Canada, the Emirates, and all countries are attacking Netanyahu. Now 1,500 people have died in a second.
We‚Äôll both sides are pointing the finger at this point. But video has emerged of a rocket launching from said hospital and circling around to hit it. I‚Äôm not saying who‚Äôs right or wrong. But if it was Israel I personally believe them to be within their rig by to strike it since said hospital was reported to be housing ballistic missiles and a Hamas HQ. Meaning it is no longer just a hospital. Hamas uses its own citizens to protect its ‚Äúmilitary‚Äù Israel uses its military to protect its people. There is a major difference.
War crime to fire on hospitals.
some of those that work forces...
Hey leave a dog out of this
I don‚Äôt see the violent assault they‚Äôre talking about in the title of this video‚Ä¶?
&gt; People are going to clutch their pearls instead of waiting for reliable confirmation. &gt;Edit: So many people with reality bias here. Watch the video, it's a misfired rocket.lol... you predicted your own edit
I see, thank you. I will certainly look this up and watch that YouTube link shortly and make no further judgment until I do so. I understood about the Eu putting Israel there after the war. I‚Äôm basing my opinion after watching a few Reddit videos of Hamas beheading people and kidnapping civilians and babies, so you understand why I‚Äôm automatically agreeing their terrorists?. However I also understand that Hamas did that for a reason. I will watch the video  thank you and stay safe üëç
You might need to be patient before you make the statement "Why is the media ignoring this?"  It's literally on the front page of every major news outlet.
When Hamasi invaded Isreal yes it did
https://reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/ow5RswvPZu
He‚Äôs doing what I think he‚Äôs doing‚Ä¶ isn‚Äôt he‚Ä¶?
Did they drop on them or throw the people? The grass is still green so I have to ask.
Al Jazeera video showed ithttps://reddit.com/r/CombatFootage/s/ow5RswvPZu
Hams is not very good organization but that's what every government is its to far to call them terrorist organization they are not barbaric isis and this horrible organizations
Robbed of its land... hmmm.. That depends on who you ask. Both sides will tell you they were here first, but the main point is that Hamas and their supporters (Palestine) have enacted terror at a level that is inexcusable. While the Israeli side has also committed atrocities, they haven't done so to the magnitude that the terrorists of Hamas have.

I recommend you to watch documentaries about the occupation before looking at the current situation
It's going on since the beginning of 20th century. Before then there was no hate between Arabs and migrant Jews. The Zionists started all the violence, since they created an ethnostate instead of a secular government which could give rights to all groups. Israel state existence is rooted on ethnical cleansing of Palestinian population.This whole thing about starting thousands of years ago is nothing but a lie.
 Israel has been killing civilians since alot of years even before hamas , Israel was not a country before 1948 , they occupied Palestine by the support of eu and usa , its not just about the fight between hamas and idf
They have like 15 different types of rockets, the largest of which have the same amount of explosive as some cruise missiles.
And this is why these monsters continue to do it - because there‚Äôs no consequences or punishment until it‚Äôs too late and even then the punishment is a menial, lousy fucking sentence. They follow, they harass, they terrorise, they exploit, they rape and unfortunately a lot of the times ends with the victim being murdered. Then the authorities have the fucking audacity to say ‚Äòmistakes were made‚Äô - no shit. Women report these men and nothing happens, and then men (and privileged women who have never had to go through this BS) question why you don‚Äôt report it or criticise and scrutinise your report years after the attack has happened. I truly do hate humanity sometimes. I hope you‚Äôre ok?
Wrong. Please substantiate this claim.
Justice is an illusion.
This is exactly what Hamas wants!
The media is reporting it, it's front and center on CNN. Not to mention it may well have been a defective Hamas rocket. Fake news.
Hamas has a long history of storing munitions inside hospitals and schools: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/07/31/why-hamas-stores-its-weapons-inside-hospitals-mosques-and-schools/Best to wait for more evidence and see what ended up happening.
Genuine question, I‚Äôm not taking sides and am fairly neutral as I don‚Äôt know the facts. All I know in this scenario is Hamas entered Israel, kidnapped and murdered civilians whilst parading their dead bodies through the Gaza Strip, beheaded people including babies (allegedly).  In my mind the precise bombing of Gaza controlled territory is justified retaliation? Am I missing something? I‚Äôm not being funny, genuine question, please educate me?  I understand that civilians are getting caught up in it but what is all the negativity towards Israel for? The fact that they seem to be indiscriminately targeting civilian  infrastructure?. What should Israel do in this situation?‚Ä¶ troop ground attacks? Again, genuine question. üëç
This is horrifying. I think I‚Äôd be moving house after this. My husband is always complaining about me having all the blinds closed in the evenings and this is exactly why .
Yea, I had to google the Pakistan flag to make sure I wasn't mis-remembering wast it looked like.
Just more proof that whether Israel did it or Hamas didi it, the innocent civilians in Gaza have been suffering for a long time!
This subreddit is really here for Hamas propaganda? Congrats you ü§°s
How can I help???? Seriously. Drop a PM.
The Palestinians are NOT innocent bystanders. They tolerate Hamas terrorists and now have to live with the fallout. Only the children are true innocents. Their parents are not.
Human scum like this have no place on this planet except behind bars with the other animals. Even better yet... wiped right off the face of earth by a double barrel shotgun filled with buckshot right between his peepers!!!
hey i found the guy in the video
NSF!!!!   You have 20?  And he hasn‚Äôt been arrested yet?  I‚Äôd be bombarding everyone with these videos until justice is served.  How many damn times do we have to stand by and allow this to escalate into unnecessary and unimaginable tragedy before something is done!
Right, isn‚Äôt that the point of cameras? So I can just whack off looking into your window, but as long as your eyes didn‚Äôt physically see me, even though it‚Äôs on camera, then it‚Äôs fine? No trespassing at least? Or indecent exposure? Fucking SOMETHING?!
This is a different guy. They talk about it in the above comments, and OP says it's similar but not the same douchecanoe
They were 100% wrong in their prosecution. This blatant crime is a felony and much more should have been done. Many victims of this crime never know they are a victim. Many time a search warrant is served on the persons address and they find videos and photos and other ‚Äútrophies‚Äù. Then law enforcement has to go out and find the victims. Very sorry this happened. Please protect yourself. This kind of sick human gets fixated on things and very well could be back.
Fucking media is controlled
Different claims until now
Hamas kills civilians. baaaaadddddIsrael kills civilians. but but but... theres grey areas and they had missles.Warning people that arent allowed to leave because theyre being held hostage, to injured or sick to move, or maybe didnt hear the warning, due to lost power and no communication, doesn't help people. Stop trying to justify your fucking killing. Atleast hamas has the balls to just come out and say they hate these land grabbing shits. Israelis just kill and play victim. No hamas rocket exploded mid area, there was no friendly fire. Hoe do you warn people then say they blew themselves up... Just say you fucking did it cause you hate them and dont care about their civilians because again you hate them, and mak'gora already. We're all waiting.

NO ITS NOT
The Israeli army declares itself that they bombed the hospital. The world is not stupid. You are trying to attribute any killing to Hamas, but Israel's crimes are proven audio and video and will end soon
Nazi detected
Have you seen the damage Hamas rockets do to israeli buildings? They barely blow a hole on the wall. Meanwhile we see everyday footage of israeli bombs bringing entire buildings down. No way a rocket from Hamas instantly blows up an entire hospital
Feel Weinstein
Oh shut the fuck up. Israel is dropping the bombs you dumbass.
To far mate
World War 3 is coming!
Very true
They all have a big mouth until they get punched in the face.
Yes thanks for acknowledging  that I‚Äôm smarter than you.  Not a very high bar though is it.  And mascara is eye make up.  Think the word you are looking for is massacre.  The stuff your Hamas friends do all the time and last I checked they are they only ones cheering for them.
This video is from 2006 or 2005 watch it and till me what you think about the idf https://youtu.be/Q_MDC2Gty4I?feature=shared
From what it seems since this conflict has begun, is the hard facts aren‚Äôt reported as such. One side says one thing, the other says another. It‚Äôs a mess.
The evacuation of the hospital is a suicide. What will they do with patients under resuscitation devices, operations or others? What about the bodies of the dead in the refrigerators? And why is a hospital being bombed?
What are you smoking?
They reposted the video in a separate tweet: https://twitter.com/Israel/status/1714378880713203844
Not to mention their lie didn't even involve Hamas, it accused another group entirely. The bots are just getting the Hamas shouts in early
If you‚Äôve ever been in a high speed car crash, you know this isn‚Äôt true:During highly stressful life and death situations, the brain dumps chemicals and hormones into the bloodstream to create the ‚ÄúTime Perception Dilation‚Äù effect. The experience literally feels like what you see in slow motion footage, including distorted sounds. It can best be described as your brain increasing your perceived *frame rate* so that you can micro react to dangers and hazards. In a physical sense, Neil Tyson is 100% correct. From the passengers perceptive experience, it was probably what felt like a hellish 10 seconds.
People are going to clutch their pearls instead of waiting for reliable confirmation.  Edit: So many people with reality bias here.  Watch the video, it's a misfired rocket.
I have seen this shit and i am against  the killing of any civilians thats why i hate isreal military more cause they have been killing innocent people for years and this has to stop ( even before hamas existed they were killing civilians)
Ask the officers if it‚Äôs legal then for you to go to their daughters or nephews house and jerk off by their window because according to them that‚Äôs a grey area. This isn‚Äôt a a grey area.Public masturbation? Sexual harassment? Trespassing? Indecent exposure? Voyeurism? Stalking? All they‚Äôre doing is effectively waiting for a child to get violated instead of taking measures to prevent it from happening in the first place. They know you don‚Äôt want him doing that, they could just stake out your house and catch him in the act. If the police won‚Äôt do their job what you could do is ask around your neighborhood and see who this guy has offended. They could collect evidence and come to the police. If that doesn‚Äôt work then showing it to his wife (If he has one) should suffice. If not then social media. What he is doing IS a crime and he should face appropriate punishment.Behaviors like this need to be shut down immediately and shouldn‚Äôt be tolerated.
Mossad propaganda
My grandpa tried to catch a guy who did this to my aunt when she was in college. Said he was going to take him out to his woods, string him upside down and put hot tar on his balls.
It was Islamic jihad you morons
Just don't take everything at face value.  One of the many weapons in a war is optics on the world stage.  There's just as many videos that say IDF is killing civilians as videos saying Hamas won't let them evacuate.  It's a win for either side to further vilify the other at any cost.  Just keep in mind who needs the world's support to win.. ill give you a hint it's the same side that's lost every conflict since taking power.
I've muted both of those subs. Racist, bloodthirsty twats the lot of them
It was a Hamas rocket misfire people
I am waiting for more info but not from idf cause they terrorists and have racist leaders
Cherry picking? You want me to type the complete Quran? These verses are what drives these Islamists. That's their ideology. If you don't accept it then you're no different than an ostrich. Keep your head buried while these terrorists plan to take over US just like they did with Europe.Ask any Muslim if he believes and follows these verses and you'll get your answer.
God I wish I could find him. I have some presents üéÅ for him.
Ok judging people with reddit karma is a hole different level of stupidity  , keep cheering up for mascaras and ethnic cleansing you are very smart human
Hamas. It was a failed rocket launched by Hamas.
Saying its friendly fire immediately with out even any proof or investigation is outrageous
Sure sure mate keep believing in the western media
I‚Äôd stick to bear spray. Not because it‚Äôs stronger, but because it sprays more volume so you can coat him. Then if he tries entry, castle doctrine applies.
Zionists could have lived peacefully in Palestine but they didn't they started it and toke the land by killing innocent people
man, that's cherry picking some verses there bud. It's not even the full 2:191 by any english translation. Stop with the 9/11 muslim bully shit, it doesn't work anymore.

Blah blah hamas operatives were inside‚Ä¶Blah blah human shields‚Ä¶Blah blah unintended collateral damage‚Ä¶Blah blah have a right to defend ourselves‚Ä¶Blah blah antisemetic if you disagree‚Ä¶Basically Israels response in a nutshell most likely.  They dont care.  Its a revenge tour for them and allies like the US and just gonna turn the other way and parrot the same response like our allies did when we went WMD hunting in Iraq instead of finishing the job of locating Osama in Afghanistan and then going home.

Man the Israelis are not doing anything right to make anyone want to support them
Palestine one more time
Why is isreal allowed to kill many arabs and make them flee from and rape their with out USA condemning them cause usa uses isreal to have power in the middle east not cause usa cares about jews , have you ever wondered why the western world funds isreal with all this money for what , humanity? Love ? You have to be kidding to believe this man
A 2x4 to the back of the head oughta solve the problem
Fucking Zionists...
Bullshit that's 100% steel. At least 50% Styrofoam filler.
Hasn't Russia been bombing Ukrainian hospitals and apartments for the past 18 months? Why hasn't the middle eastern countries or the Palestinians demanded accountability from Russia on that topic? I believe Iran fully supports the genocide happening in Ukraine but decries hostilities in Gaza. WHAT A HELL OF A WORLD.
It just happened. Wait for the facts.
Yeah not that they refused all the land deals the last 75 years and could have had their own state.
This is a really old video, but either way fuck the IDF.
Will you are the dumb one who eats western propaganda hamas killed 100 civilians idf killed 3000 civilians , seconed its not about religion i don't have anything  against jews or Judaism , plus hamas would have never been existed if isreal didn't occupied Palestine simce 1948 the us has accused the idf of war crime more than any terrorist organization
There have been about 200 Russian attacks on healthcare so far in Ukraine. Just another day in 2023.
Didn‚Äôt see with your own eyes? You caught it on camera! If someone got shot on camera, but no one physically saw it, are we to ignore the video showing proof of the culprit IN ACTION? Fuck, this makes no senseEdit: I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you, this is beyond disgusting, but it seems the system is broken if this is all the action the police/city took
Hamas friendly fire
It's been going on since 13th century BCIt's silly to think that we were going to hash this out over the next two weeks.
Or, hear me out, we‚Äôre going to hold skepticism of both parties who have their best interests in blaming the other for the attack and wait for independent confirmation
Just going to leave these here for anyone who wants to see them. It's Twitter so you don't have to believe it.

Fake news
and we are believing hamas with a 20% rocket failure rate. yeah not buying it. I think they are trying to disguise the embarrassment of bombing a hospital in their own area
![gif](giphy|UoComaq4nCp0GU7VXd)
Jeezus
I mean, kind of the Isrealis fault for thinking that would work. The Hamas fighters are quite literally hiding amongst the people, so they just moved with them when they all started fleeing. Defeated the entire point of ordering the evacuation in the first place.
It's actually useless rockets for bombing and was used as cover for the ground troops Neither hamas or idf should br killing civilians but in numbers idf has killed more civilians and hamas would have never been existed so the main problem heir is the occupiers and them killing civilians since 1948
You‚Äôre dumb bro hamas is a TERRORIST ORGANIZATION! It‚Äôs in their best interests that civilians die especially if they make it look like the idf did it. Why wouldn‚Äôt they bomb their own people? It makes perfect sense for them to do so. Imagine taking hamas the TERRORIST ORGANIZATION as a form of factual evidence! You‚Äôre like one of those idiots that ate up all that bullshit propaganda the nazis made about the Jews being happy and healthy in the camps. You‚Äôre eating hamas shit like ice cream youre just as bad as they are.
Turn that into local news let them dox him.
It sure seems like that, hope to spears information instead of  all the misinformation.
By the way this page has been known for a long time that it is run by the Mossad. It's not an official page.
Al Jazeera showed a hamas rocket fail and land on the hospital.
I guess when Hamas fires 6000 unguided rockets into Isreali cities that's not targeting civilians.
Yes.  I judge who I‚Äôm interacting on this platform by their karma.   And you have none which would indicate a high likelihood that your are a Hamas shill spreading  their propaganda
I have seen all of the footage from the Hamas attacks. Gopro footage from their own head cams. So yeah I saw exactly what they did from their own perspective. They are animals and need to be put down. That is the truth. What I am saying is in no way an attack on the innocent civilians of gaza. Hamas is a terrorist organisation that attempts to use religion to kill and rape innocent civilians.
This hurts, I cannot support my people in this. Israel is wrong. They try to say that they are fighting Hamas when they are fighting Palestine, they are not one in the same. Aside from individuals with disabilities, the entire nation of Israel is IDF or has been. I am ashamed to have Ashkenazi in my blood at this moment.
"...says IDF"
Don't threaten me with a good time
This picture really shows a lot......
And you get to act innocent and let terrorists dig tunnels beneath your home, and launch rockets from the roof.....Yea.
it's so aweful this just keeps getting worse my heart goes out to them
Pro is taking about reddit karma now lol üòÖ
Its not about hamas its about the land of Palestine done with me read more about the history of Zionism since 1917 and you will find the truth
Unlike the Middle East?
and the loss of life and damage was even greater due to the stored weaponry in the hospital by Hamas.
One way to effectively prevent this type of peeking is to put a frosting laminate over the glass of your lower windows.
Search google about it and you will know everything  try a vpn if you are in us or Europe cause the block alot of this shit
It might've been a misfire from Hamas from what I could gather. Only sources right now are Al-Jazeera and Hamas themselves.
Years ago some college friends of mine reported to the cops about a guy wanking off when he pulled up next to them. They called the cops and eventually caught the guy. They had to ask the girls if he had an erection, but they said he did not. I guess the actions cops could take are different if the perp had an erection.
so it actually wasn't Israel but hamas that bombed the hospital and it was because a rocket failedhttps://www.jpost.com/breaking-news/article-768879
Actually in 1948 the Zionist committed a  massacre to get the arabs out of there homes and send them to gaza and the west bank
Which they did.   I believe they were shooting at both tel aviv and Haifa at the time.  I know I‚Äôm not going to convince you but here are the facts:Hospital has been blown up. Hamas say the IDF did it!IDF says we don‚Äôt target hospitals and we don‚Äôt know what happened and are investigating.  Choose what you want to believe.  I will wait for more facts.
Honestly with everything I've seen on this thread it sounds like you handled this really well with a lot of patience and class. Can't say I'd have been able to remain composed with someone like that but respect for the way you handled this, sincerely.
Nonsense - after this hospital, and the next one, by the time they bomb the school for blind children, the U.S. will definitely send a letter to the Israeli PM suggesting that they should, possibly - if it is not too much trouble that is - consider using smaller bombs that explode less
Ain‚Äôt that the truth, it was all about the little guy(Taiwan, Ukraine) till Palestine entered the chat.
Humanity has died today.
And Hamas does war crimes everydayBut I‚Äôm done wasting my time with a 2 karma Hamas shill
 ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs getting bad, Dad‚ÄîA stewardess was stabbed‚ÄîThey seem to have knives and mace‚ÄîThey said they have a bomb . . . I don‚Äôt think the pilot is flying the plane‚ÄîI think we are going down‚ÄîI think they intend to go to Chicago or someplace and fly into a building‚ÄîDon‚Äôt worry, Dad‚ÄîIf it happens, it‚Äôll be very fast‚ÄîMy God, my God.‚Äù33 The hijackers killed pilots and passengers &amp; spoke of having a bomb on the plane. Nobody was sitting tight ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
‚ÄúGroup claiming other group bombed hospital, actually bombed hospital‚Äù lmaoYou‚Äôre just going to be naive and believe everything terrorists say. Grow up.
Its maybe possible but every time hamas lunches rockets they immediately report it throw their media they say like we are gonna fire tel aviv with 100 rockets
Nice
Either way if Israel bombed it they were housing and launching ballistic missiles from it. And they were also calling for a hospitals evacuation so they could bomb it. So they have been given warnings and it‚Äôs no longer a non combatant zone when missiles are slinging out of it. Unfortunately there is a lot of grey area in war and no matter who‚Äôs right innocents are going to die. That‚Äôs war. Doesn‚Äôt make it good doesn‚Äôt make it right. And you don‚Äôt have to like it but that‚Äôs the reality. Hamas started this war. Also they reported 500 dead right after it blew up there was absolutely no way to have a confirmed casualty count 3rd Hamas wants there innocents to die so they can call Israel criminals and gain support killing or allowing there own people to get killed for there cause is pretty much their mo. They are stoping humanitarian aid. People should be calling for liberating palastine from under hamas‚Äôs control. It‚Äôs not plastinians it‚Äôs Hamas
That‚Äôd be one or both of ur parents.
Wow. That's creepy and scary AF! I hope he's in jail by the time you posted this.
My worst nightmare
And isreal has been accused of dozen's of war crimes in the last 75 years its not like something they haven't done before
How about one of the 1/3 of Hamas rockets they fire that crash in Gaza?    That‚Äôs certainly a possibilityGiven they were firing rockets off at the time I‚Äôd say it‚Äôs a very real possibility
Oh, what the actual fuck.  A man who would do this would 100% r*pe
Ikr Jesus Christ, those subs went from supporting Ukraine to supporting ethnic cleansing in Gaza in a heartbeat
Actually it is
‚ÄúGroup accused of bombing hospital states that they didn‚Äôt bomb hospital‚Äù lmao
Fair points, but I think we also have to recognize that even Nazis were a spectrum of ideas; some were full blown supporters of gas chambers, some were content with deportation, some didn't even hate Jews. The actual genocide didn't start in a vacuum, it started with events like this.**However**, I completely understand where you're coming from and lastly I think we can all agree that this man is being an absolute clown. Have a good day!
The idf has been bombing gaza for 10 days straight who would it be
Ewww is he rubbing his little wang doodle on your house? Fucking gross.
Hamas also kills and intimidates its own people. Everyone seems to forget this. Let‚Äôs wait for all the facts, they matter
Police: "This is a civil matter."
Israel didnt walk in there with 1000 troops and selectively kill and rape women, babies and the elderly. I understand this is a long standing war that spans generations. But this bloodshed, right now was caused by hamas.
Well said
Listen man killing of innocents is condemned by islam and if hamas did such acts in the scale the media says I agree that hamas are being pussies but wheres the source? Like one article talking about injured children in isreal literally used a pic from Palestine
And there would be no occupied Palestine if they would have accepted anyone of the many two state solutions they have been offered over the last 100 years or soBut I don‚Äôt need to go down that rathole with you.  If aren‚Äôt aren‚Äôt able to condemn the Oct 7th murder spree then there is no point in engaging you
This is a failed launch by Hamas, there is also evidence that they will soon be released
Who the fuck bombs a hospital?
Everyone is responsible for their actions mate
Hamas would have never come to exist if Israel didn't occupied Palestine so by your logic isreal is actually responsible for this bloodshed
You were told that by who? That's complete BS either way. If I were you, I'd reach out to any and every media outlet and tell them the story and how no one is willing to help. This is trespassing at the bare minimum.
i'm so glad you and your kids are okay...my god, this really is terrifying as fuck. I felt sick literally just reading your post, i am just so sorry for what you have been through!!! and bless your soul for trying to look out for others safety üíô
Don‚Äôt tell that to the genocidal freaks in the world news or Europe subs. It‚Äôs honestly stunning seeing the discourse and how this conflict is being covered.
I know how it started in 7th oct but before was there killing and wars between isreal and Palestinians its not they started it for no reason Note : there would be no hamas if Israel didn't occupied Palestine
Exactly, this is going to add at least another century of hate.

Hopefully the country implodes on Hamas. They are the ones who are responsible for this bloodshed.
No, thats what youre reading into it because youre pro Hamas/Palestine. What Israel is doing by hitting civilians structures harboring Hamas is bad. What Israel is doing by kicking palestinians out of their homes is bad. You're struggling to say both are bad and I'm not. I'm pro innocent civilians on both side. The Israel government and the civilians the support it are bad; Hamas and the civilians that support them are just as bad. I think you fail to understand that if Hamas had the military and technology that Israel has that they'd wipe Israel off the map.
The idf for sure say any thing to get out of this but tbh idon't  think hamas is going to bomb there people like some this people is the hospital might be relative with people who died in the bombing
The Gaza health ministry says that?Aren‚Äôt they Hamas?   Pretty sure all of Gaza is controlled by Hamas.   Instead of just parroting their propaganda why don‚Äôt you stick to actual known facts.   Hospital blown up.  It‚Äôs a tragedy.   How it blew up is not yet known.
Are you crazy? Tell me the dealer because damn those drugs must hit hard. You‚Äôre asking how could someone support a country that was robbed of its land and had innumerable amounts of its people killed including the restrictions that were imposed on them(most of them can‚Äôt get any clean water)? Is that what you‚Äôre asking?
I really can‚Äôt be arsed. You seem to be putting more effort into Hamas Bad than IDF Bad Too. You pointed out Hamas kill people abroad. My point was that so does the IDF. They seem to drop more technologically advanced weaponry from airplanes on neighbouring countries than Hamas do.
Say Palestine one more time I dare you. I double dare you!
It‚Äôs all very tragic.   Try not to lose sight of how this round of war started.
So who is saying it was the IDF then?
If HAMAS was using it as a staging area to fire missiles/mortars then it becomes a viable target. If Isreal bombed it for just the fuck of it then that is a war crime.
It will partly be happy crying, at least. After reading The Only Plane in the Sky, I just wanted to curl up in a ball and contemplate man's inhumanity to man. The Day the World Came to Town really lifted my spirit back up in a way that I don't think something completely unrelated could have. Also, I want the citizens of Gander to adopt me and collectively be my mommy. I can't imagine a more nurturing group of people.
Yes, may they rest in peace. That said, comparing his behavior in this one clip to being like Nazi ideology bilittles the extreme nature if the atrocities they commited. For example, just because you forget things, or like things done a certain way, that doesn't mean you have full blown ADHD or OCD, its a misrepresentation of how serious and life effecting those conditions are for the people who have them.While he might be acting like a tyrant, a bigot, a racist, a fascist, or any other mix of bad words, we can also acknowledge not all tyrants were as bad as the nazi's that damn near accomplished the genocide of the jews and gypsies and started a world War leading to the death of 10s of millions of people accross the globe.
Likely fratricide/murder by Hamas. Video released showing Hamas rocket circling back after launch.
Why is there so much hate?
&gt; People with DS are literally sunshine and rainbowsI'm gonna stop you right there. Let me tell you a story about Phillip. He had DS and was in my school during my 4th and 5th grade years. He was part of a classroom of other students with challenges. This man was W I L D.I remember one day he had his locker open and he was trying to put his bookbag in side ways into a tall thin locker. Got fed up and started slamming his backpack and fists all around the hall. Hitting lockers and activity boards and all kinds of shit. Just screaming. One time me and my friend were on our way to the nurses office to get our noontime medication we were both on. We stopped into the bathroom and saw Phillip standing at the urinal pants OFF, not down, OFF and a fat turd just relaxing on the floor while he was just standing at the urinal heavy breathing like someone would who was cartoonishly angry. Like breathing through his teeth.Another time we were walking singe file to lunch and we walked past "the room" and Phillip busted out of the door like Kramer in Seinfeld, because he didn't want to wait for his classes lunch shift. 2 teachers from the class ran out and one tried to put her hand on him, like I guess his shoulder or something it happened too fast for me to remember, but Phillip whipped her around to the other side of him as if he was pulling nothing at all. Idk if it was because she wasn't prepared for that reaction and had no resistance or if Phillip was just built ford tough. It took like 4 people to get him controlled and calmed down. Phillip was a raging berserker and my very first introduction to DS.

Nazis have been real quiet since this dropped
Fair enough. I'm sorry that happened to our family.Either way, I don't think they were calling the man a nazi, they were comparing his hatred to that of nazi ideology
yeah, what the absolite F, now the hospital.   The last thing Israel should be doing is committing war crimes here.
You are vile and disgusting.
Its not their own missile i have never a hamas rocket causing this damage
[Israeli Strike on Gaza Hospital](https://www.thedailybeast.com/at-least-500-killed-in-gaza-city-hospital-blast-health-ministry-says)
Still can't bomb  the hospital. You don't bomb hospitals period.
Idf said they are not gonna target civilians but more than 1000 child has died in gaza since the start of this war
My great grandmother did not survive the holocaust, and my great grandfather and grandfather hardly made it out either. They absolutely would take offense to calling this bigot shopper a Nazi
No shit everyone knew that, still can't bomb the hospital.
Hamas didn't say anything yet
But don‚Äôt you see? Of course Isreal was going to attack after being attacked, hamas  counts on getting civilians killed so they can wail and bemoan the shit ass situation and blame Isreal. To pretend it is some other way is as wilfully ignorant as killing people in the name of some fictitious sky god to proclaim fealty to your chosen prophet or messiah or whatever. There is no god there is no heaven or hell, we have flown high enough and drilled deep enough that it is fact. If you turn to a fictional book when you are feeling down at least go for good authors, none of this justification to either fuck or stab people to get your message across. Bunch of ignorant assholes.
And there is information that the hospital has been in use as military base even the media who support isreal didn't say this
My grandmother barely survived Auschwitz, and I can guarantee you she would find no problem with comparing Nazi German treatment of Jews with Israeli forces villifying, harrassing, rounding up and killing Palestinian civilians.The Palestine-Israeli conflict isn't black and white, but the comparison is **perfectly** valid!
free Palestine
Hamas are the angry pointed end of the spear...the exceptional brutality displayed recently is a result of decades of persecution, murder, apartheid and land and home stealing, thousands of  palestinians have been displaced, the Gaza strip is no more than an open air prison.The fact that Israel blatantly announced it was going to commit a war crime by not only bombing civilians but deliberately denying food water and power is abysmal
They said they won't target hospitals that's why civilians toke at as a shelter to don't get bombed and they still did
Not really surprised. Italy elected their first far-right leader since WW2 last year.
Omg terrifying how this person is doing this to you.  I‚Äôve been in a similar situation at a place I lived and it was horrible.   Hopefully the people he‚Äôs by now are on to him.  I got chills.
Well if Hamas had not used it as a military base/staging area it would not have been a target. Once again any the blame goes squarely at the feet of Hamas.
This is what it‚Äôs come to. Palestinians need to remove and give up by any means possible all of Hamas. Simple as that. If they don‚Äôt we obviously need to take this back to ancient siege tactics till a population turns on their captors like the Palestinians should with Hamas. Israelis are not responsible for Hamas. Just like election interference here in the USA, or when France had the recent riots, did anyone come step in? No! No they did not! And as a country, especially this case where Palestinians want a free Palestine, that won‚Äôt happen when you elect a terror group. As a ‚Äúwant to be a free country‚Äù electing oppressors sounds counter productive.
How do we know its their missle or idf boming
Crime against humanity.
Just tell them your underage kids saw him in the act. He will land on the predators list. You need to understand the system in order to make it work for you. With something this heinous, it‚Äôs not a false accusation it‚Äôs only a matter of time.
‚ÄúMein Kampf‚Äù is a Bible to Hamas. It is a best seller in their community.
Why? The West didn't give a fuck so far, you think bombing one hospital is gonna change that? They bombed schools, hospitals and convoys fleeing alive. And the US and EU stand by.
Arent all Palestinians a little mentally slow?
Now he lives somewhere else and those people are in danger. And the system just told him it‚Äôs only 4 days in jail.  Until he get the courage to break in and assault someone.  Blows my fking mind. I can‚Äôt believe this is taken so lightly
IDF has said they don‚Äôt target hospitals and investigation is starting to determine what happenedAccepting whatever Hamas claims as fact without any question is ridiculous.
Nobody is ignoring it, they just dont give a shit
I would agree except there are nukes involved now so it's harder to "stay out of it"
IT WAS THEIR OWN MISSILE...     FAKE NEWS....   fuktards
My husband would do the same to protect us. What a sick predator.
How did he have 20 opportunities to do this? I'd think after the 1st video the police would pick his ass up.
What a sick freak. I am so so glad he‚Äôs gone and you and your children are safe.
Maybe it‚Äôs somebody with important connections?I can‚Äôt imagine a normal person a) does this but b) also acts as conspicuously as if he knows he‚Äôs going to get away with it like this guy does
Wow I‚Äôm just fresh out of sympathy for Palestinians. They have no one to blame but themselves for their treatment.
Every day I‚Äôm constantly reinforced with the fact that the law is useless and it‚Äôs better to just brutally assault people with a blunt object than to even call the police when you are the victim of a crime. Especially as a first time offender, even if you were tired for assault you‚Äôd get a slap on the wrist. Laws are so stupid when they aren‚Äôt ever enforced
Imagine that you think ANY of this conflict is right and just.

Your PD shrugged you off.
First of all, insulting someone means you have lost control of your emotions and also lost the argument because you're not actually arguing the points at hand. Second, Hamas is an extension the Muslim Brotherhood from Egypt, so no the US and the Isrealis did not create them. No one is"forced," to vote. Third, there were only 200k Palestinians at the end of WW1. Plenty of room for the Jews, and they were actually welcomed by some Arabs/Palestinians. So no, not 80 years. Throwing out a bunch of random numbers is a fallacy.
So this is where they get the Victoria's Secret models now
The end game looks like they will claim all of Gaza. Making life miserable for palenstians,  to the point they give up and leave.  No power, no water, no outside resources.  Removing people from there homes.  None of that has anything to do with Hamas.
No no guys he's clearly a Hamas fighter, those brave soldiers are protecting Israelis from terrorists /s
Of course, hamas killing civilians is bad, but that's the entire point of bombing them in Gaza. Israel has already killed thousands of children before hamas shot up the festival.
Baseball bat home run
Maybe he's so upset over the fact that he believes the money is going to Hamas which uses it to fund it's terror campaing against Israel and not the inocent Palestenian people who need it the most??
The US and Israel created Hamas moron. Because secular and socialist PLO couldn't be controlled by them.Palestinians were forced to vote for radicalised hamas in 2006 for that reason, because Israel supported it. Al Queda, ISIS, Muslim Brotherhood. All of them were their creation and fucked ME up because they didn't want the region to progress.Not to mention half of today's Palestinians weren't even alive back then. They don't support it, they have no other choice and their patience has hit rock bottom because of the apartheid.Similar situations have been happening every single day for 80 years against Palestinians.
Hamas is a legitimate resistance according to three democratically voted for UN Resolutions in case anyone is wondering.
I'd go next door and beat the shit out of the guy. Fuck that guy.
No it's very intentional. Israel has very carefully created this problem so that they can argue the only solution is their ethnic cleansing.
Yeah thats bad. Can you also say Hamas murdering civilians is bad?Can you say the assassinations, civil wars, etc. that palestinians bring into other countries is bad as well?Yeah what Israel is doing is terrible but lets not pretend Hamas and palestinians are saints here. Both side are bad and violence needs to stop.
What the actual fucking fuck????
Horrible
Fuck these assholes for beating up a disabled person who can't defend themselves. I was neutral before bc I don't know enough history about the region...but assaulting a person with Down Syndrome is one of the most despicable things ever. It's absolutely disgusting. If this is what the IDF has been doing to Palestine all this time...I fully understand now why Hamas has the support they have. Fuck the IDF. This is so disgusting and despicable.
Who lives in a crumbling ghetto being turned into a parking lot right now. It's obvious who's actually being exterminated.
I will expecting a beat down but I saw light assault.
I just struggle to believe in Israel's "Trust me bro" stuff they have going on
So Israel is trying to exterminate an entire race of people now with starvation and warmongering, just missing the gas chambers. Israel‚â†all jews.
It‚Äôs literally on the front page of CNN.  Why would you say the media is ignoring it?
Israel told people to move south and then bombed south too.
American here. That's the first thing I thought lol
And so the cycle of radicalization continues. This will never end.

Israel warned Palestinains to left their homes. It will be bombed. Indeed, the Palestinians left their homes and Israel bombed their homes and killed them in the street!! How do you say a country wants a hospital to be bombed? Why bomb a hospital with patients, doctors, and children? What is your evidence that this  Hamas center at all
So what do you expect from Israelis?
waste man
Well, if they've been treated like this for years, are you surprised?
I expect them to act as humans, not monsters, find peace, and create a bridge with the Isrealis.
It is true sadly . And what make it worse that they will paint you as the evil one if you don't agree with them. When you tell them to discuss they just keep repeating the same thing without even trying to understand the other point of view
You‚Äôd be surprised how many predators dawn police uniforms‚Ä¶
Israel has been warning palastine for days to evacuate that hospital. Telling them they were going to bomb it. I‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs no longer a protected facility when it‚Äôs housing ballistic missile. Unfortunately war isn‚Äôt black and white.
This is the "New U.S. justice system"...oh, we'll just slap him on the wrist, send him to a psychiatrist and confirm he has mental issues. Then, let'em back out to continue his public fapping.
get a gun and a safe and learn how to use it...i know i know...but it is better to have a gun and not need it than to need a gun and not have it
His shopping bag has strawberries or hearts on it?
This incompetent waste of oxygen is just spam posting the same shit on different posts.
Whatever they "said" worked better than the system because the man doesn't even want to come back here for court. Thanks! Stay safe!
Thank you! Stay safe yourself!
That's why I pushed and pushed for him to be a registered offender so his next neighbors could potentially be warned. He was pushing on my windows to see they were open and very obviously looking for a spare key. I'm actually lucky that I caught it early I guess.
You should try to read more than you type because you're extremely incompetent at both. Regurgitating one sided accounts of a very easily researchable geopolitical topic doesn't do near as much to warrant your smug attempts at quipping as you seem to think. All you can do is chirp and hope people die, because your life and thoughts have genuinely no extrapolative substance, it's like an animal that can just mimic what he's been told. I doubt you even read half of the shit you pasted in there. Keep making logical fallacies and false dissertations 8 sub comments down on topics you don't understand:) Enjoy your teeth before someone knocks them out for your boy genius wannabe historian nazi rants
This whole situation is awful.
I could‚Äôve told ya they died instantly and I ain‚Äôt no astronomer.
Because a large portion of this species is not capable of critical thinking.  Common sense ain't too common
I‚Äôll drink to that!!
Like a Nazi not realising he's a nazi
and no morals
Do you know what it's like to live as a Palestinian in Gaza, west bank, or Jerusalem? What do you expect them to support?
Hamas was firing rockets from there‚Ä¶Apparently one rocket from Hamas blew up as it was fired. Not sure what to believe though
They are Evil.   Like Hamas....
When you said your family talked to him, I really hope they TALKED to him. ffs. I'm glad your nightmare is over op
What a sad, pathetic life this loser is living.
Yes and so does Hamas. Whats your point? Both cant be bad?
It's also a reminder that in some parts of the world a man can rape another man and it not be considered gay on his part, but a humiliation to the guy being raped... I guess in an odd way, there is nothing more manly than fucking another man.
You know the IDF kills people abroad too, right?
Truly is. I don‚Äôt think there really is a solution when everyone wants to exterminate each other. Even if some peace was pulled off, there‚Äôs always people that will want to reignite the violence
Guy needs to make friends with some buckshot.
Sounds good as well. He should feel that fear. I hope that you're protected and this never happens to you again.
Endless cycle of revenge. Sad shit.
The whole world must see this and know who is the real terrorist200-300 innocent people have been turned into pieces for one crime which is being Palestinian
This is so fucked up on so many levels. My heart breaks for that poor man. Alan Dershowitz would blame the disabled man for this interaction.
These cowards have no limits
With the paranoia and how it has stolen my peace in my own home, I hope that large man keeps him alive and he just has to lay wait for that man every night üòè
Zionists are such pieces of shit.
‚ÄúHang about. Are we the bad guys?‚Äù
What do you mean? Its litterly the same for anyone standing for palestine and not hamas. God people are so closed minded.
Let us not forget the assassinations and civil wars that palestine brings with them into other countries. IDF killing civilians isnt good but Hamas killing civilians isnt good either (you forgot to mention that).Civs of Palestine overwhelmingly support Hamas.Civs of Israel overwhelmingly support their government.The only victims are the civilians on both side against this violence.
You just won the internet today. Gold.
Not gonna lie, I considered not calling the law, letting my girls stay with my sister and just waiting for him. But I'd be put in jail and my girls would be without their mama so ü§∑
Why didn't his flashy wardrobe choices and tons of cash save him from the responsibility of doing stuff all?
Bizarre but i think thats true, the risk of getting caught gives him the kick/adrenaline rush
The Israeli government and many of their supporters have been very good at pointing out that Palestinians are scum who should be murdered in cold blood, that it‚Äôs their fault that this is all happening to them, that killing civilians is just something that happens (in an open prison). They seem to think shooting fish in a barrel is payback. Maybe consider that people who support Palestinians are trying to paint a picture of the IDF for what they might truly be?
Apartheid
üëçüòÇ
What he said is pretty obvious right?
Yes! Omfg I could've knocked her straight. She said she knew he had issues but helped her out at home. Too bad. I have my own two small girls to look after and he is a threat to us. The cops just told me that was all they could do and their hands were tied.

That's what I thought at first but damn, people need to start setting up more cameras apparently
Agreed that it‚Äôs inflammatory and unnecessary if this occurred years ago. Am surprised that 58% of Palestinians support Hamas, I thought it would be higher. I wonder how the IDF make sure they only deal with the 58% of *bad Palestinians* when they‚Äôre killing people, and still support and protect the 42% of *good Palestinians*. Don‚Äôt get me wrong: what Hamas did was an atrocity and I condemn it, but I think I have some understanding as to what happens when you poke a bear for years and, one day, it breaks its chains.
I bet there are VERY FEW countries on the planet that haven't commit war crimes.
That's what I said! I was like "Are you kidding, YOU are also seeing this?!"
There's a whole section at the front of the CNN website talking about the atrocities in Gaza.  I'm sure if you turn to FOX news, it's all about Israel.  Go to Aljazeera if you want a middle east perspective.
He threatened to fuck that other man in the ass, that‚Äôs a new level of anger I have not experienced.
Ladies and gentleman the U.S. justice system.
Worth working on a new law
Holy crap! They look the same,even wearing the same style shorts. GROSS! Chemically castrate all pedos and rapists. This is the way because this isn't just looking at pics in the computer anymore(which is horrible enough) but now they are literally a few ft away from someone's Child and that's Really freakin frightening! Because these guys obviously have No impulse control and one day they can easily take it wven further than watching them. Gahhh!! This stuff is so infuriating!
This is more than just stalking
It's spelt, "accurate"
They are such good men, really. They hate seeing anyone, not just family, being done wrong!I actively CC'D and have always had a bit of a guard up but man, the paranoia is a little much at this point. Thanks for the response!
Implying Israel hasn't been doing this for 70 years. If anything, the Hamas attack was the retaliation. Not this.
It depends on the state and the particular laws are written.  Also if it‚Äôs his first offense he may have accepted a plea- part of which included staying off the SOR
I‚Äôm happy you and your family are staying safe. Sorry your family is going through this, it‚Äôs got to be stressful.
Someone needs to knock that guy the fuck out
Should they support Israel, and do you have a link to this poll?Of this 58%, how many of them support violence against Israel?Shame on you for pulling a statistic to reinforce your opinion, and cause more hatred towards the innocent Palestinian civilians being slaughtered by Israel.
It was seen with my own eyes, it‚Äôs on the god damn video lol
Oh I was soooo mad I started crying. I was so worried for his next neighbors!
This isn‚Äôt even a metaphor for the war. This is literally an example of a pro-Israeli violent micro-aggression against pro-Palestinians. This man is a psychopath and shows the collective mental illness and brainwashing done by Israel‚Äôs fascist ideology.
I have multiple. I also always CC even when me and the girls are just outside in our yard or going for walks. But I had no idea this was going on until I randomly checked my cameras after having them up for 4 days. He never tried to enter when I was at home.
OMG‚Ä¶congrats‚Ä¶dumbest comment ever.
Haven't done anything wrong? I'll have you know these people were born Muslim.  /s
wow. i‚Äôm so sorry that you had this experience with people in your community and i‚Äôm glad he was not able to get to your children. apparently we all need to live in gated fortresses with castle motes to keep people like this far away from our kids :\
All of Gaza is one big residential area are you stupid?
Yes really old. Theres a current propaganda effort to make Israel look like they deserved it (Yes Israel has done awful things and so has Palestine - both can be bad).  This is a coordinated effort rn across redditEdit: which side did I piss off? lol
Bonus
I dont get it because they both can be bad at the same time. IDF does awful shit and so does Hamas
I hope he dies a slow painful death at the hands of a large man in prison.
He posted bail 4 days later.
Absolutely. It worked wonders. Better than the law.
See, you don‚Äôt really need to explain that man has the Downs. Anyone with a functioning break can see that man has the Downs. You either have to be at the bottom tier IQ or just pure evil to do this.
Right so Palestine IS Hamas, got itüëçüèª
Shh don't say this. Reddit doesn't like it. I got massively down voted for saying this. The OP should say what the guy did for this to happen to him. Isreal forces didn't just go up to guy with DS and best him up like the reporter/op/nedia/propaganda want you to believe.
Prowling. I'm pretty sure that's the correct term here. It is an offense in most places. Good luck.
Are you that dumb? ... Oh wait, silly question. All fascists are dumb and incapable of being truthful
I wonder the EXACT same thing. Cops said it's just the "thrill of you being on the other side and potentially getting caught."
No I'm in Kentucky. But that is sick. My daughters are 4 and 6 and we still take baths together. Might be weird to some but we have a blast having bubble bath tea parties! Lol This creep is standing outside my bathroom window while we are in the bathtub doing exactly that. He can't even see us. He is JUST LISTENING to us.
I said it for you fuck these people they deserve the electric chair mods can ban me i dont fucking care.
You forgot the /s
Too much of this propaganda here ü§£
But he would've fucked you in the ass!
What's the difference between a Nazi sympathiser and an Israel sympathiser? .... There's isn't one
Okay so then they Shouldn't be able to use video footage in the courtroom for other things. WTF is this logic?
Please buy a firearm if you don‚Äôt already to protect your family from this creep, sorry you‚Äôre going through this.
I am truly grateful. They would do that for anyone who was in that situation though. Good men.
Underrated comment.
I don't know because I was told not to ask. I haven't even caught a glimpse of him from that next morning forward and can only assume what happened. His mother knocked on my door 2 days later and asked me to "call my dogs off so her baby could come back home and what I had done was worse than what he done." I told her I had no idea what she was talking about (which is not a lie) that I felt sorry for her and her grandkids but she needed to get off my property.
Holy shit! My fil owns those 2 buildings!
The fascist propaganda of getting us to believe the oppressor is the oppressed and the oppressed is the oppressor. Israel is hands down the oppressor. Most countries in the world know this. But fascist propaganda is strong in America and Europe.
Your response made me smile.I was once married into a family that had the kind of men you mentioned. Cool as hell to me, but boy-oh-boy I would *not* want to have them angry at me.Glad this weirdo is out of the county, but still be vigilant. These freaks sometimes will pop back up. I hate the world sometimes.
‚ÄúIn previous conflicts Amnesty International has documented that Palestinian armed groups have stored munitions in and fired indiscriminate rockets from residential areas in the Gaza Strip in violation of international humanitarian law. Reports have also emerged during the current conflict of Hamas urging residents to ignore Israeli warnings to evacuate.‚ÄùFrom your own link, my god. Did you even read it? These are clear cases of using non combat civilians as shields. Do you have any critical thinking skills?Ignoring that: they have hundreds of hostages from all over the world inside Gaza. Are those not human shields? I‚Äôm sure there are more instances, given your link contained two by itself.Downvoted for quoting their source. Smh Reddit siding with Hamas over Palestinians.
Hitler exterminated the mentally handicapped. Look for the administration/regime that‚Äôs displacing/killing disabled people. That‚Äôs the fascist one.
What the fuck? How infuriating!I hope you and your children are safe now!
I did not ask what they "talked about" because I was told not to. All I know is I did not even catch a glimpse of him from that point forward and a friend of mine at the courthouse told me he had called up there to ask to start having his court proceedings in another county because he moved.  I am small and quite the pacifist myself but the men in my family are very much the opposite. It's untelling what happened to that man.
58% of Palestinians support Hamas. Let that sink in.
There has never EVER been evidence of Hamas using human shield besides the claims of Zionist scums&gt;Amnesty International is monitoring and investigating such reports, but does not have evidence at this point that Palestinian civilians have been intentionally used by Hamas or Palestinian armed groups during the current hostilities to ‚Äúshield‚Äù specific locations or military personnel or equipment from Israeli attacks.Per [Amnesty International in 2014](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2014/07/israelgaza-conflict-questions-and-answers/)There has been however [this](https://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2009%2F03%2F25%2F69194), showing IDF troops tying a Palestine kid to their humvees windshield as human shields, you fucking scum
58% of Palestinians support Hamas. Let that sink in.
A sarcastic comment will work on Reddit but not in the real world. If someone attacks a soldier, it doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôre intellectually disabled or not.
And what do you think was the cause for that attack? Probably not enduring that same shit what Israel had to experience in one day for decades now.
Who gives moral and financial support to them? Who was it in the streets celebrating after word of the attacks on Israel started coming out? Civilians that is who. Sad but Israel might have to go down the path that the Allies of WWII had to go down, bomb the population into submission to the point of where there is no will left to support those able to fight. We proved it worked back then and with decades of concessions from Israel that hasn't work this might be their only option.
This happened YEARS AGO!!! Shame on OP for trying to cause cause more hatred towards Israelis.58% of Palestinians support Hamas. Let that sink in.
"Imma fuck you in the ass!" So what I'm getting from this conversation is that you are gay and want to start a relationship with me?
By that logic, Hamas is Palestine.
Ha! I think Vermont and Texas are more alike than anyone thought!
*bites lip* Palastine, come fuck my ass
Also, Hamas has never cared about Palestinian lives. https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/hamas_human_shields.pdf
And the whole room would have clapped
I can't even take a dude seriously that is wearing skinny jeans after 40.
I'm not sure who you're referring to as "we".
Weird way to misspell wife
It's a shot in the ass, anything less is just bluffing.
I'm not. At no point have I defended hamas.
The IDF keeps coming up with innovative ways to disgust us.  I didn't foresee them assaulting a man with Downs Syndrome, though.
Google "selection bias"
It probably makes sense that the same guys wearing an apartheid state's illegal Zionist settler flags need their dead bodies handed to their Zionist cult government.
I asked anyone and everyone involved legally and was told it didn't qualify because the act wasn't seen with my own eyes. I also got the "well this actually isn't an assault."
I was like, didn‚Äôt I just see this guy. Looks like different posters
Bunch of cowards who like to prey on people. Special place in hell for these scumbags
Palestine.
That would be rounds. No questions needed.
The western world is supporting what‚Äôs happening in gaza because they are ‚Äúdefending themselves‚Äù.Imagine if we were being bombed, food and water cut off, punished because of what a few politicians decided to do in other countries. It‚Äôs a lot different when you imagine yourself and your families being punished for the crimes of the government heads.
But the idf is like their official force taking orders directly from the government. Plus since Israel has mandatory service for becoming idf ur points is literally moot
‚ÄúTalked to him‚Äù good on them!
Stop defending genocidal war criminals

This has been proposed many times and Israel has agreed to it in the past. Hamas has always been the one to stop it. With no boogeyman Hamas looses power, its not in their interest to have a two state solution.
Let's just say he's now stalking the fishes, capeesh
By fully supporting Israel and letting them do what needs to be done so in the future they    wont have to be subjected to things like Hamas going on a murderous rampage just for terrors sake.
Isn't this old video? I swear I've seen this before
In the same way Hamas is not Palestine, Israel is not the IDF.
We compare today's anti-black blacks to yesterday's! Do you think anti-blackness among blacks started recently? There were house slaves who hated blacks then too. But you're wrong because you're wrong, not because of a faulty analogy.This guy is a Nazi because he wants to continue the ongoing extermination of Palestinians, a commonplace position to hold in the West today because Nazism is commonplace today.We have American school systems dedicated to worshipping Hitler, but they don't need to go that far to be Nazis, just like they didn't from 1910 to 1945

Support Isreal while they do their thing
yes you are correct we should start using 'Average American' instead. its more realistic
My brothers "talked to him"... good on them. Never underestimate the power of a good "conversation "
That is a disingenuous take and making analogy of nazi's to the people almost exterminated by them is immature at best.We don't compare African Americans who are racist to the slave owners in the south who literally OWNED their ancestors, we just say they are racist.The nazi's started a world War, tried to exterminate and entire race of people using gas chambers and starvation and attempted to warmonger the entirety of Europe.This guy is a just a bigoted asshole, grow up.
Sadly if you are dependent on having a simple dichotomy, Israel is the ‚Äògood‚Äô guy.
Legally she probably can't say but I bet dollars to donuts they "talked" with their fists. Fuckin' dude bailed to another country entirely.
What do you think a Nazi is? You do realize the original Nazis and their fascist brethren were around for decades prior to WW2, right? Like 20-30 years.
sometimes watching the screens aren't exciting enough anymore, and they start escalating like this...god knows what he's working up to next üëÄ
Sick f*ck is yanking it down, also. I hope OP' called the cops, and the guy gets consequences.
It's an old video but why the 'Misleading title' tag?
This dude is trouble waiting to happen. If this happened at my house when I was young, he would have been shot at, at the very least.
no one cares aside from other terrorist organizations...  no one.  we are tired of hamas - we are tired of terrorists.
But why?.. With all the porn content online at his disposable(live &amp; recorded).. He goes for the lowest of them all action.. Wow
Yes, but the army handled him well in spite of the provocation
No you idiot. I don‚Äôt like CCP. Miles Kwok is a scammer stealing money from people like you, naive. This dude is currently awaiting trial for FRAUD, Money Laundering, and a whole bunch of shit. The fact you come here posting this trash is hilarious.
Vile.
I don't mean this video in particular, I meant as a general example that a person with a mental disability should be treated differently. I don't care if he pelts you with stones or not, short of being in mortal danger, a mentally disabled person should simply be treated differently. Even sticking to the video this doesn't look okay in any context.
Where's the assault? What if they had good reason to move him? How else would you go about doing it?
It‚Äôs all good anyone who can give me a good explanation üòÇit was Audionix/inquizeX was a live stream with thousands of viewers
Interesting, but the ‚Äúpulverized pile of goo‚Äù was unnecessary.
He has not been beaten, Sir. They're holding him back! Don't take these propaganda titles as gospel truth.Think, why has the OP posted this video? OP is a terror enabler and a hamas propagandist
***Do you like Hamas?!?***
Deleted lol
I wonder why the attack ever happened considering what you said right after‚Ä¶Like‚Ä¶ it was a reactive attack, not unprovoked.
The more he freaks out the more existence of Palestine bothers him.
This is what they make rock salt shotgun shells for. Non lethal, but he'll wish they were.
Yeah those UNICEF boxes scattered all over the backs of the pickup trucks they used to run down people at the music festival. Might as well be wearing goose stompers and wearing green headbands while waving those blue boxesThose guys need an ass beating for sure

Couldn‚Äôt agree with you more. Assaulting the disabled should be given the same punishment as hurting children.
The Gestapos of the 21st century
This is more like you punch someone then they punch you, your kids, your wife and a few people who were minding there own business walking nearby.
There's two sides to this:1. Palestinians support hamas: then fuck them, you overwhelmingly voted for terrorism, and you're entering the "find out" phase2. Palestinians don't support hamas: then they've been oppressed by terrorists for over a decade, and honestly if you're freeing millions of hostages from a psychotic dictatorship, you can't really criticize the idf for using any means necessary to end the killing of civilians on both sides.
He's a hateful ignorant prick who needs a good ass whooping sure, but man this nazi comparison shit is getting so old. Not every hateful person is a Nazi.. It's a brainless take and was an order of magnitude worse than this shit at least.
If a mentally fit person pelts you with stones, I'm not going to excuse someone beating the living daylights out of them. But a mentally challenged person? C'mon. Sure, they can be perfectly capable of being goaded into misbehaving - or react completely out of line in a social situation, but these are fundamentally people with a *mental disability*, and that should warrant a different treatment.
Motherfucker is wanking to a 6yo?. Can‚Äôt say out loud what I think cuz it‚Äôs a hate crime.
Think its fair for them to gather money for innocent people in gaza. Hope hamas dont steal it once it get there tho. Palestines are starving but havent seen hamas starving
They found landing gear, an engine, and even semi intact luggage on the ground too including some passports of the terrorists.
They‚Äôve been fighting for thousands of years, let them continue to do so &amp; keep us out of it.
I have stopped giving Islamists any benefit of doubt. He must've pelted stone on the army, as is characteristic of these people. Will you be fine if a person with down syndrome commits assault against you because of your religion?He didn't write it but he's living it.
Fuck Zionism
Did you?
A year later on may 15th 1948 comes The Nakba, which all the Israelis refuse to a knowledge. Like right after the Nazis uproot a bunch of Jewish families from their home, they turn around and do the same thing to others, with just as much cruelty.
Absolute mad lad
Did the person with Down Syndrome... you know... write that?
This is Netanyahu's "democracy".Crush Hamas, stop the IDF! Free the Palestinians!

This is so sad. Meanwhile our gutless Western leaders are cheering for Israel like they always do. There is no difference between how pre teens swoon for their favorite Kpop band and how Western leaders queue up and bend over to show they are one of the cool kids by kissing Israeli politicians asses.
Need to go back and "talk" to him.
Such hate in these israelis. Wtf.
Ooof enjoy those downvotes, satisfying to see.
That‚Äôs what I want to know, too!
Hamas specifically targeted unarmed civilians. They also use Palestinian civilians as human shields &amp; launch their missiles from the apartment buildings now being knocked down. I agree with you that civilian casualties on both sides are horrible but there is a difference in that civilian casualties caused by Israeli bombs are collateral whereas Hamas very specifically targeted the civilians &amp; subjected them to unimaginable violence (murder, rape, torture, burned alive etc). &amp; The fact that Hamas specifically targeted civilians alone has evaporated much of the world‚Äôs sympathy for the plight of Palestinian civilians on the other side &amp; Israel responses that would‚Äôve otherwise been met w/ international condemnation a couple weeks earlier are now viewed as completely reasonable considering the context of how despicable &amp; inhumane Hamas‚Äôs actions were. Unfortunately it‚Äôs the Palestinian civilians that will pay the highest price &amp; it‚Äôs really Hamas‚Äôs fault when it comes down to it. They opened the gates of hell.
Do they talk to him or did they TALK to him?
Glad you got family that could step in...

That‚Äôs why I think Israel is pausing. They could get entangled into a quagmire messing up peace agreements with other countries. Hamas is ready for the attack. It could be like Iwo Jima
Wow, very Nazi-esque. Calm down, you nightmarish skin tag.
How did he not land on a sexual offender list? Sorry that happened to you, that‚Äôs beyond creepy.
Put pressure on politicians to keep working with Israel and Egypt to support humanitarian corridors out of the Gaza Strip and to set up refuge camps. Provide funding for supplies at refuge camps if/when they are established.Stand up against racism and hate. The things that Hamas did were super horrible, but that doesn't mean all Palestinians (or Muslims) are bad.I am afraid that the possible long term solutions are not politically feasible.
According to the biblical narrative, the Amalekites were a nomadic tribe that had attacked the Israelites during their journey in the wilderness after their escape from Egypt. In Exodus 17:8-16, the Amalekites fought against the Israelites in a battle at Rephidim. As a result, God declared a lasting enmity toward the Amalekites and vowed to blot out their memory from under heaven. The commandment in 1 Samuel 15 to attack the Amalekites and destroy everything they had can be seen as a fulfillment of this earlier declaration. However, it's important to understand that religious texts should be interpreted within their historical and cultural context, and this passage reflects the beliefs and actions of that time.
I think sadly the best thing is to let israel and Palestine do its thing. The crisis will continue as long as Hamas has a choice to continue. You can't make peace with someone who don't want peace. You have to make both sides want peace. One way or another.

Wait what
Zionists are like Nazis
See, this is why I don't fully get the "I stand by Israel " thing I hear people say. I mean I get that they were attacked but all I'm seeing is assaults on Palestinian citizens who haven't done anything wrong.

But I‚Äôm also a skeptic and I‚Äôm thinking they wanted to divert the attention away from the fact the billion of $ sent to prop Gaza up and try to make it like Monaco (ish) were funneled off to build tunnels and buy weapons by Hamas.   Either way‚Ä¶the main stream media is largely to blame for much of the world‚Äôs division these days.  Especially in the US.  Just my humble opinion.   Few in Washington really care about the common person.  Just lining their pockets.
Palestine. Now what?
One could say that is in fact NOT a fan
People with DS are literally sunshine and rainbows personified on earth. I found this incredibly hard to watch. Poor dude. Wish I could give him a massive hug. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Palestine aint the terrorists, Hamas on the other hand.
Palestine du fromage
Not true
I wonder if he gets an extra virgin too.
I understood what you were saying,  and you were right.
He feigns ignorance in order to allow his guests to develop their points. It's an interview strategy.
Truth is we‚Äôre going to have to wait for another 100,000 dead children before the political climate allows the government to put pressure on Israel to not do a genocide. Evangelical christians here in the states believes the the end times will begin when all of Israel is occupied by Jews, which is something they want. Evangelicals are a huge voting block, and of course Zionist Jews are also a huge voting block. Even though I‚Äôm not religious, all we can do right now is prey.

It‚Äôs assault, brother. The dude kicked, pushed and headbutted them.
There is no "turn", this has been daily life for Palestinians for decades.
so they're both just as bad? that doesn't help either of our argumentsthere's also videos of israeli settlers shooting palestinians in front of idf for no reason and the idf ignoring itboth of them are pretty terrible so i don't think we're gonna out-warcrime eachother anyway
Yes, he threw a nuke he made in his house
I would have said Palestine one more time
Weird you would post a link that says otherwise.&gt;We got very very disturbing reports that came from the ground that there were babies that had been beheaded‚Ä¶ I think we can now say with relative confidence that unfortunately this is what happened in Be‚Äôeri,‚Äù he said.The 'factcheck' link only argues that it was probably not 40 babies "beheaded".&gt;In one clip, she said ‚Äúabout 40 babies at least,‚Äù who were dead, according to a commander, ‚Äúwere taken out on gurneys.‚Äù In another clip, she said babies had ‚Äútheir heads cut off, they said‚Äù ‚Äì but she never mentioned a number. &gt;The claim about ‚Äú40 babies beheaded‚Äù appears to be a combination of those two separate details that Zedeck relayed during the live broadcasts.There's still 40 dead babies at the hands of Hamas. ^edit: at one location FFS You ride an ugly high horse.
But the Israeli government doesn't accuse random Gazan citizens who are not terrorists of being terrorists... Hamas are the terrorists, and they also terrorize the innocent citizens of Gaza (stealing aid, preventing evacuations, etc.)
Lmao you know there‚Äôs literal videos of Palestinians using children‚Äôs as shields and pushing them towards idf soldiers telling them to throw rocks at them right? Where‚Äôs the videos of hamas using children‚Äôs as shields? I‚Äôll wait.
Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right my friend. Also not all Palestinians are in Hamas
Yes the American government has committed war crimes. And this is a post about how civilians could influence the government to stop war crimes. Duh
Why would Allah give him DS? üò°
Savage headbutts.
What about the IDF terrorists who have been oppressing and murdering Palestinians for 75 years? That part is always conveniently forgotten about
I thought ‚Äòoh that‚Äôs comforting for the families‚Äô and then he said ‚Äòpulverized‚Äô and ‚Äòpile of goo‚Äô üòÇ
Hate crime
I see they did not cut off his head, kill him or burn his body with his family members. I don't see a drop of blood and after the situation was cleared up, everyone went about their business. Now that's the difference between the two sides.
Fuck you, you dont know me or anything about me. Have you been colonized?? I have. I have faced so much generational trauma, most of my cousins and many of my friends are dead from trauma and after effects of residential schools has had on my people. Fuck you, you don't know anything. You don't face daily discrimination for being indigenous do you?? Have you ever walked into a store and have the white workers follow you and profile you because you're indigenous ?? I don't think so. Have you ever been pulled over by the cops and told to do a breathalyzer test because I look shady for being indigenous. It happened a lot, even my white friends thought I was being overly targeted. I've gone through so much man, you can't compare me to a soldier. Soldiers follow orders and do as you are told, I'm just trying to live my life man. I am against violence and horrific acts against innocents. I bet you haven't been relocated by the government or told your language is the devil's tongue have you??? I have , my people went through that.
Nothing to do with Israel/Gaza I bet really.  Guys like this are just looking for a fight. Probably does the same thing when anti abortion or pro cycle lane people are in town.
In the Middle-East, yes Israel is the good guy for sure.
Incoming bot comments to help Mossad continue genocide while the world watches and chooses a side. IDF are SS at this point using Mossads terror group Hamas as a scapegoat. Disgusting. Funny how the Israeli civil war pretty much vanished and any Israelis coming out against the current regime are getting IDF treatment. Hope the honest civilians on both sides make it out but genocide is so mainstream these days it‚Äôs looking grim. I stand with the PEOPLE and not the radical extremist groups/governments found on both sides.
The beheaded babies claim is untrue but they did behead people.If you don't believe this , Dm me.
Well it is Reddit, anything is possible.
This is parody
Why do all these Israelis want to f*** you in the a$$ when they are arguing with you?
Right where? Looks like he got a hug and a ride to the hospital to me.
It was right there, but you can only see it if you are fucking human.
Yes, you are a stupid ass internet person. Glad you know it at least.
Yeah that disabled kid has no morals! That is what the soldiers think that are trying to kill him. You are just like those soldiers.
I get you want context. You are being downvoted for being a fucking idiot. The context is clear as fucking day you twat.
You need to say it the way Dexter says "Omelette du Fromage" in his ear.
Can I get a time stamp on there the ‚ÄúViolent assault‚Äù takes place?
Someone said, on another post of this, it was in Milan.I was in Milan late August/early September and there were UNICEF volunteers in some spots we walked through.
The Hamas terrorists who carried out the attack were carrying Unicef first aid kits. This may have something to do with that.  Theres no excuse for bad behavior, but it is worth knowing thats where these donations end up.
looks like idf was taking a break from using children as human shields and arresting them and raping them
This happened a few years ago. If I remember correctly, didn't the guy with down syndrome throw something at a solider?
its been like this in palestine for years
Look.If it was a peaceful treaty back in 1948, Israel wouldn't need USA to be their body guard.It was a dirty ass deal and shit gonna go down.I'm not for anyone getting killed but there's never been a time that food, water, medicine, and electricity was cut off to a population because some thugs decided to attack.This is going to breed the most violent murderers.
Nazi level hatred. Pretty ironic.
AliExpress order
The guy is a POS but if you think these aids go the right people there (innocent civilians with bombed homes etc) you are mistaken, whether it goes through Israel or Hamas. They just won‚Äôt see the money especially in this situation.
HOW many headbutts did he fail at?
Some folks have lost their jobs for being recorded while acting this way. Hope that happens to thus guy. And charged with assault for the head butts and kick.
I remember so vividly watching that  that I didn't even need to reed the full first sentence to know exactly what you're referring to.But I don't believe anyone would survive the impact, let alone the fall to the ground. Even the bodies of jumpers became completely disfigured on impact (there's a recent account of that by firefighters, including friends of the first one to die that day (being hit by a jumper).  I find it more likely it was a ground level bystander that was hit by debris from the explosion.
I think he's trying to be sarcastic
What's with the headbutts everywhere outside the US? I mean it seems to work. Just funny you rarely ever see it in videos of physical altercations here but much more often anywhere else.
Well some of you did. Most of the world has known for years.
it was supposed to be a joke but I guess people really think someone would hate the above.  Ah well.
But this video doesn‚Äôt show Hamas. There‚Äôs no both sides here. Just occupation forces harassing civilians.
Thats fucking harassment, piece of shit person
Ah, of course, he's a combatant
He isn't even beaten in the video. What probably happened is he at least threatened, at most attacked a soldier and they had to defend themselves
Were the tourists on the festival morally wrong? OP above you was referencing to actual bad people, not innocent civilians on both sides.
No , the isreali army/govt and hamas. The leaders in charge and the leaders who led and lied to the people about being just and right for them. Israelis have tried multiple times to oust Mr. Ben. He barely hangs on each time. And they let Hamas grow and flourish. The Palestinians were lied to when they elected Hamas. Hamas is a puppet for the real power players, those in charge further out east
Starting to realize that entire generation is that way around most the world. Really bad in the West.Many of them think the younger generations still live under their roof. They can scream and yell and abuse younger people all they want and we automatically have to do what they tell us to. It's just painfully obvious at this point that they've lost control of the world around them and are just spiraling downhill in anger because they have no control.
What context would excuse the beating of an intellectually disabled person
Redditor calls entire ethno-national group terrorists, in response to criticism of Israeli soldiers conduct.My, aren't you strong and brave.
"Pulverized pile of goo"? What an arrogant, insensitive asshole.
The disabled man is horribly morally wrong?
All of this is taking a very bad and dangerous turn..
Advocate for a two state solution that stops the blood shedding on both sides. Take a pro Israel or Palestine solution leads to conflict like this. For those on both sides saying things will be better with out the other. You have lost your soul. Blood loss leads to death.
Palestine Palestine Palestine, you garbage of a human
Why hurt the disabled?? Both sides I think no longer can state they have morals. Both sides are horribly morally wrong in all of this. No one will win this. Everyone will lose
I think the issue is that the civilians are the ground from which the Hamas seed sprung out of‚Ä¶.and as they say: you are judged by the company you keep
Okay??
Israel = Apartheid IDF = Genocide Zionism = Cancer
Its crazy how a population can be brainwashed into thinking that one group of people is the cause of all their wrongs, and then proceed to label them as sub-human, terrorists, and simply mark them for extermination.Said the Jew in the concentration camp
Only one aggressor there
How convenient that the video doesn't show any context
Putin won't do anything.
These racist fucks make my blood boil
Hamas is a society of violent people, supported by the Palestinian government!!! That‚Äôs the end of the story. The government would rather differ money from good causes, such as healthcare hospitals and education towards building, rockets and secret tunnels etc. Supporting this government means you are supporting Hamas.If you wanna get into the history of it, the Palestinian people (which is the name that‚Äôs only been around for about 200 years, before that, philistines, before that, they were know as sea people) right after receiving land in 1947, under the condition of having to share it with the Jewish people. Since 1917, when the British took over after the ottoman empire, that was the plan to give these people that lived in  Palestinian, some land under the condition that they allow Jewish people on the same land. Since the Jews have been there, just as long as these newly declared, Palestinians. These Palestinians, which are so peaceful, decide to start a Civil War. Within months of achieving their goal in Palestinian declare war on the Israelis and enlist 28 other Arab nations to support them in their goals of removing the Jews from the Jewish peoples lands. Keep in mind the British gave it to both and without the British giving land to the Jews, the Palestinians would‚Äôve gotten nothing at the time. This is all very clearly spelled out between 1917 and 1919. Back to 1947/8 the Arab nations failed. To repeat the Arab nations failed. One and a half million Palestinians were beaten by the Jewish forces, which would received supported by the US France and Britain. The consequence of the Palestinians, aggressive and stupid action was that they were pushed off the land, which the Jewish had now won from them, why?? Because Palestinian declared war on them. That is the end of the Palestinian rights to those lands. Unfortunately, even though you feel differently, the facts of history will always remain and be unchanged.War is never a good thing. But removing aggressive societies like this is. You must be a supporter of Hamas. You also must be a supporter of sharia law and totalitarian governments. I highly urge you to go join the fight. Fight along the side your hamas friends which you support‚Ä¶ And I shall pray you never returned and suffer a slow and painful death. Enjoy you‚Äôre travels!
Yeah I‚Äôve seen this before
Neutral is the coward's way to not side with the oppressed.
I see someone terrorizing others who are only defending themselves. Israel turned their backs on peace years ago. God is sad.

Bro don't lie those were Israelis attacking an Israeli father
![gif](giphy|vFrboE9LU5Twtl7lRe|downsized)
I guess in Hebrew ‚ÄúI‚ÄôLL F*CK YOU IN THE ASS‚Äù is a monster of an insult and NOT a PICK up line to a leather bottom.
Those are not rockets
No fucking thoughts in that brain, just one very hateful brain cell working overtime.
Yeah and i am not denying that at all but they are now doing the same thing to the Palestinians. And this should not be ignored or justified no matter what
You'll come to learn that sometimes the people who control how you learn history will tell you someone is the bad guy when he was actually 100% correct. You'll learn buddy.
I don‚Äôt disagree with you that both sides have at times crossed the line, but the having previous home owner comment seemed dismissive of all Jewish history on the land pre-1946. The Jews didn‚Äôt just show up in centuries later in 1946 saying they want their ‚Äúgreat great grandfather‚Äôs‚Äù land back. They were always there and many have been kicked off their land time and time again by different powers, one bring the Ottoman Empire during WWI.

Uneducated low minded POS on a stick
Fucking psychopath.
I am going to treat this as if you are speaking in good faith and just explain why it works as an analogy:She is accusing random islamic citizens who are not terrorists of being terrorists, similar to how the Israeli government is blaming random gazan citizens who are not terrorists of being terrorists.
I would have walked up to him, prepared myself, and fucking said Palestine one more time.
Lock him up and throw they key away
Then they are in the wrong as well.
The Palestinians didn't allow then out of the kindness of their own heart. The UN practically forced it.

https://youtu.be/7FhkgnCVUnI?si=K7jsR3xpF9PZNCDH
Just saw another video of Palestinians attacking an Israeli father whose daughter got kidnapped while screaming they hope his daughter dies.
So we see Down syndrome Palestinians getting dragged out of residences during a time when they ARE getting kicked out of their homes and the first thing you ask is ‚Äúis it true‚Äù üíÄüò≠ how far from the truth can it be if it‚Äôs REALLY happening?? And it‚Äôs documented as such for the past 5 decades??
All that shows, though, is how long it has been acceptable to hate Palestine. People love to say this conflict started on 7 Oct with Hamas, but they're wrong. This is for UNICEF -- for children. But aid to Palestinian kids is even too much for people to handle :(
The British empire colonised them , it is  not theirs. Before the jew came , who used to live there ,Palestinians , what right they had to claim their homes and kick them out ?
No you didn‚Äôt. Have you always been a fool?
I just pointed out how dishonest you are. Move along.
Nice sentence?? Was that what you attempted to do?
I never dismissed that the Jews used to live in that land and i said it in another comment, i honestly don't have the historical information why they didn't live there anymore. But what i know that by 1946 the Palestines were living , and i know that they weren't the ones who kicked the jews out of their land.What i am against in this situation that both parties want to claim the land the isreal just want to kick the Palestines out and the Palestinians want to kick isreal out.Which is wrong in both ways .Isreal is always talking about the injustice the suffered from the Nazi and now they are doing the same thing for the Palestinians
Nice bad faith arguing!
I meant in terms of land because you seemed to dismiss the fact that the Jews owned the land first and compared it to selling a house. So I was just curious if you thought the indigenous losing their land was the same as previous owners living in your house.
True
This was pretty old right? Before the recent conflict I'm pretty sure
I'm sorry but didn't Hamas do just that? No one is going to feel bad about the Palestinians and what is going to happen in Gaza. They raped women, butchered children, and showed no mercy. Why do you think the IDF would respond any differently?
Palestine is like the n word for jews lol
Angry **w
"Did no evil" you are deluded
US supplies Israel
The mental torture they put him through is assault in itself.
Irrational bully.
You are literally bottom of the barrel in the way that you think
Iran‚Äôs support for Hamas has created suspicion it‚Äôs wrecking Israel-Saudi deal. The idea is that all Arab nations will finally become allies with Israel, bringing peace to the previously tumultuous region. But it would also form a kind-of mini-NATO in the region. Weakening Iran's position, and ability to fund Hamas, Hezbollah and other militias in the region.
Especially being trapped and unable to do anything about it. Even if your running from something that‚Äôs going to kill you, at least you have the illusion that your in control in order to be safe or some very small probability. With a plane your screwed. Sounds weird but for me it‚Äôs like a claustrophobic thing. Being stuck.Drowning I‚Äôm sure would feel similar in some weird way I‚Äôd assume.
Please tell me what happened.

How is this an analogy for a 1,000 terrorists storming a music festival and civilian towns, slaughtering children, women and men, while kidnapping other children, women and men? I mean, don't get me wrong, I'm Israeli and I'm against saying stupid things like "All Muslims are terrorists". But I don't get how this is an analogy for anything that has happened...

Than the people either should accept violence from both parties and not to make any excuses for any one of them . If people say that the isreal government have the right to do this than they have no right to blame hamas because they both fighting for their rights. If you want to justify this violence justify it in both cases . Even when this concept is totally wrong
Of course i do , how can't i ?The horrible things that happened there , the Europeans had no right for their actions, for the massacres they did.And even if it was many years ago no one should forget it and how the Europeans are just murderers.I will always belief that no one deserves to live in fear or deserves to get kicked out from their lands .But it seems like history just keep repeating itself over and over again , without us as humans learning from it .In the 16th century the Aztec Empire suffered from the Spanish conquest , in the 18th century the Americans Indians and the Europeans.the cycle will never end like this   .
It's difficult to believe he's as stupid as he portrays himself to be.
I feel like Russia has always been doing their own thing, they did help win the war against Germany
At this point be skeptical  with every piece of shit news that comes out..especially from sympathizer who are not even there..
No.
Do you live there? If not and your saying this for nothing. It sucks that hamas ruined it for your people.
If there so dead set on freeing Palestine please get on a plane and go save it.
You can't make change without harming someone. Especially when government had some alternative agenda.
Aljezeera is a terrorist supporting new souce. It's not a trustworthy news source. I prefer independent news. souces.

They fucked around, now their finding out.
I remember seeing this as a kid.. safe to say I didn‚Äôt like this commercial
Yes and soo have they but actual war games sir
They pretty much side with them because they were to weak or not well equipped at that point I‚Äôd probably do my best to leave country rather than be caught in the crossfire of a suicidal group
And that‚Äôs my point, if you are a true believer in the betterment of that country they would have kicked Hamas out.
The civilian should have rose up against Hamas they did not so they are just as responsible point blank period
Count all the rockets hamas fired at isreal last 20 years
Free my butthole üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà
I think they did it because Saudi was close to recognizing Israel as a state, this set that back. They will sacrifice the lives of all the Palestinian people to make it so that never happens.  They don't care about Palestine it's a pawn to them, a recruitment center.  If Israel attacks afterwards it doesn't impact them. The leaders are not in Palestine.
Did you miss the 1000 videos of the Palestinian civilians cheering them in and spitting on naked corpses being paraded around gas city. That corse was a female not even in her 20‚Äôs. Fuck hamas and the Palestinians that hide them.
It isn't, but not many people will cry for them. Or stand up to save them.  As it is painfully obvious they wouldn't do it for them.  Even Egypt won't let them in.
There can never be a justification for killing innocent women and children.
Most people believe that they allowed Hamas to grow safely within their country and celebrated their attack.  Right wing or not the actions afterwards speak for themselves.
Hopefully, I only know a few counties counts that were published. It seems yes it's blamed on Hamas that runs Palestine, plus they celebrated it. Soooo ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è hard to shed a tear.
ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è well they supported Hamas, cheered for other terror attacks on other countries, now cry when it comes home. Seems like it's their chickens coming home. There were sympathies for Palestine before this. Not alot out there now adays
This makes me sick
Hamas and Palestine have two different interests. Just as a fringe segment of a political party may have a loud minority viewpoint the same can be said here. What I really wonder is why would civilians have to be made to pay for the sins of a terrorist group? You cannot make civilians pay for crimes they did not commit.

Then take yourself to see Come From Away, the musical about the diversion to Gander. It is funny, uplifting, occasionally sad, but mostly a wonderful and much-needed treatment of the subject.
I had not heard of that transcript.  Thank you for adding that clarity.
Maybe Hamas shouldn't have gone on a murderous rampage just for terrors sake....
Just to be clear: He knows his astrophysics, but he is very far from an expert when it comes to most other things. And he *loves* to talk out of his ass and sound deep and meaningful, even though he's wrong constantly when he's talking about other things.His twitter account is banned from /r/iamverysmart because he constantly post "deep" bullshit that isn't true.
It's the same reason they're spreading false narratives about unimaginable atrocities. It's the easiest way to make otherwise civilised people feel justified and righteous in attacking before questioning. Because why would anyone negotiate with baby killing nazis.. just bomb the nazis entire village. The Russians have been doing it for literally decades, but their fuck ups are just highlighting Israels even further.
You‚Äôve clearly never drowned.
This is very sweet and the greatest form of humanity one can show someone is to let them into our home. Palestinians did the right, holy, and human thing. They are now paying dearly for their kindness. Their children and women and innocents are being slaughtered because a terrorist group killed innocents. Why are we punishing those who did no evil for the evil of cowards?
I did see them ununiformed during videos of their attacks. Hence, you are correct in that they do not wear uniform. Would you mind letting me know what your thoughts are on how else we could figure out who Hamas is Vs. innocent Palestinian civilians? What would be our method or strategy. I hypothesize that this could save countless lives rather than blanket murder of a People(s) in hopes of eradicating the terrorists.
I tried to use words but maybe a link from above best answers your questions https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XNf40sBcvKk
*points to sewer rat* Is this terrorism?THIS IS TERRORIST.*points to banana peel next to trashcan* and this?THIS IS TERRORIST.*holds mirror to her face* ....THIS IS TERRORIST.
Do you truly believe that the Palestine population is Hamas or that Hamas is an fringe extremist group?
Tell Hamas how mad they are!! Lol
So Hamas has a trained Arny with uniforms?  The civilians are Hamas. They're forcing the innocent people to stay there. Only way to end this is to level northern Gaza.
These arguments are an appeal to challenge our ideology on humanity. For many this level of violence is acceptable just as long the narrative makes sense.Ukraine being erased from the map is an atrocity but our leaders are not able to say the same about Palestine being erased from the map. It is the double standard that is tiring.To equivocate Hamas with Palestines is to equivocate Taliban with Afghanis. Equivocating extremists with the center isn‚Äôt fair, just or smart. It is outright dangerous, all the while desensitizing us to approve murder of innocents and civilians.
Just blamed on HAMAS? It's not being blamed on HAMAS, HAMAS has come out and said they did it. You can search and see how many civilians of any country have died. It may increase as the remaining bodies are identified but it isn't being kept a secret. Plus they don't know who all has been taken hostage because many of the hostages are also duel citizens. HAMAS attacked Isreal and if they didn't expect for this outcome they are not very intelligent.
Do you believe in your heart that murdering women and children (innocent civilians) will make it better that a terrorist organization killed innocent civilians? These civilians are innocent and did not attack anyone yet they paid the highest price one can pay and that is with your life! How is justice working its wheels of righteousness here?
So if I punch you in the face and you punch me back 2 times.   Are you upset at yourself for it?
big planes had pay phones on the backs of the seats
Then why are we killing more civilians? How does this get us to our goal of safety? How does leveling apartment buildings with women and children make anyone safer?
Very true. I feel like this is our holocaust. I am certain that many during the holocaust turned a blind eye and did  not challenge the murder of innocent civilians.
I truly do hope they choose to be transparent regarding that information. This is all very sad.
Exactly! We will never forget 30 dead Americans. When Israel is finished, then the USA will get our turn to destroy the evil doers. I can‚Äôt listen to people who weaponize humanitarian aid.
Just out of curiosity, do you have the same belief with respect to the Indigenous population in North America?
Antifa in Palestinian swag one day and maga on another. Anything to cause violence. These people need to get a life.
Gaza would be a great place to start a foundation leveling business.
So I guess your point is that you‚Äôre okay with the Jewish people being killed in the millions? This is war! Stop looking if you can‚Äôt take reality. I‚Äôm not okay with any of it!!!!
Exactly i am totally against hamas and never and will never say that i am with them or justify their actions.But i just want people to see that even isreal government is as evil as hamas and stop the hypocrisy.Both countries have the right to exist isreal and Palestine none of them is lesser than the other.Both citizens deserve peace.
this is terrorism this is terrorism this is terrorism this is terrorism this is terrorism this is terrorismPropaganda brain rot
How many of the killed and injured were other nationalities? Will they even release that data? Will it just be blamed on Hamas?
I was gonna say something but the state sponsored bot farm downvote bots will get me if I do‚Ä¶
You can be against Israel policy and still not support Hamas and their actions.I am a supporter of Israel but even I have to admit some of their actions in the West Bank give me pause. And especially Area B in the West Bank really can‚Äôt prosper (you can make an argument for area A as well). At the end of the day there is no real solution because both want the same land, and neither really have claim to it other then who won the previous wars. Israel has a right to exist and defend itself in my opinion, I just hope they minimize civilian casualties as much as possible, unfortunately Hamas‚Äô strategy is an impediment to that.
Suicide mission?
Shut the hell up u white fuck if u don‚Äôt know the truth stfu
In your expertise what should have been Israelis response then?
Jewish bot: I understand .. I understand .. I understand
That's an excellent qualification for a pilot, imo lol
I imagine nearly every person on a plane at that time probably were terrified they were next until they touched down where they were supposed to be- or at least touchdown safe.
**Definitely** don‚Äôt look up what the people on [TWA 800](https://admiralcloudberg.medium.com/memories-of-flame-the-crash-of-twa-flight-800-fecfd651a157) would have experienced‚Ä¶
I realized years ago NDT is a pompous douchebag who loves the smell of his own farts and the sound of his own voice. Life improved once I saw he's a fucking windbag grifter
Society of violent people? The children? You have literally no idea what you're even talking about. Hamas is not even based in the West Bank.  You can wish and pray whatever you want, you're petty and uneducated and talk out of turn when you should be listening, and in the end looking stupid in comments is about all you'll ever end up doing.
Glad to see it worked so well for them
You‚Äôre right‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs no wall around gazaüôÑ don‚Äôt know what I was thinking‚Ä¶ must have dreamt it
They absolutely knew because they could see the burning north tower out of the left side when it banked towards the city.
Large body aircraft used to have [seatback phones](https://simpleflying.com/widebody-aircraft-seatback-phones/) in them.
with the two flights that hit the towers? got a link?
Sooo‚Ä¶ that means the idf shot the bad guys without guns‚Ä¶ then Found   the guns‚Ä¶ so they guessed right
they knew something was wrong though because they had already started an emergency ascent to the surface. they probably heard the cracking etc. but they were too late.
its funny how everyone calls their enemy either a terrorist or a nazi
Planes used to have pay phones. Some passengers used them to call loved ones and were informed about what happened to the other planes.
Humans are really good at holding on to slivers of hope
I was quite obviously referencing the germanic tribes (boy) fighting the Romans (dog).
Who do you think is the boy and who is the dog in this situation ? Would you please verify
"I just don't get it, why does that mean dog keep biting that poor boy every time he kicks him in the balls? The boy obviously isn't learning not to keep doing it, so why does the dog keep attacking?"
He forgets the terror of the anticipation the entire time after the hijacking occurred
It is not a one year story or two or three this thing was going for more than decades if they really cared they will have found a solution .Palestine didn't just suffer this year and you know it . If they cared like you said why they didn't take any actions. Growing up they always told us that the Palestinians deserved everything.It's been years and years and all of this happening . Even if this didn't happen the Palestinians will just keep suffering.Even isreal is playing the victim here it is not like they are angels they did the same horrible things .I will always stand by this both are in the wrong and the civilians don't deserve it no matter what. What makes you lose your support for Palestinians when they are going through hell for decades just for hamas action and not losing your support for Israel for doing horrible things for decades?
Because you get called an antisemite and a Hamas supporter or a naive leftist.So it‚Äôs easier to just let them have this genocide.
They did in 2018 during the land day the Palestinians were protesting and the isreal forces opened fire on them 16 Palestines were shot dead. If you look up you will see how many Palestine were forced out of their homes.And the isreal forces this year 2023 forced them to get out of the Aqsa mosque when they were praying . You can look it up and you will see videos how they are kicking them when they were praying.As i said they are bot equally evil and both should be punished for their crimes and what they put their citizens through.
They were in cell phone communication with people on the ground who told them, so no need to guess.
So far they didn't lie about the retribution, they said it would be rough.  It causes more outrage because of how it was done, all countries have civilians killed due to that attack.  I would not expect any sympathy.  Plus let's be honest... They tend to celebrate anytime an attack hits the west. Soooo yeah I wouldn't expect anyone to honestly care anymore when you act like that.
Hell is the time before you know you are going to die
your wrong people do care. i did.  look at all the support with the killings.  just think if that day never happened how many more people would support Palestine I totally understand where your coming from, It would irate me seeing a Arab family getting thrown out of a house that was in their family for decades. The killings and the fashion it was done in is way over the top. to do that and play the victim is cowardly.
üòà
I need a comfort blanket after reading this.
you always count on a white women for spreading love.
I'm sure thats comforting to the families
Great, so another one to make me cry. I just added them to my list though, excited to read something new. Thank you!
Nazis
Israel never once woke up one day  and ran a muck killing unarmed people and taking innocent hostages for no reason.  How many Allah holidays  has Israel paraglided in on a party knowing people were enjoying themselves and were soft targets?  The actions  of Hamas and the reaction from the people of Palestine have given Israel a green light to come in and shoot anything that moves. Because that's what happened to them.
There *may* have been a person who survived the plane long enough to be conscious on the ground.[Ernest Armstead was an emergency medical specialist who responded on that day and this is his account.](https://www.deuceofclubs.com/books/160_sep11.htm)&gt; I think of her as the living dead. I talked to the living dead. And I lied to the living dead. I told her to hang on, that help was coming. But I pronounced her dead in my mind. And she knew that. I put a black tag with a small white cross around her neck. And as best she could, she gave me hell for it. The psychiatrists and those from the post-trauma team say it is good for me to talk about her and the rest of that day. They say it is the only way I will come to terms with what happened and finally free my mind of her. So here I am talking to you.&gt; This lady was among a half-dozen people I saw who probably fell a thousand feet or so when American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into the World Trade Center. I am not sure how she got on the plaza. Maybe she was on her way to Los Angeles and was ejected from the jet by the force of the collision. Or maybe she was an office worker in the tower sitting near one of the windows and she was swept away when the building caved around her. Or maybe she was trapped and jumped to escape the flames, though I don't think so. I happened upon her even before most of those people were seen jumping.&gt; She was an elegant lady. About my age, early fifties. I could see that even with all that she had been through. I could tell that she had her hair done up very nicely. Brunette. She had on tasteful earrings. She was wearing pretty makeup. And in my profession you notice clothes because so often you have to cut them into pieces to save lives. That was the first thing that came to mind: This lady is well dressed....&gt; Triage is the first thing that should be done at a disaster like this. It basically means dividing the injured into four categories so that backup medical teams can move quickly in and give treatment to those who need it most urgently. The categories are indicated by colored tags that are hung around the injured person's neck. Green is the least serious. Yellow more so. Red indicates critical injuries. And black means the person is dead or close to it. When you're engaged in triage, you have one thing in the back of your mind all of the time, My backup is coming. My backup is coming. That's the reason you can tag people who obviously need help and not stop and give it to them right then. You know you need to get everyone tagged, and you know that someone with a medical bag is coming right behind you.&gt; That certainly is what I was thinking when I met the lady in the plaza, the big open space between the two towers that had a fountain ad a round sculpture in the middle. I had finished tagging everyone from the stairwells, when I turned to face the plaza. I had not noticed the people there on my way upstairs because I was in such a hurry and there was such a crowd of firefighters blocking my view out the window. But now I saw something that was so horrific that I am glad I missed it the first time around. When the plane hit, an incredible amount of debris from the collision rained down on the plaza. Most of it was chunks of airplane and building that had little meaning to me. But amid the destruction, there were a half dozen or so people, I ran toward them, my triage tags in hand. There was a man having a seizure and his eyes were rolling into the back of his head. He had struck the pavement so hard that there was virtually nothing else left of him. There were a couple others that I never got to, but I could see from a short distance that they were dead. And then there was the lady with the nice hairdo and earrings.&gt; When I got to her, I ripped out a black tag. What impressed me -- and scared me -- was that she was alert and was watching what I was doing. I put the tag around her neck and she looked at me and said, "I am not dead. Call my daughter. I am not dead." I was so startled that for a split second I was speechless. "Ma'am," I said, "don't worry about it. We will be right back to you." That was a lie. She couldn't see what I could see. Somehow, I guess it was an air draft or something, her fall had been cushioned enough so that she didn't splatter like the others. Still her body was so twisted and torn apart that I could only ask myself, Why is this lady still alive and talking to me? How can this be? Her right lung, shoulder and head were intact, but from the diaphragm down she was unrecognizable. Yet she was lucid enough that she continued to argue with me. "I am not dead," she insisted again. I am convinced she had some medical training because she knew I had given her the black mark of death. And she resented it. "Don't worry about what I put around your neck," I told her. "My coworkers are coming right now. They're going to take care of you."&gt; I knew I had to keep going, but she had so deeply shaken me that I lingered for a second or two. Then I stepped over her to get to the others. I put a black tag on the man having the seizure. But another wave of casualties arrived in the lobby from upstairs, so I needed to return. As I headed back, I stepped over the lady one more time. And as eerie and unsettling as our first encounter had been, the second was even worse. She started yelling at me.&gt; "I am not dead! I am not dead!"&gt; "They're coming, they're coming," I replied without stopping.&gt; "I am not dead! I am not dead!"&gt; I went back to the lobby, putting her out of my mind for now. There was so much that needed to be done. I began tagging the hundreds of people coming out of the building....&gt; I can honestly say that I didn't fear death, though I walked for hours in a wretched place I can only describe with a biblical reference -- "the valley of the shadow of death." I felt death, I heard it, I saw it and I smelled it. And with that lady in the plaza, I even talked to it. That story always stuck with me.
Terrorist attack by Hamas kills 1300 civilians. Isreal responds by killing 2808 Palestinian civilians and wounding more than 10,859 Palestinian civilians. Many of the wounded civilians may not survive their injuries due to lack of access to adequate medical care  hospitals are overrun, lacking their resources needing to be effective, lacking electricity and water necessary for survival.Why does the terrorist attack against 1300 non Palestinian civilians cause more outrage than an attack against 2808 Palestinian civilians wounding over 10,000 half of which may succumb to their injuries.
Hamas doesn't represent the Palestinians and i am still and will always be against them.But to say that if the Palestinians need to learn to negotiate and show the world the horrible things they suffered is kinda ridicules i am sorry because they did for years and years but no one cared . They tried to negotiate but no one cared . For years isreal treated the  Palestinians as shit and no one talked ,it is not like it was a secret and no one knew.They all knew what the Palestinians were going through .But did you see anyone taking actions even the Arabic countries that they pretend to care didn't do anything.You are blaming hamas for killing kids and i 100% with you but the isreal government did the same over the years so deserves the blame too.Both of them are equally horrible .And both citizens are suffering from their choices .Both should be blamed not only hamas .Because if i go with you argument and the way you put it . I can say that isreal government is responsible for her citizens death with the injustice they have done to the Palestinians. Same as hamas is responsible now for the Palestinians suffers.
Wish rockets
If it comes from China, they'll be lucky if it makes it off the ground, but good try anways....
They way you describe everyone of your videos is, You are trying to get pity from everyone. My Question to you, If they are so innocent, why is it thousands of them will hold major celebrations in the street when a Jews or Christians are Killed????? They ALL chant, "Death the Israel, Death to America"
faster than nerve signals travel, so faster than able to feel any pain, or even notice that anything happened. just ceasing to exist
i agree i have protected the Palestinians for years. That is all out the window with the brutal murdering of innocent people across Israel.  Fuxckin pussies  targeting unarmed people and killing babies are a terrorist act. You can count on this. That day changed more than my mind. It shows how Hamas  negotiates and it showed who  the Palestinian civilians  really are.  Hamas is going to kill more Palestinians than Jews for there decision to attack in that fashion. Maybe if Palestinians learned to negotiate and show the world the horrible treatment they have been handed with peace the world would respond. But that is also out the window because of the terroristic activity Hamas did  and with the spitting on corpses by Palestinians civilians.
They sadly were not able to breach the cockpit there‚Äôs a transcript where you can hear them smashing the food cart into the door trying to bust it open so the pilot started dipping the plane up and down before they finally decided to crash the plane once they heard everyone had grouped up at the door.
You started the clip by giving everyone a description of what started. You forgot the part of Hamas firing over 5000 missiles at civilians in Israel. THAT WHAT STARTED THIS INCIDENT.
they weren't at 30K feet
I cried reading it. When you're done, read "The Day the World Came to Town." It's about all the U.S.-destined planes that were diverted to Gander, Newfoundland when U.S. airspace closed. The citizens of Gander and surrounding towns took excellent care of almost 7,000 passengers and crew members for several days. Pretty much everybody in the towns dedicated themselves to taking care of a bunch of traumatized, stranded strangers. It is such a heartwarming book.
Fucking idiot.  Nazi sympathizer
WRONG!  Dumbass
Wow I will for sure get that book. I‚Äôm positive I‚Äôll cry reading it though. I still cry listening to the reading of the names every year. Thank you very much.
I do this morbid thing where I look around the terminal and think "these could be the last people I ever see". Then board the plane and enjoy the ride.
NDT has a long history of saying painfully obvious things dressed up in a lot of intellectual verbiage.
Nice. This is a fuc*ing terrorist. Good Job Israel#free Israel
Apparently, some of them (on Flight 93) held out hope that they might be able to take the plane back and perform a survivable crash landing. I'm sure they all must have known the odds were bad, but a slim hope of survival is better than no hope, so it was a sensible plan. Besides, they didn't want to be used to kill a bunch of people on the ground. One of them told his wife that they were waiting until they were above a rural area before attempting to take the plane back. You can read more about them in all sorts of books, of course, but I recommend "The Only Plane in the Sky." It's an oral history of the day with stories from many, many people.
This is why i avoid picking any side except for the ones that charish human life.  It is a lonely existence‚Ä¶ üò¢
Are you on something?
Famous saying Hate breeds hate
I don't get why there are conspiracy theories about this?  The F-16 pilot in question, Heather Penney, had said she was fully prepared to ram United 93 in a suicide mission in order to save civilian lives on the ground.  She would have to ram because the F-16s were not kept armed and there was no time to load them.  As it happened United 93 crashed before they got there.  But there was never any doubt they were ready to take it down.https://abcnews.go.com/US/fighter-pilot-reflects-911-suicide-mission/story?id=79898230
How did they get phone calls on the flight?
The Internet hasn't been infatuated with NDT in like a decade, where've you been mate
Is this surprising? "If your plane hits something you die pretty fast"
She just assumed from the beginning that they already supported hamas and in the end after all the facts were layed out, the only thing she could muster was to ask them if they liked hamas though she still had the audacity of calling them terrorists as she did it.
lol   OK you win.
Guessing it‚Äôs a train station mate
Reminds me of the Titanic sub that imploded. I think they said that the time it took for the sub to impolde was quicker than it takes for the human nervous system to register pain
Why is this broken down by him though? This is such common sense. Why is this needed? We all watched the video of the planes. It was instantaneous.
wtf, i was just thinking about this a couple hours ago...
People running up to catch trains
Yeah, the people in the plane had no choice in the matter.  It was out of their hands, and it was only going to end one way.The people in the tower, in the other hand, *knew* they were gonna die, but they had to make a choice:  succumb to the fire or jump to their death.  I can‚Äôt even imagine what it felt like in those moments.
Can't have a NDT attack without some Reddit nerd defending him
The real question is what was going on with the people running past in the background?  That's what I want to know.
She thought it was a Pakistan flag the entire time...&amp;#x200B;![gif](giphy|JSueytO5O29yM)

Y‚Äôall are such donkeys, you arguing over a false statement a reporter made (surprise) and then publicly admitted to making the false report based on hearsay and not facts. Fuck Hamas ok sure but what of the everyday Jews parading on film that not one single child is alive in Gaza and that Gaza is a cemetery? Both sides are atrocious and our world is completely fucked, you‚Äôre a piece of shit and so am I. Now go about your day being the piece of shit you are and I will go about mine in the same fashion.
Yeah obviously . I can see what a great human been you are man . The world will be really great with "smart" people like you i can see
Well thats something we can both agree on
Yeah sure mate , and you are for sure right . Let's give the isreal the land and let them keep killing innocent people. Yeah yeah for sure
First kingdom is Israel was 11th century bce
There‚Äôs nothing to understand besides that your wrong.
You have to remember that no one had suicided a plane before.  In fact, there were somewhat regular [hijackings to Cuba](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Cuba%E2%80%93United_States_aircraft_hijackings) all the time.  It would have never crossed peoples minds to do anything other than sit tight and get flown back home after it was over.
And if your simple mind couldn't understand a simple thing why would even bother to talk
we have given roughly 10billion to Israel in the last three years and 75 billion to Ukraine.
It was almost comforting until he said goo
Fascism is a nasty thing.
Honestly, I would MUCH rather go out instantly than to get cancer or some un-curable disease where I waste away for months or years in pain and agony. Not to say that I wouldn't want to get to choose when I go or get to say goodbye to my loved ones.
For some reason we democrats are unable to say the word trump without using a phrase like "orange" "fat" or "stupid". It makes us seem like the stupid ones. All we're doing is attacking someone's character providing no backing to our argument. I do know history and I'm tired of people telling me what I should think or know. I'm not even a republican but looking at it in an unbias pov Trump was one of the best things that's happened to this country in the last 20 years. If he had a second term we would of seen economic growth like no other ( basically 4 more years of what we already had with him). Instead we have Pedo Biden and his Druggie son. Also I hope u caught that there, see what I did? I did a character attack by just bringing him up providing no proof or evidence. It's why that "orange" shit is dumb asf.
I agree with him that this is a holy war. A peaceful settlement is just not possible on that border.
Well if you don‚Äôt even know to say what you ‚Äútruly‚Äù mean then why would anyone listen to you.
And the OceanGate incident was even faster
attracting tourism and trying to get likes is not propaganda lol
It is known that there was an *attempt* to retake the plane.  It is not known if there were able to breach the cockpit and in the ensuing battle the hijacker pilot just nosed into the ground or if the passengers were trying to wrestle for control and that cause the crash, or if it was determine to be a lost cause and they were shot down.  My absolute guess is the second.
Bunch of grown ass men getting into it with a child and the kid is the one getting arrested...
Prevention is better then cure‚Ä¶ Hamas will only regroup and do it again in a few years. Finish them
Yeah, it's incredibly annoying how watching one video mostly about science almost instantly changes what the algorithm suggests to you when you've got years-long watch history of videos that are completely opposite of the ones they are now suggesting. Like, unless I had a stroke or traumatic brain injury, my personality, interests, and morals aren't going to change that quickly.
Ouh my it is just an example you fucking idiot.You just keep seeing that point without seeing what i am truly trying to say.
And the jew lost their land centuries ago so they have no right to say that they own it .I do believe that both parties shoud accept the division of the land and none of them should say it is ours so you have to leave it
You just compared selling a home to the conflict in Israel and gaza. fucking lol
Plus they weren't the first in that land mate , maybe before muslims but there was people before the Jews lived there
Because they sold it. Lol terrible comparison.
No one is denying that .But by the year 1946 it wasn't theirs for centuries.I live in a house who was occupied but 2 families before i moved . They didn't come to me now demanding it to give it back because their ancestors used to live in it.
When I smoked I would‚Äôve loved to cheef with these cats
I am more angry at the people who will just keep saying the worst shit when they just don't make their researches . You have a brain to use and not just to accept everything thing was told to you . I don't get it why people just keep believing them like this
Benjamin Netanyahu"Beat them up , not once but repeatedly,beat them up so it hurts so badly, until it's unbearable"Rabbi Eli Ben Dahan:"Palestinians are beasts , not human."Avigdor Lieberman:"Those who are against us,there's nothing to be done - we need to pick up an axe and cut off his head"Those are just little things that isreal Government are saying what makes this okay for you and not what hamas said ?
What's the trick?

It's astounding how fast the algorithm decides "Ah, I see you believe that feminism is responsible for the decline of western society! Here's a guy spending 2 hours talking about Lizzo being in WOKE Star Wars!"
So, in my other comment I asked for links to let me know if Michio is an asshole... and then I noticed your link.  I will agree with whoever made that video that he was not the person to put on at that moment and talk about hurricanes.  I watched the whole video and wish I hadn't because she came across as a hater and was hard to watch.Michio was excited about the topic and that's what I like about him.  Put him in front of the camera and let him be excited and get the audience excited about the topic as well.(and Pluto is still a planet)
Did you do the calculations though?That‚Äôs an easy conclusion to make once you‚Äôve seen and heard of NDTs expert calculations. Idk if you could have figured that on your own.
Luckily it was a fast death but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that everyone was probably at the point of dying from fear
I watched a pov animation from the hijackers and feel like the route they took was obvious that they weren't landing it. They came in from the north and flew directly over manhattan (or whatever its called north of actual manhattan) aimed straight at the tip of manhattan which, to me, feels obvious. I know there's a few airports that way they could turn towards but they were so completely centered in between the bay and river and pointed straight at NYC.
Disgusting
767 is 48.5m long.400mph is 178m/s0.27 seconds from nose to tail.Now I am magic science man.

So you admit the Jews were there first?

As i said i never and will never say what Hamas did is right and i don't support them at all. But the isreal government did the same thing to the Palestine people ,why are you not talking about the horrors they caused to them all those years and just keep bringing what is Hamas doing now .And even when hamas didn't attack isreal ,This year they attacked the people of Palestine in the Aqsa mosque witch lead to many victims . Imagine you are in the church praying and some people break into and start beating you. This is a simple example of what the Palestinians are suffering.And why you wouldn't say that the isreal government should stop their injustice and cruelty so hamas will not attack them.So is it okay for Israel to attack Palestine and the Palestinians to do nothing.But if they try to defend themselves they became a terrorist and Israeli just trying to save itself?
The people who listen to this podcast on a weekly basis

Cool!!
Oddly comforting that nobody on the plane suffered even for a second
Genocide, murder, rape, illegal occupation, apartheid, terrorism, war crimes, 75 years of killing of innocent civilians in Palestine, playing the victim in a situation they created, portraying false killings on the media for the sympathy of Zionist supporters
From the Hamas Covenent  Article 7: The Day of Judgement will not come about until Moslems fight the Jews (killing the Jews), when the Jew will hide behind stones and trees  Article 15:  In face of the Jews' usurpation of Palestine, it is compulsory that the banner of Jihad be raised.
By and large, redditors need to attack any living person with intelligence because they're threatened by someone smarter than themselves. It's jealousy. He's a science communicator..I thought you guys like science?
Try doing all that stuff in Israel as well, dumbass.
First of all, there's a reason why their Muslim neighbors in Egypt are keeping them out and has built the same fences and gates that Israel has.   Watch the live feeds, and every day you will see hundreds (at least) projectiles that are launched from Gaza and shot down by the Iron Dome. If Hamas really cared about Palestinians they would quit launching attacks when they know the Israeli's are going to counter attack.

You're right! Those final moments would have been gruesome.As Pink Floyd says in a song: 'You strech the final moments with your fear'....
Your 9/11 is our 24/7.
i respect jews as a religon not as thier current state
some funny stuff i found onlineyes they are forbidden according to Torah, Talmud, their own highly rated scholars and the bible , heres some samples, the problem is Israel has degenerated to a secular liberal state who do not follow their own religion anymore and the arguments for it are from the perspective of secular liberalism not religion.Biblical Verses Foretelling That G-d Will Send the Jews into ExileLeviticus 26:33And if you do not listen to Me, and do not keep all these commandments‚Ä¶ and I will scatter you among the nations, and send the sword after you, and your land will be desolate, and your cities destroyed.Deuteronomy 4:25I call to witness today heaven and earth that you will perish quickly from the land that you are crossing over the Jordan to possess; you will not stay long on it‚Ä¶And G-d will scatter you among the peoples, and you will be left few in number in the nations where G-d will lead you.Deuteronomy 11:16Take heed to yourselves, lest your hearts be seduced, and you turn away and serve other gods, and bow to them. Then G-d will be angry at you, and He will close up the heavens and there will be no rain, and the earth will not give its produce, and you will perish quickly from upon the good land that G-d gives you.Deuteronomy 28:36G-d will lead you and your king, whom you will appoint over you, to a nation you and your fathers did not know.Deuteronomy 28:63You shall be moved off the good land which you come to inherit, and G-d will scatter you among all the nations, from one end of the earth to the other.Biblical Verses Saying that the Jewish People Will be Gathered in from Exile Only When the Messiah ComesIsaiah 11:1-12A royal scepter will emerge from the stock of Jesse, and a sapling will sprout from his roots. The spirit of G-d will rest upon him, the spirit of wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and power, the spirit of knowledge and fear of G-d‚Ä¶ And it shall come to pass on that day, that the L-rd will once again acquire the rest of His people‚Ä¶and He will gather the dispersed of Israel, and the scattered of Judah He will gather from the four corners of the earth.Ezekiel 37:21-24So says the L-rd G-d, behold I will take the Children of Israel from among the nations where they have gone, and I will gather them from all sides, and I will bring them to their land‚Ä¶and My servant David will be king over them, one shepherd will be for all of them.
Pretty low bar.
Drowning isn't that bad comparatively. People think it is, because almost everyone knows what it feels like to run out of air. But that feeling is nothing compared to burning, for example.
i never said jews dont deserve to live i said what was written in thier book deny the truth as much as you want but dont insult me
I sure hope not.  If anybody has a link to something, go ahead and ruin it for me...
I have to remind myself of that fact every time I fly (the drive to the airport is more dangerous than my flight)
Well my wife's high school is named after the guy who initiated the battle by passengers to retake control of the plane, so I certainly hope it's a little bit better understood than that.
Here‚Äôs what I listened to the end of the clip for but was left (initially) disappointed.
The guy isn't a Moron, He's literally an astrophysicist and cosmologist. Yeah he oversteps his bounds and uses a logical fallacy often in a place where he doesnt belong.But he isn't a moron.I dont see why the world has to be so black and white, why people have to be so one faceted to others. Why exactly do you paint an entire complex person down to single word?This is just mental masturbation. You arent any smarter than he is.
Just want to warn people that if you watch even one clip of his on youtube, the algorithm will start flooding you with stuff from Joe Rogan, Jordan Peterson, and Andrew Tate. The only way to cleanse your algorithm is to delete your history of watching his clips.
My frustration is the conclusion he shares (in this clip) is incredibly vague, imprecise, and obvious. They die in ‚Äòfractions of a second‚Äô or ‚Äòinstantaneously‚Äô‚Ä¶ obviously. Yet it feels like he is pretending to do ‚Äúcalculations‚Äù and pretending like his curiosity and knowledge got him to any actual real or different or meaningful answer. Maybe it did but he doesn‚Äôt share it (again in this clip, maybe he does in the full version).There‚Äôs no calculation or anything at all mentioned- and the calculation here is like basic algebra. He is telling the other guy he is wrong and arguing the speed of the plane going 400mph vs 500mph like it actually matters only to then give a conclusion so vague that detail he argued over is 100% meaningless. Not only is it meaningless he‚Äôs also making it up, he didn‚Äôt do a frame by frame speed analysis or something, he‚Äôs assuming based on the plane needing to turn. It‚Äôs frustrating because the guy is just stating the incredibly obvious but acting like he‚Äôs somehow super smart for coming to that conclusion. And in doing so wasting everyone time because he doesn‚Äôt actually say anything new or remotely interesting to anyone. Another comment reply actually did the math which is at least something. Nothing wrong with being as correct as possible but this guy just was pretending to be (in this clip)
Most of the passengers on flight 11 had no idea what was going on. All the transcripts of phone calls the flight attendants made are available to read, as well as all ATC communication. There was a ton of confusion and even after the flight 11 hit the tower, ATC and the authorities didn‚Äôt even realize it and they believed that the plane continued on past Manhattan.
There‚Äôs multiple videos. His math is useless. We have multiple records of the speed
Good show no mercy give no quarter
Joe: but what would it be like if you were on DMT?
nope
Pathetic waist of oxygen
Yes.  That's the philosophical portion of the conversation but this was an analytical analysis based on a question.
that's why i think the people in the imploded titanic submersible were in a better place.  morbidly speaking.i don't think the submersible people even were aware that they were about to implode.  they may have been trying to look at something in wonder, then - nothing.  your last thought being "wow... look at that cool--" then nothing.
I tried to get quickly caught up about the underlying conflict that appears to be embedded into the culture.  I found a good summary article about Israel Jerusalem history which gives me the indication that Jews have passionate about the area, non stop, for thousands of years whereas all others appear to be occupiers who simply took over the area, then got wiped out by the next occupier.  So it appears that there is just a culture of ongoing conflict for all nations in that area, against a group who is passionate to remain in the area mainly driven by religious reasons with roots that are thousands of years old.If I'm not wrong, the argument between these groups is no different than Canada and indigenous people.  Whereas, Canada has put aside the narrow history time span of 100 years and colonization, and recognized that indigenous people were here well before that which has resulted in land being given back and hundreds of billions of dollars of payout to indigenous groups over the years. Do you think my summary of history, at a broad level, is relatively accurate? If yes, then its really an argument being had about when in history do we draw the line and who's right.  That's more of a political sensitive question, but if we were to accept the same perspective as what is applied in Canada, then Israel might be the equivalent of indigenous people of the west. I haven't heard anyone approach this with that perspective, so I'm curious on your thoughts?  I'm not here to suggest I am right, or that I am wrong.
To intervene Against Hamas Because they killed US citizensAnd we‚Äôre still doing GWOT
I still remember this and still feel the same! Parking lot!
Support more!
I really don't remember any pain.
I thought that the first moments after inhaling water are excruciating and then when you‚Äôre on the verge of passing you feel a wave of calmness. Thats what i‚Äôve heard atleast‚Ä¶
There are windows in the plane.  Everyone would have been able to see how low they were flying as they entered the city.  The realization that they intended to crash the plane was the horror.
That's why so many people jumped from the towers. The unbearable pain from the flames overcame their instinct not to jump.
&gt; Literally getting on a plane in 12 hours.You're *at least* an order of magnitude more likely to die driving to the airport than in a commercial airline disaster. It's probably multiple orders of magnitude, but I'm far too lazy to look up statistics.
Of course but that doesn't make his tricks any less annoying.
Or being forced to leap from the towers...
Knowing what he knows would fill me with anxiety from morning to night.
If you really think about you can die anytime really the world can end intently in so many ways it's best to not think about it and just vib with existences![gif](giphy|3lxD1O74siiz5FvrJs|downsized)
For what it's worth, modern airplanes have something called TCAS.  It uses radar to look for nearby aircraft and can even tell the pilots to go in opposite directions (up and left and down and right) if they get too close.
its not the death moment itself that haunted them, it was the anxiety and fear as they realized what was about to happen
The things I‚Äôve seen them do to their own people! Placing explosives on children, making a 5 year old girl try to drop a lunch box off an over pass on a convoy, slaughtering villages if they do do exactly as told, I‚Äôve seen heads cut off and limbs removed from teens and young adults for not following the early influences of ISIS/IS/ISIL, I mean it‚Äôs a shit show in the Middle East. If the VA would fix me up I‚Äôd be glad to go help out again though. Not a worry on my mind that I know in my heart that not one blood cell would hesitate to lend a helping hand to ruining Hamas and anyone who supports or kept them in power. And they need to stop with the ‚Äúchildren‚Äù bullshit. These people need to do some math here. If you are in a city run by terrorists from 20 years ago when they were cheering on the 9/11 attack and you are 14-17 you have been heavily influenced and indoctrinated into that mind set. So is a 14-17 yr old a child when they have a weapon and the mindset of a terrorist 20 years ago???? How much influence inside Gaza has come from the outside? I doubt very much, but the terrorist cells that were cooking in a hot sweaty room in the 2nd floor of some derelict building planing to kill a bunch of people in settlements and at a music festival sure had enough influence in that city to cause NOT CHILDREN but active combatants to commit those atrocities.
Joe Rogan makes everything less interesting.
Nah man. Ain't no way in hell we going door to door in yet another Middle Eastern conflict. We've tried like three times now, and every time it ends disastrously.   Unless we're blowing a crater the size of England into the holy-land, we can't help you anymore.
He's still smarter than the vast majority of us here on Reddit
He‚Äôs objectively pompous.
Literally getting on a plane in 12 hours.
I found him interesting but then a Redditor pointed out the tricks he uses to sound more intelligent. I haven't been able to listen to him since. It reminds me of how I like Family Guy but never really thought about how every joke was a flashback. Then someone pointed it out and I couldn't unsee it.
Of it not being instantaneous‚Ä¶.
The people in the first 2 planes didn't know the plane was going to crash. The terrorists said over the intercom (and over the radio by accident) that they were going to land the plane at another airport. That probably made the people think they just wanted money and everything would be fine. Only on the last plane, the one that was supposed to hit the capital/Whitehouse, did some of the passengers get calls from family telling them what had happened to the towers. The people on that plane overpowered the terrorists in the hallway and were trying to kick down the door to the cockpit. The terrorists realised they weren't going to make it to Washington so they went nose-down and crashed into the ground instead. https://youtu.be/AKNkyN57UTk?si=hnywYbcmvsN_5cqb
Goddamn we need Carl Sagan back
I couldn‚Äôt agree more.    The straight savages I have seen in Iraq and Afghanistan make me have no care about any hamas life.   I hope all of hamas dies
My ancestors will look favorably upon me as I fight holy jihad in the name my people. My war club stands at the ready for our great nation.
...and you are a dishonest clown....
Nope, as someone who almost drowned, literally on the verge of death and ended up in a hospital. I didn't feel pain, I felt exhausted and I was fully aware that I was about to drown.
&gt;He debated the 500 vs 400 mph like it mattered just to get the same conclusion of ‚Äòinstantaneous‚Äô death. I don't understand why this is a bad thing. This is exactly the kind of mentality you would want a scientist of any field to have. They should be taught to always be as correct as provably possible.
That‚Äôs‚Ä¶ man‚Ä¶
....they know.....
r/oddlycomforting.
Captain obvious finds out:*a crash in one of the fast vehicle of transport is one of the fastest crashes!*
Jeez thanks man. Now I‚Äôll never fly the same again
Ah yes..... I remember this all too well.   My thoughts are with ISRAEL in all this.
I often think about this on a plane. At any moment it could crash head on into another plane, and you can never predict it because you can't see ahead of the plane. So at any moment you could just pop out of existence, instantly vaporised before your brain can know what happened.    So the entire time you're flying, you're in this weird state where any given moment could be your last. And you'd never know which moment it was.    You could say it's like that all the time. But in most cases you'd have some brief awareness - a car coming towards you, etc.
this comes as NO surprise at all.  Part of the "axis of evil".  They all work together now (Russia.... Iran.... China... N. Korea).  Pure evil all 4 of them.
Answer:  No.
This analyst included report and videos in his latest video.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6PO-vbQpp84
This is extremely vague and lacks a ton of information leading to the causes of early conflict.[Plan Dalet](https://imeu.org/article/plan-dalet)[King David Hotel](https://www.google.com/search?q=bombing+of+king+david+hotel&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;hl=en-us&amp;client=safari)[Deir Yassin Massacre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deir_Yassin_massacre)Here‚Äôs a well written book albeit biased. But factual nonetheless. [The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ethnic_Cleansing_of_Palestine)
Isn't Michio kind of an asshole though?
So I did the math and here are the numbers: excluding the front and back of the plane, the inside is about 40m long, 400 mph is 178.816 m/s so 40/178.816 = 0,2236936292sWith 500mph or 223.52m/s, 40/223.52 = 0,1789549034sSo the difference is less than &lt;0.05s, in comparison an average blinking lasts 0.15 seconds.So you would literally die in a blink of an eye.
There was one of the flight attendants that managed to get a phone and she was like "oh my god we are flying too low in the city, we are going to crash" and right after this, they hit the tower.But it was the same for the people in Japan that were inside the range of the nuke with the extreme heat, where they just vaporized instantly, they never knew what happened.
Probably won‚Äôt be fast enough for me; Sheesh!
Yeah, like buddy I figured out that they died in less than a second the first time I saw it happen, when I was 12.
I'm neutral. Never understood the hype or how he got famous but he doesn't really bother me either other than maybe a couple of odd takes he might have had. His presentation style is not very inspiring but adequate. I always figured that I compared him to Carl Sagan which is a difficult act to follow in terms of eloquence.
I just asked my husband about it last week. Wondered if they knew they were going to die. I really hope they had no clue obviously. He said they probably knew. At least it was instantaneous.
Neil or OP who found an immediate undiscernable death 'terrifying as fuck'?
I thought the fourth plane was rehijacked by the passengers?
You know hes just chatting with Joe right? Its not some scientific meeting. I dont like his personality, but they are just talking here. Completely harmless.
He never said that it was difficult, only that he calculated it.
Sure,  Michio lacks that off-putting attitude that Tyson sports - it reeks of deep insecurity like he's getting back at everyone who ever wronged him (which I believe is a lot of people.   And ffs, stop complaining about bad science in space movies.  They're not documentaries. That said, Michio presents super speculative things like they are firmly agreed on, and seems to have a delivery style perfectly tuned for clickbait.   I find him weirdly worse. IMO, Brian Cox is the best heir to Carl Sagan's legacy:  science + poetry + hopeful polemics.
From what I understand, it‚Äôs believe that the burning North Tower would‚Äôve been visible to passengers on 175 as it banked towards the city. It wouldn‚Äôt be a leap to think they might have put together what was happening in those last moments.
I mean he said he was doing calculations to figure out exactly how long you‚Äôd have and just said ‚Äúfractions of a second‚Äù. Like no shit. He debated the 500 vs 400 mph like it mattered just to get the same conclusion of ‚Äòinstantaneous‚Äô death. There‚Äôs no context here and it‚Äôs clipped but this clip is just frustrating.
Shill Degrass Tyson
exactly! doing 1+1 is a calculation, doesn't have to be complex as shit
Things that really never needed to be thought about.
I don‚Äôt know how aware the passengers in 11 or 175 were that the hijackings were a suicide mission. The ones in United 93 certainly were because it was the last flight to crash and they had already received the news of the WTC hijackings. I could be wrong though.
Separate laws are applied depending on ethnic background.
Almost everything else would be better than drowning or burning to death as they‚Äôre one of the most painful ways to die, no?
Galaxy brain
He may be the guy you want doing science, but not representing science. IMHOEdit:  I like this guy better for repping science: Michio Kaku
But they suffered a lifetime during the hijack, murder of staff/people, and seeing they are running into a building. Goo or no goo, they all suffered too long.
Didn't the British create Israel?
Well he was probably interested in the specific figure, like we can all guess it was instantaneous, but figuring out exactly what that means in a scientific perspective isnt something you just guess.
The guy just rubs me the wrong way. There is arrogance to him that makes me not want to even listen to what he has to teach or say. I love science and Fanboy to many scientists but he's kinda cringey to me
Two planes hit buildings at high speed, exploding immediately. Everyone onboard is presumed immediately dead, by everyone who ever saw footage of the impact for 20 years.Neil DeGrasse Tyson: I calculated through calculations that they died instantly
I know it has. Doesn't make it right.
You can‚Äôt even wipe ass with your suggestions
Tyson and I think about different things from day to day.
"It's fascinating how soothing they both sound. Listen..." \*farts\*
There's still a terrifying moment before the crash, knowing you're gonna die soon along with your family. I'd say it's equally terrifying mentally as it is while drowning
That‚Äôs been going on for centuries.  New to this planet?
I wish this tyson guy would just shut up and go away. Such an ‚Äúi am very smart‚Äù wanker
Technically, even if basic, it's still a calculation
You don‚Äôt need to be NdGT to have worked that one out, surely. Anyway, it‚Äôs the period between hijack and impact that‚Äôs the worst bit! üòû
Everyone who‚Äôs laughing and celebrating deserves a jdam enema üñï
People with Hollywood brains.So basically, most.
My guess is being able to comprehend it vs no having had the opportunity to at all due to insane speed
Nobody expect the Panih inquizition
yeah but how hard would it be to repurpose those? probably not that hard
That‚Äôs actually semi-comforting
Epana!
I have never heard anything smart in a conversation of these two. But always the mind blow music in the background lmfao
So kind of like the time frame and what happened to the Titanic submersible
Yeah the people IN the tower definitely had it worse‚Ä¶ in a way. I guess the entire highjacking was the buildup to their death much like drowning but without the physical pain. Horrible way to go
Who didn‚Äôt already know this?
He loves to make himself sound fancy.
Having to jump from the tower‚Ä¶
Yeah no shit sherlock
I always hated this guy.
Denial and willful ignorance of history also fuels support of large scale ethnic cleansings.
Next he‚Äôs going to tell everyone the sun is probably hotter than anything on the planet.
Hamas started it and now Israel is finishingit
Dont act like you don‚Äôt like smelling your own farts bruh
‚Äú yeah I calculated that it takes no time to die in a plane crash. Took me like five hours.‚Äù Joe Rogan: üò±
üá™üá∏but the s is silent
Doesn‚Äôt seem like a very difficult thing to calculate lol
What's the alternative?
TIL less than a second is in fact a fraction of a second. Thanks Neil.
"Well. Actually. There isn't any substance in human fart that can get me high. I just like the smell AND the sound, almost as much as my own voice."
Any difference in consistency than non-pulverized goo, I wonder? Let‚Äôs ask Neil.
All that brain power to just come to the conclusion that the passengers died instantly when having the plane crash into a building ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è this guy is a sham lol
he had to do calculations to figure that out?
*pulverized pile of goo*
NDT gets high on the smell of his own farts
But how long would it take to kiss someone else in a mirror?
Better off than the people who had to decide to jump from the towers I suppose
As terrifying as this is, the alternative is even more terrifying.
The 100 videos that played for years confirms this. Thanks not-Einstein guy.
very good info/watch thanks for that.
At least it's better than burning to death or drowning
yes chat GPT
why would you compare hamas to the harmless palestinians?
they are currently looking for basic human rights not womens right or whatever other rights so lets achieve the basic human rights and then we could talk about all the other rights
Reads like Chat GPT.  Which one did you use?
Those are stanchions for hand rails.   Good try.

If Israel gave all of Gaza away and let it be free would that stop Muslims from wanting to destroy Israel?
if Israeli people and government think that it will end here they are very wrong.If they can't find a solution, they're new neighbors are going to be 10x more violent. Now all the "people" are gone...no more civilians.USA can't afford to get involved.
Isreals  escalation ?  Lol theu were attacked.  What did hamas think would happen ?
Isreal supporting Hamas is a misconception, they never directly supported them. Hamas was founded in the late 1980s as a Palestinian resistance movement with the goal of ending Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories and establishing a Palestinian state. While there have been allegations and conspiracy theories suggesting that Israel supported Hamas to undermine the PLO, these claims lack substantial evidence and have been widely discredited.
Like [these](https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8hUmQxo/)?
How long does someone have to live on a land before it's theirs. Nobody should be able to write words on paper and claim that land from the inhabitants.
I agree with you. Just understand that the Palestinians aren't doing anything the Jews haven't done. I'm a firm believer that in war only soldiers should be killed buts sadly that's rarely the case.
Yea this war is the worst
It‚Äôs to deter other nations (particularly Iran) from jumping in, not to deter Israel/Hamas.
Man i think it was some DUDE that just said " yo god said this shit" ....prolly because somebody stole his girl.Fucking no way there is supposed to be this much hate.
Yea you can‚Äôt video yourself killing a thousand civilians including women and children and not expect a response.  This all would have been easier if Palestinians didn‚Äôt support Hamas.  I pray it is over quickly and that suffering is minimized, but nobody cares about your ‚Äúpeople‚Äù now
‚ÄúNow go and attack the Amalekites and completely destroy everything they have. Do not spare them. Kill men and women, infants and nursing babies, oxen and sheep, camels and donkeys.‚Äù (1 Sam 15:3)That is what God told the Hebrews to do to the people living in the land that is now Isreal.
Thank you for that summary.

Ah the good old deflection tactic, "there are no innocent Isreali politicians ". Remember who supported HAMAS in the first place, as a counter to the PLO. Who was happy with the world's largest open air prison sitting across the road.
AI synopsis, hope this helpsAfter World War I, the British Empire gained control of the territory that is now Israel and Palestine through the League of Nations' mandate system. The area was known as the British Mandate for Palestine, and this mandate was established in 1920, following the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire.    The British Mandate for Palestine was governed under the terms of the League of Nations' mandate system, which aimed to prepare territories for self-government while maintaining the peace and security of the region. The mandate for Palestine was unique in that it included a commitment to the establishment of a "national home for the Jewish people" in Palestine, as outlined in the Balfour Declaration of 1917.    During the mandate period, tensions between the Jewish and Arab populations in Palestine grew. The Jewish population, which had been immigrating to the region for decades, increased significantly. Arab residents were concerned about the impact of Jewish immigration on their political and economic status. This tension led to conflicts and violence between the two communities.    The British authorities struggled to manage the situation, and the Mandate period was marked by ongoing violence, uprisings, and tensions between Jewish and Arab communities. After World War II and the Holocaust, the pressure to create a Jewish state intensified, and the British Mandate for Palestine became increasingly untenable.    In 1947, the United Nations approved a partition plan for Palestine, which recommended the division of the territory into separate Jewish and Arab states, with international administration of Jerusalem. The plan was accepted by Jewish leaders but rejected by Arab leaders. This eventually led to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, resulting in the establishment of the State of Israel and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinian Arabs.    The British Mandate for Palestine formally ended on May 14, 1948, when the State of Israel declared its independence. After that, Israel and its neighboring Arab states continued to be in conflict over issues related to borders, refugees, and the status of Jerusalem, which continues to this day. The Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a significant issue in the region's geopolitics.
I, like you, do not condone any killing of civilians. The Palestinian citizens have a right to live as much as the Jewish people. Unfortunately it appears that Hamas will not hesitate to use them as human shields...
Time to watch hamas and Palestinian burn
Collective defense is what it is. That‚Äôs should be clear by now.
Western values are so worth holding onto. The irony is that it‚Äôs these values that will save many Palestinian lives in the coming months.
 I actually can believe how racist everyone is , no surprises here from the good oul rooting tooting oh here there‚Äôs a school that needs shooting America üá∫üá∏
So we both agree that America is stupid?
i am still convinced that what ever hamas did aint relavent to what was done by isreal while occupying the Palestinian land the houses that were destroyed and people were placed in lands with no water and shit i dont care what hamas did not all i know that thier goal is revenge and thats what a human would do
it was said in the turah that jews shouldnt have thier country they arem ment to live between people i see why now
üò®
IDK. I don't think anyone is a demon bro
Yea as it turns out every bordering country several times tried to remove the Jews from Israel.  Why we the USA have given them aid. Also its fun watching extremist muslims get their asses beat over and over. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_Israel
Palestines lost all sympathy from me when they celebrated the attacks of the World Trade Center. It let me know what kind of people they are. It‚Äôs time to be irradiated from earth, clearly you do not belong in a civilized world.

Hello i am here with the video
It disgusts me that people living far away from Palastine and or Isreal have nothing better to do than run their mouths on a topic they have little knowledge about.I can't claim to know enough about the situation in order to pick a side but atleast I am honest about it.Seeing people glorifying the killing of innocent civilians on both sides is just outright heinous and despicable.This global sensationalism of war and suffering is outright disgusting.Whether you support one side or the other none of you aren't going to do anything about it.So sit tight and let them figure it out.Treat any current information coming from a Warzone as unreliable would be a reasonable and logical way to go about it.Be glad that you and your loved ones are safe, I hope they are.
The U.S. has been giving financial aid, weapons, and ammo to Israel since WW2.
I hope Israel smashes the living shit out of Hamas.
Better then having Trump LARP being a tough guy while trading Iran classified documents on the side.
Quick, get Joe to send some more money
Reality?So why western media and ignorant people  Palestinians terrorist FOR DEFENDING THEMSELVES yet when the oppressor is doing it EVERY DAY FOR 75 YEARS not a breath is heard??They arrest citizens, kill civilians, and evict me from my home. They imprison me within my own country. I cannot travel from city to city in my own country. They cut off water, gas, and electricity. They suppress riots with internationally prohibited bombs. They kill children simply because they are Palestinians, and there are hundreds of videos documenting this.75 years of killing of innocent civilians in Palestine, playing the victim in a situation they created, portraying false killings on the media for the sympathy of Zionist supporters.
Stop them how? By attacking them?
Thanks for telling me.
A *peaceful people*
Worryingly, lots of countries of the Middle East even the world maybe get unpublic profit from this war and will not let the war end quickly this time.
Thats what I am trying to figure out, is their another way to end the cycle of hate.. Hell just air drop a shit ton of money on Palestine, people that have nothing to lose will fight.. those with a shit ton of money will not want to lose it or their lives.. lets face it apart from those that manipulate power to control others, most parents any where in the world simply want their kids to have a better life than they did.
Right, but if no one listens and no one try to change the centuries of hate in that region specifically. What‚Äôs that saying ‚Äúif you want peace you must prepare for war‚Äù that‚Äôs because no matter what you nor anyone else can change the past. The seeds of hate were planted long before anyone on this planet existed. Why?I‚Äôm a not trying to argue by the way. We both agree on the fact that hate breeds hate. Where we part is on how to fix this specific situation.
Having been to war you most likely realize the futility of it and that it solves nothing in the long run. You can win a battle but changing millions of peoples minds it cannot do, only more hate will be spawned.
Telegram
If you think a war, as both Israel and Hamas have both called this, that it‚Äôs ever ‚Äúok‚Äù for innocent people to die then that‚Äôs fucked up but I‚Äôve been in armed conflict with groups like Hamas. There is no negotiation no peace they are terrorist. They terrorize both Israelis and Palestinians. But the Palestinians have chosen Hamas as its face and unless Palestinians want to turn in or take out every Hamas member then these things happen. By defacto Palestinians are killing themselves.
Sounds like puke starts with an N.
They have already killed far more than Hamas did.. when is the score card of death even..1 million?
dropping more bombs than the USA did in last 10 years in many conflicts is pure revenge. wiping out Hamas and many non military people will not work.. Palestine is to big, to many people, you cannot find them all, you will only create more hate, thats what war does. Giving into to terrorism  is also not what Israel should do, but I am pretty sure what they are about to do may be worst long term act and history will judge them.Other solutions are possible..
So you are Xi‚Äôs 50 cents army here . How do you know the warning is fake ?   CCP is a gangster group , they could though anyone into jail if they want . So do you know anyone‚Äôs meaning?  CCP penetrated in US law system for long time .  Xi is evil boss of this war .  Target is crash US dollar.  Xi provide a lot of weapons to terrorist group.  So keep your working . Xi‚Äôs 50 cents army
I understand the emotions, I do, however this revenge war will be the end of Israel's years of "relative" peace. If Israel is perceived by other nations to have gone to far in its war on "terror" or religious belief, Israel will no longer have international compassion for its past hardships..support is what you need don't squander it.
Never there land
you do realize before that the land was controlled by the British? just saying...
Lots of this shit are old and fake. The pro Palestinian people trying to hard were not against Palestinian people. Well, not the good ones were against hamas scum bags that's it so stop with the trash videos ain't going to help you.
I'm saying, don't go around asking people who's demise you'd celebrate to have any sympathy for your suffering what-so-ever.Bomb that shit to ground and let nature reclaim it.
And? America was part of the UN that gave the Jews the Palestinian land. Are you dumb?
Don't fall for their crocodile tears.
No I'm just pointing out that Isreal bombing hospitals, news stations, etc isn't exactly a good thing either. They're both committing war crimes. There are no good guys here.Edit: a reminder that 50% of the Gaza Strip is Children.
This is the answer.. it‚Äôs a ‚Äúlook over here‚Äù so you don‚Äôt look in the other direction, action point. üíØ
I understand your argument. There is a line, not that it justifies it. It doesn‚Äôt really matter shooting unarmed people on the ground in cold blood is wrong.

Firstly it isn‚Äôt beyond so called security wall. Secondly the whole Israel is actually Palestinian land.
That‚Äôs actually not true the video you posted showed where they were at. North side of the Armistice line.
Yes 100%...also prevent hezbollah from attacking from Lebanon. America won't get invloved unless Isreal is threatened by other Muslim countries.
Its Palestinian land, there‚Äôs no wall.
Firstly were did you get the information of weapons. Outside of security WALL. It‚Äôs land of Palestinian‚Äôs its there choice to walk, run or whatever they want.
Yes you are a hateful person
So, Israel isn‚Äôt going eye for an eye. It‚Äôs not about revenge. It‚Äôs about Hamas will never be able to do this again. What good is an eye for an eye if it happens every two years? Enough is enough.
Well they‚Äôre humans not animals. And I don‚Äôt expect humans to attack unbeknownst. Killing innocent people specifically targeting elementary schools. Sounds like you already made up your mind on what side you support. And IMO you‚Äôve chosen the wrong side. Obviously both sides have done wrong things but when attacked you have to go to war and war isn‚Äôt pretty.
If the British Empire and Zionists hadn‚Äôt invaded and murdered the existing population in 1948 then this wouldn‚Äôt be going on. Immediately they made checkpoints and did Nazi paper please bs. This was the original sin. The population left were place behind the armistice walls and a nation was divided. Hamas only exists because Mossad started the organization to destabilize the surrounding nations. They made this Golem. They‚Äôve literally sown this and reaped its reward sow, reap, repeat. It‚Äôs continued to escalate for 75 years. Israel and the Brits caused this. Then everyone makes excuses for them. Israel is a cat playing with their prey for 75 years. Don‚Äôt even have the decency to kill it or let it go.
JDAM
Usually that‚Äôs what we do but y‚Äôall let yourselves get outta hand and now big daddy America needs to take a hot red white and blue dump on anyone threatening our security or the security of our close allies. After kicking in enough doors and almost dying due to someone‚Äôs delusions of grandeur and religious beliefs. The more I had to deal with the allah akbar crap the less I cared for any religion. I didn‚Äôt go to Iraq and push Catholicism on someone so your religion doesn‚Äôt need to be the worlds #1 shit bags. üá∫üá∏‚ù§Ô∏èüáÆüá±
Yo, OP is some palatine propaganda dude. THANKS FOR YOUR SERVICE. 1st cav 4-5ada proud combat vet here.
I‚Äôve been to war in the Middle East to have lost any recognition of a terrorist being close to human. They are just moving meat on the street.
America is there to stop Iran from getting involved, it‚Äôs the point of them trying to deter other foreign entities from involving themselves in the war. They have a right to get involved as 30 Americans are dead.
And yeah sorry but that‚Äôs how war works. This is revenge and maybe for the last time. You can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúI know we really fucked up killing innocents but look you don‚Äôt have to come for us just let it go‚Äù nah get fucked.
Here‚Äôs the deal. If you want the USA in a direct combat role AGAIN in the ME it‚Äôs not going to happen the same way. The 2000s shock and awe from the Bush presidency does not exist. This is parking lot time. You do not want to play fuck around and find out anymore. There will not be an ‚Äúanymore‚Äù if that happens.You think that those carriers are a threat, that‚Äôs nothing. It‚Äôs what can come from them you should worry about. I‚Äôm all for peace but I‚Äôm all for killin‚Äô terrorist. I promise my Jewish ancestry is coming through right now but my American heart is all for finally ending this.
It was also oddly suspicious that right out of the gate the media started grooming us to blame Iran despite there being no evidence for this.
Isreal is constantly threatening Palestinians for sure. It goes both ways my dude. Acting like Isreal hasn't done anything to prompt an attack is hilarious. Palestinians retaliating was an inevitability. I'm not saying what they're doing is justified, but I mean they've been forced to live in an open air prison. Everything they need to live is controlled by Israel, and they can't leave freely.Edit: When you treat a group of people like animals what do you expect?
No theyb ont they intend to kill hamas the fact of the matter is, is that if hamas didn't make war with Isreal there would be no more. Hamas doesn't care about their own civilians that's why they use them as meat shields
Or Hamas blasted the wall and was killing people so they retreated outside the wall to get away. Then were found and murdered and had weapons planted in the photo. Either way the weapons were found after they were killed.Sound plausible?
Yep. Get Iran and the US involved at the expense of a few 100k of its own .
Bro he‚Äôs probably a terrorist have u seen the child training camps? There is videos they dress like that holding guns talking about killing everyone crazy little 9 year olds
The ones who dont go into homes and cut off their heads. Obviously... Hamas has been threatening to kill jews for yesrs. So, they got their wish. Slaughtered jews. Yes. Israel can be heavy-handed, but if your neighbor constantly threatens to kill you. Throws rockets at you. How would you respond when they slaughter your own?
Looks like a desperate propaganda attempt to scare Israeli from entering ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è sorry man they are coming for u guys with jets tanks rockets boats guns yup‚Ä¶
Hammer is going to fall. Should take care when voting. This is what you get. Since Hamas took power, they have repeatedly tested the world. Time for them to be flushed out wherever they hide. For them to run and among the children is so beyond anything human .
Who cares what Lady Lindsay has to say. Damn ass two faced traitor.
Dropping your guns behind a tree or rock and pretending you‚Äôre just 4 guys from Gaza just out for a walk outside the boundary‚Äôs of security wall where they re not supposed to be, and coincidentally right at the exact same time there‚Äôs a large scale terror operation happening all around you Sounds plausible?The idf found the guns btw
Thank you. I want you to know there is bots around here, there is also funding for people to comment on the internet, intelligence, and media control. They will do whatever it takes to make Palestinians look bad. In recent events, Israel just issued evacuation orders to a HOSPITAL because they plan to bomb it. They are attempting to kill as many civilians as possible using the ‚ÄúHamas‚Äù excuse. Also, 50% of the population is children. I am not sure what those defending Israel are really arguing about.
There all underground they don‚Äôt give a fuck about the people up top
Super helpful lmao
Thank you for your comment, it‚Äôs people like you who‚Äôll make the world worth living in
Go watch aljazeera pretty good updates there
When you do something you acknowledge the consequences. To continue to do despite the consequences is intent.So the consequences of bombing is collateral damage, they intend to kill civilians period.
well the world is a better place to live in now compared to any other time in history.That is because we continue to search for ways to save lives, improve lives and share knowledge.My hope is we could use American military strength, or the threat of it, to save lives not allow more death. I doubt this can be contained to Israel getting revenge in Palestine,  far more likely the rest of the Middle East will pick sides.
The difference is intent. Isreal bombs Hamas and civilinad die as result of collateral damage(and Hmas cowards have a history of using civilians as meat shields). W here as hamas targets civilians. You can call me stupid all you want but I can figure that out. Hamas is a death cult that needs to be exterminated.
Just stop.
Trump‚Äôs social media is a great place to begin. Then Fox News.
I'm using Wikipedia as a source so it might not be 100% accurate. But if you go on the article [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History\_of\_Palestine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Palestine). And you go to the oldest section on the right "Prehistory". The first culture that preceded Palestine is the Natufian culture. Then before them was the Kebaran culture. Armian preceded next. Aterian preceded next. Mousterian preceded next. Achulean preceded next. The Oldowan preceded next. Supposedly the earliest group going by this route through the lineage of cultures is the Lomekwi 3.3 million years ago.
Unfortunately it‚Äôs not at all flippant. Have you read the Hamas constitution? Arguably brought upon themselves. Look into all the peace agreements Israel accepted that were rejected by Palestine (against their own best interest) in favor of wars they lost‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs realistic for any nation to reject the peace offered, go to war, lose, then say ‚Äújust kidding we‚Äôre good with the peace agreement after all‚Äù Lives are worth too much to be forced into war all for what would amount to nothing, although Israel has been known to win and return land anyway (Sinai, Gaza). Ridiculous really. Boundaries change as a result of war, that‚Äôs the way it is all over the world. Just look at Eastern Europe. What happened that they rejected the two state solution?
Actually no.  A combat veteran who has seen too many times how brutal humans can be.  I wish things were different but they won't be.  Isreal and Palestine will never find peace so let them get it over with.  As a kid in the 80's  I remember the Middle East in flames all the time.  My country has a large Christian Palestine population, I've done volunteer work there 3 times in the past 12 years.  I wish it were different, I can't say it enough, but those of us on the outside don't live the reality of the Isreali and Hamas injustices that Palestinos face daily.
Nope, not religious at all.
Thats exactly what I am suggesting, just include Israel as they have already had enough revenge in last few days..
I dont personally find it productive to make inflammatory statements about organizations that I have zero personal experience with.  I dont necessarily disagree that Hamas is a religious fanatical organization bent on homicidal revenge.  I just think comparing them to the KKK is taking the whole horrible situation a little flippantly.And the argument could also be made that Israel is the organization that has been "pulling the trigger" for generations on Palestinians.  And that Hamas has every right to defend themselves and their nation. This gets to the point i was trying to make in the original post, that while Israel is a colonial nation of a larger diaspora... looking to occupy already occupied land and the Palastinians remain under the boot of that occupation ... there is no universal right or entirely just action or stance. And this will never end... it will be a situation that the world will need to manage like this, for ever.  This is colonialism and as ever, it is abundantly clear that colonialism is a wound that never heals.
"For years, Palestinians have been under relentless attack (as you said)"No, Israel doesnt attack all the time, if there would be no attack from Palestines side, than IDF would not attack back."Their land? It's being taken by force as Israel continues to expand."    It is as much their land as K√∂nigsberg is Germanys land. They lost the war and have to accept the outcome, its your own fault if they cant."Their future? There is nothing.. western countries treat them as if they are people from no country because the they only recognize ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äù now.**"**They could have a big future, there were plans made and western countries pump much money in the Gaza strip, which gets stolen by Hamas. Goal was to make it like Monaco, which is a rich small state."Media coverage? Nope, nothing."Not true, it was not always in the focus but everyone in the world knows about the conflict and about the struggles of both sides."Other arabian countries helping them? Nope, the west controls these."Yes they dont help but not because they are controled by the west. Where is Iran controlled by the west? It is just simple, the leader of the arabian countries dont give a fuck about the Palestinians, they just use them as a tool for their own goals. Iran even will let them die just to get Israel in a bad light.
They had the footage of everything leading up to the killing so why didn‚Äôt they include the smoking gun of the body being dragged to this weapon that was clearly stated they didn‚Äôt have in the beginning?   I agree with dude‚Ä¶.we may never see real and unbiased news to make up our own minds ever again.
I guess the 724 children killed in Gaza were terrorists as well. You have the intelligence of a garbanzo bean.
Not at all especially when fighting people like hamas
Unarmed is generally a good indicator
How do you know they were civilians Hamas doesn't exactly have a uniform
They were unarmed civilians not soldiers or terrorists. Stop trying to justify dehumanization when you obviously didn‚Äôt watch the video. Gullible is a good name for you.
First they weren‚Äôt soldiers or terrorists they were unarmed civilians that followed orders.
Yeah all I learned is that your post must be satire or something
Deterrence.
Thanks. I'll go see if I can learn something
Yes, I know America has its share of radical christians that want armageddon. Obviously you are one of the believers in invisible gods that want death....
I believe they are so used to running back into their borders and no action taking because of the humanitarian issue civilians they weren‚Äôt expecting Israel to go all jihad also on them
You forgot the last sentence in the first part of the quote: because they would have all been genocided by Israel.
have you played so many computer war games you have lost all compassion for humans on both sides?
Really why sail to Middle East then?
They moved them there to do exactly that, I am just saying use them not to allow Israel to continue pure revenge, but to stop Israel  from proceeding and enraging the entire middle east..Can we not have compassion for the human loss, a large percentage children.. on both sides, from a larger war.
Can‚Äôt compare Hamas and IDF. Hamas started this knowing the outcome they chose to have their people in harms way. I don‚Äôt feel the same I‚Äôm pro Israel. Jews in modern time never do Jihads, suicide bombings, kill gays for sport, stone women  the list goes on. Anyone who‚Äôs with Islamic extremism or  anyone who sympathizes with Islamic extremist should be dust men, women and children.
Isreal kills Palestinians before that events already.Israel has control of most of gaza electricity,water and decide what enter to gaza and what not ,they are in prison.Israel never stops expanding their occupation although they signed agreement that it would it was 30 years ago.we are taking about people without hope ,can be kicked out of their home anytime and are already bombed.they are trying to survive.Now Israel cut off water,electricity and even prevent other countries to send medicines, medical help or food to gaza and it is killing civilians for days with no military goals to be targeted.Hamas isn‚Äôt even an official organization so what the point of what isreal is doing and how it is that easy for him to kill all this children, for me the answer is they simply don‚Äôt care as always. You can search what Israel was doing to Palestinians the last 70 years
its no wonder Antifa was seen at multiple rallies like this across the world
Hamas is not isis i hate this saying so much its stupid was the KKK and the Nazis ISIS as well? 2 different political opinons although they fall under the same religions are they a terrible people yes no doubt but they are far from isis
They don‚Äôt show this on the tv
Why would we want to stop Israel? I think your finger on the wrong pulse of what Americans are wanting....
Wtf did hamas expect after doing what they did. The Isrealis are out to utterly destroy them. Hamas kills women children and babies then expects to be treated like actual soldier. Get fucked Hamas.
Heart cells stimulate itself, they just need energy and oxygen for that, we can provide both without a body. Yes the heart is alive if you mean, the muscle cells are intact.
Religion is both an opiate to those terrified of the finality of death, and an excuse used to justify the some of the worst aspects of humanity.
Perhaps they are positioning for a wider war to involve more arab countries‚Ä¶
and who the fuck is Miles guo? and the NFSC?an exiled chinese billionaire fraudster...At the peak of his career, he was the 73rd richest person in China. Guo was accused of corruption and other misdeeds by the Chinese authorities and fled to the United States in late 2014, after learning he was going to be arrested under allegations of bribery, kidnapping, money laundering, fraud and rape.well sounds like he might have a thing or 2  in common with hamas to have such valuable intel
What we really need to do is reanimate the Neanderthal hominids, as home sapiens killed them off 30k years ago or so. They should get all the land, we have clearly fucked it up enough.
I think that was the prim motivation.
and how will hamas get to the golan heights?...just saunter across Israel? or take the long scenic route?
Ah yes they started the war by having 700+ civilians brutally massacred with rampant rapes  and atrocities, yea they started it !
Although Hamas is trying to eradicate the indigenous Jews. They‚Äôre essentially the Muslim KKK. An extremist group only adds fuel to the fire. Hamas knew they couldn‚Äôt win the war they started on the 7th. They wanted to make Israel look bad in both the security breach and the subsequent response. To the point where they tell citizens not to leave the war zone. But remember, this is on the people who ordered the killings and the people who pulled the trigger. No one else.
...and just imagine how Americans too would love to give the land back to the Natives...we stole it fair and square.but really...this tends to happen to conquered cultures
&gt;good luck finding a live one now
It was hyperbolic. A more accurate number might be millions of years ago.
Yep, it's mad how far leftists are siding with the extreme right
They stand zero chance. Isreal have a modern army with 300k troops.There's simply nothing they can do to repel them. Deter them, delay them, cause some casualties yes - but the writing is on the wall.
100s of millions eh... that's old... so these ppl were hanging with dinos.....
The issue is singularly complex.  My only solid takeaway, as a canadian with little to no actual experience with this conflict, is that,  colonialism inevitably creates an 'unwinnable' context for everyone involved.  That there is no win win solution in the aftermath of colonization.  I live in british columbia, a place where canada exists on literally stolen land.  There have never been treaties ceding land to canada here.  So by canadas own laws, much of the province's predominantly white population lives on land that legaly still belongs to first nations.  And while there is a reconciliation process, there remains a context here that will always be tenuous and frought with the trauma of a historical attempted genocide and the continued questions of who decides what happens and who lives on the land.  How does one reconcile the attempted eradication of a people on the land they have always existed on?  I think that you cant. I dont see this problem ever being fully reconciled and I feel similarly about the situation in palestine/israel.  There is no common understanding of these situations, only sides.  The colonizers and the colonized.  Colonization creates tenuous to impossible living situations for ever after...
Isn't it dumb though when the God of all three major Abraham ice religions is the same fucking God?God is just the excuse.  The real reason is power and greed.  Always has been.
Spelt it wrong, it's Lomekwi.
We are never really going to be able to know what is going on ever again. Too much fake propaganda to know whats what.
We need to give back all the land to the Natives in Canada too! They can run the country!
Google doesn't even know what a Lekemwi is.Is there a more common word for that?
Very good comment.  You realize how silly all of this is.  Unfortunately, many others do not.
Nah.
Eat a fat dick is what I would say to people that want women and children killed with no remorse. You're a hateful person and the hate in your heart will eventually kill you too
Shit looks like the purge out thereüò¨
Good luck trying to figure out a thousand(s) year tribal conflict over resources. Let me know when you figure it all out and let me know. Cheers.
Yeah I guess that's our only hope eh lol
Or their living conditions could be so bad they just said f- it.
Many of the people do. Free Palastine protests are happening in my country (in the west). Its funny to think that if those protestors were in the Israeli towns that got attacked they'd have been shot too. No side is the good side. Both civilian populations are brainwashed into hating the other and celebrating their deaths. Its insanity. There are lots of people on Reddit that need to generalise. I think about the Ukraine war, People talk about Russians like they are all evil (ignoring the freedom legion who are russians) and its the same here. A population twisted by decades of propaganda isn't inherently evil.
Of course, all the opinions are suppressed here. The social media keeps deleting posts defending Palestine to the point everyone is brainwashed. Palestinians don‚Äôt have any media advantages to communicate with the world. And even if they did, the west only cares about controlling the middle east so they wouldn‚Äôt do anything anyways. They already know but don‚Äôt care.
Hamas already putting out ied for the civilians so they can't leave
Yep it's sad but hamas started it
From what I've learned you are 100% correct. To me nothing excuses what has happened back then or whats happening now to innocent civilians. Both sides have done evil things but I don't think Hamas would exist if not for Israel. In a perfect world the US and the Arab nations would work together to fix this. Watch as I get called a bot or something
Yeah the pov gopro videos of hamas fighters gunning down civilians makes it hard to care
You might be failing to understand that everyone knows the reality, but nobody cares now. They lost public opinion when they revealed how brutally disgusting they are.And brutality begets brutality. Such as it has been since the first tribes of humanity.Not saying Isreal hasn't committed their own crimes. We all know they have. But if you are at the bottom of evil, stay the lesser evil.
That's awesome!  Thank you!
USA and the UN created Israel. They stand with israel to control the middle eastern area. It is a game of power, you remember what happened in Iraq when USA killed millions of people and lying saying Iraq has nuclear weapons? Same thing. The west controls the media.Here is why Palestinians attack back:- For years, Palestinians have been under relentless attack (as you said)- They're stripped of their basic rights.- Water, food, electricity? Controlled by Israel.- The average space that 16 Palestinians live in is what a person typically has elsewhere in the world!- Their religion and holy sites are mocked and disrespected right in front of them.- They're denied the right to defend themselves.- Their land? It's being taken by force as Israel continues to expand.- Their family? Lots of them were abused, kidnapped, or killed.- Their privacy? Israel soldiers go inside their houses by force regularly to check if they have anything- Their future? There is nothing.. western countries treat them as if they are people from no country because the they only recognize ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äù now.- Media coverage? Nope, nothing.- Other arabian countries helping them? Nope, the west controls these.In fact, Israel keeps expanding, and kicking the people out of their homes to Gaza. This is why it is so densely populated. Israel built towers, offered top education, gets billions in funding.. while palestiniand suffer behind a wall not being able to feed themselves or have a future.What did they expect? A peaceful agreement?
Doesn't really matter. If I knew my blood thirsty neighbor was going to break into my house, I might just let him so I can finally be secure.
Vote out all liberals (D) they are what‚Äôs wrong in our world. Liberals peddle hate, division, genocide, war, terror, inequality, racism, crime, paranoia, pandemics, communism, socialism (socialist workers party=nazis), ethnic conflict.
Israel has offered the Palestinians their own State in exchange for peace and have been turned down and instead attacked multiple times. Is Israel a saint in the picture. No but they have tried to have a peaceful existence yes. They radicals Arabs who don‚Äôt believe Israel doesn‚Äôt have a right to exist have answered any peace deal with NO the most notable one being No No No. No peace, No Israel, No negotiations ‚Ä¶ that is what Israel faces üòâ
How is everyone hating on Palestine sm when isreal  forced them from their homes to live in open air prisons in the middle of the desert for years
STOP AND THINK ABOUT ALL THE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT THE LEFT IS PART OF. Liberals are just as evil. Progressive-leftist, communist-Nazi devils. The world is on the brink. The world would be at pease without all of them.
[This](https://youtu.be/dEoVzKyD_IM?si=fIYitw4EoRa-43SP) is from 2yrs ago but is the history of the areaEdit: [here‚Äôs](https://youtu.be/pefEIwoTEnE?si=6R4VQh8teXLJPUcZ) a shorter one he posted today
Yeah, that's not a good idea.
It‚Äôs not their land! It‚Äôs the land of Moses, David, and Jesus. Not Muhammad!
Nobody wants these people because they are demons. Even Iran refuses these dogs of hell. Sorry, but the devil has many faces, and you mustn‚Äôt be fooled by temptation of selfishness and empathy. I‚Äôm Christian, and the Jewish tribe has every right to hit back at those who want to destroy them. Thousands of years of being bullied takes it toll. No more!
Okinawa and the massive US presence is a 90 min flight from Taipei.   So the answer is actually the US and the Japanese.  You can probably throw in the Filipinos and the Koreans.   And you have it exactly backwards on who is screwed when the west sanctions the F out of China the second they try this.   The west has been moving their supply chains out of China since they showed how unreliable they are during Covid.    China is utterly dependent on the wests markets for their economy.   They are also net importers of food and oil.   Good luck getting any of that though once the total blockade of everything going in and out of China gets enforced 10 seconds after they start any invasion. This is all a ridiculous scenario because it‚Äôs predicated that China could launch a successful invasion right now with out any build up.   Because you know any build up would be detected and countered with carrier  task forces moved into the area.     And before you start with some helicopter sneak attack scenario , you know the Taiwanese has a military right?
1. Hamas has proven many times over the years they DO NOT CARE about Palestinians. 2. Israel was in the process of a normalization pact with Saudi Arabia. This would have severely hurt Hamas. With the conflict initiated the pact has been put on hold and is looking like it may not happen now. 3. Hamas simply want the death and destruction and enslavement of anyone who isn‚Äôt radical Islam. They hate the west and want to destroy us and are willing to die and meet their god and get their virgins for doing it. 4.Reports are coming in of explosions killing refugees Hamas instantly blamed israel strikes. While Israel denies a strike n the area, they also flame to have seen video of the explosion that appeared to come up from underneath the road. While I have a healthy distrust for any state sponsored media. Hamas is a terrorist group ied‚Äôs causing fear and blaming other people for it and killing your own citizens to accomplish your goal Al Tracy with a terrorist cells MO
Temple of the mount sits on the ruins of King David‚Äôs palace on top of Mt. Zion. In my opinion the mount rightfully belongs to the tribe of King David, or Israel. Unimaginable power belongs to those who possess it. This, to me, means that as long as the devils of Islam occupy gods mountain in gods city, they will possess amazing power over the people. Zion is the gate, or portal of unknown powers. This is why it hasn‚Äôt been taken already. Not to mention, that taking from Islam might destroy all of us.
Animals that are doing this for reasons that are within the bounds of species and animal instinct is not the same as someone doing it out of cruelty, though. It is not possible for a cat to tie up a bunch of babies into a plastic bag and discard them. I see your point about nature doing this, but humans are the only species that would do this purely out of cruelty with no other intent other than to kill the other species either by suffocation or to be crushed by a machine is an entirely different situation.
Just so we are clear. You are suggesting the US uses its military might to intervene in a ME conflict?
Or the US could stand by and let Isreal and Palestine readjust their population with Isreal eventually destroying Palestine and the Jews have what they want and the world is 2- 3,000,000 less.
In the end game it‚Äôs the Bric nations trying to unseat the USD.  That‚Äôs why there is all the chaos going on.  It‚Äôs a diversion
Yes
50+ and lived there for a bit. It‚Äôs amazing what they can do when they put their mind to it.  You mis understood.  Who is going to save Taiwan within a 2 hr radius if China chose to go completely stupid and invaded tomorrow.  The answer is no one.  My guess is China would have control of the outlying area of the island within 6-10 hrs and there isn‚Äôt anything we‚Äôll be able to do about it.  Try to help and it‚Äôs ww3.   Think if China closes their trade with us.  We‚Äôd be F‚Äôd 6 ways to Sunday.
Israel repeatedly caused conflicts, committed atrocities, and murdered thousands for years.?
The Jews lived on this land for thousands of years and have fought for peace for years and the radicals have responded with no no no and education is wasted on hatefulled radicals. The Peace pacts that have been offered to the Palestinians have been responded to with bullets and rockets. I have lived thru 67 years of this history.
They lost a war. Their are consequences to losing a war.
No offence here but how old are you?Your belief that china could pull off a successful invasion of Taiwan with two hours notice makes me assume you must be 12.
They killed the commanders that led the strike at the rave.
They are all little boy lovers.
Repost of kwak shit
first they're not soldiers, they're terrorist's... so rules of war don't apply. and after committing the acts they had just done...do you think any soldier they try to surrender too would have any mercy. im sure the army has been given instructions to show no quarter. and they didn't...sucks to be a terrorist.and of course this comes from al jazeera...no bias there
Everyone in Hamas was like one of those kids who lost their families by the Israeli attacks from 75 years ago till today. They got the full right to fight back.You can‚Äôt blame someone for trying to get their land, their dignity and their basic human rights.
Palestinians deserve their land. They don‚Äôt even want to be relocated. It‚Äôs not about Egypt not wanting to help because we know quite well what Egypt has provided through the decades to Palestine and to fight Zionism.This is what israel wants. Pressuring my country to accommodate Palestinians and relocate them to sinai because of the ongoing ethnic cleansing and war crimes committed by the colonization for DECADES cannot stand up to logical scrutiny
wow okay so you‚Äôre either rage baiting or you‚Äôre a literal sociopath and i refuse to deal with either. hope you can get your life together and stop viewing the world with such a shitty lense.
Noted. Kill them first then flush them down the toilet like God intended lol. Would never want to abuse potential pests because they are just so cute. Should I use poison or just snap their necks like we do with rats? What I find crazy about all of this is the need to care about them yet having no care for actual people.
Both sides are trying to commit genocide. I'm not sure who the fuck I'm supposed to support here.
Google translate is a thing.   I will hold my breath.
Do you ever practice sarcasm in Palestine?
no, because those are not clear acts of cruelty. hunting is about conservation and there is no cruelty in that act when following hunting rules. fish are mostly flushed when dead, again no cruelty. putting live kittens into a bag and throwing it away to be sent to god knows where is cruelty and is therefore abuse.
Crazy how a person like that is in government.
America has pedophiles china has pedophiles brazil and i swear in every country there is pedophiles but they dont represent their country
They are not! Ofcourse there are pedophiles everywhere but they dont represent there countries, palestine is a muslim country some of them not but most of them yes and Islam has strict rules on pedophilia , i dont say none of them are bad but most of them arent
You haven‚Äôt got the new chip implanted yet . It‚Äôs awesome
I have proofs that all of Palestine is pedophiles. I swear, I have proof. I will get back to you, please believe me.
We‚Äôll see what happens.  Who‚Äôs  in the area right now that could aid Taiwan ( within say 2hrs)  if China invaded today?   Answer: no one!
I agree. It should be given back to Rome. Or at least UK. But I don't think anyone wants it back.
Its ok dont believe me even if i have proofs
The proof is that you made it up.
But its alright go follow the flock
Yeah man because you are afraid of being wrong, i wanted to show you the proofs of what is happening in gaza with all these kids and what are isreal lying about
You might enjoy looking at pics and vids of death and destruction but I‚Äôm good, I don‚Äôt need to see it.
And they took 3+ years of build up to do it.   And weren‚Äôt facing the US navy and all the technology that their opponents have.   Go have a look at how many actual landing areas there are in Taiwan and understand the Taiwanese have been fortifying them since 1947.   Go back to you action movies an video games.   Your ignorance is appalling.
I need to show you the pictures
Jesus Christ dude I want you to reply to my comment but fine I‚Äôll message you.
I dont see you on my message request yet, what about you give me your account on instagram
Are you saying that all civilians in gaza are justified military targets. Do you feel the same way about Israel. That all isrealis are culpable for the IDF strikes therefore there are no isreali civilians as well, this would actually make more sense because almost all isrealis are part of the compulsory military sevice. So all hamas targets are justified military actions as well?
Oh im here, I‚Äôll debate you whenever you want.
I left a comment on one of your previous comments.
took the words out of my mouth. Putin cares about civilians? much less foreign civilians üòÇ okayyy
The Brit‚Äôs did it in Normandy 70 years ago.  They had no technology, further to go across.   All I‚Äôm saying is if China wanted to go,  they would have a pretty good handle on it before we even knew what was going on.    It‚Äôs not just landing crafts,  paratroops, choppas( Arnold voice), Planes, and some old fashioned communication and radar jamming
Hmm i see that you are afraid to come and text me! COME IF YOU THINK YOU ARE RIGHT
Sorry man but you are the one who need the education, palestine was a free country until Zionists came and stole their lands. If i stole your house and offer you a piece of it are you going to accept it or just give up like a chicken huh?üòâ
Problem is China is imploding quietly right now. They are stretched thinner that the United States.
I am waiting for someone to translate it i promise you i will get back once i have it
Do you have any education on the History of the area? Do you have any education on the World recognizing the need for two separate States? Peel Commission ring a bell? Israelis offering Palestinians their own land for their own State for peace? Look up No No No ‚Ä¶.education is your friend üòâ
Post it all here. The world needs to see it....allThe civilian population will continue to pay a heavy price . Some are completely against hamas ,some are ardent supporters . This fight is what hamas wants. It wants to show the world all the poor civilians it holds hostage as well dieing  en mass. Is it right ...no ...is it ugly.....yes. will it continue...yes. hamas knew that as well when they openly attacked  civilians and took hostages inside Israel. So hell being visited upon gaza is a direct reaction to their attack on Isreal.  Don't like it, blame hamas.  Power is cut , water is cut , fuel is cut. Most communications are cut. Civilians are suffering . Remember, communications are cut. Isreal rules the airwaves....all of them. Uhf, Vhf ,satellite all cellular.  Encrypted apps are no longer Encrypted.  So, any civilian casualties are probably due to hamas setting up command and control in civilian held areas. They have every bit of Metadata of the planner, supporters, and those that aid hamas. Will there be errors in bombing . Yes, most likely . Those know ip addresses and cell signals will be targeted . The murderous terrorists  are to blame . Not israel. Hamas has also stolen cell phones from residents to cover their tracks. Those cell phones are tracked to their most prominent used area . Another way leading to civilians being targeted.   Point is had hamas not undertaken its murder , rape, hostage taking spree none of this would happened.  The  posting of civilian casualties you have will help the world understand the true cost of terrorism.  Post away. Perhaps other nations who support hamas will see what happens and decide not to partake in terrorism.  Iran is a big supporter they will gladly fight til the last Palestinian. With hamas out of the way, maybe some real negotiations about a Palestinian state can take place.  They always threatened any negotiations with Israel with terrorists actions.  Without them, perhaps fatah and other Arab nations with the US and Israel could have come to an agreement about a Palestinian state. True peace is what's needed. At some point, the multigenerational hate has to stop . Take a chance on each other . Build some trust .terrorism  just recycles violence and death. May your photos of gaza and this conflict be some of last civilian casualty photos the world ever sees.
Lol.   So China is going to whip up a massive invasion fleet and mass the equipment and manpower to load on it and get all that across the Taiwan straight before we even notice?Cool story bro.  You should transfer all your assets into yuan immediately.   You have it all figured out.
Yea
How many times did you hear about Gaza ‚Äú civilians ‚Äú standing up and fighting hamas? üòÇ They protect them, give them places to hide, give them money.
Write it without this ()
They won‚Äôt run out of money, we‚Äôll just print some more which weakens the USD.  The end game is to get the world off of the USD.   China has the capability, the man power and the weapons to get across the Taiwan straight before we even knew what hit them.
Where are you? There is no message request
Oh i didnt notice that you texted me dont worry i will come now
They don‚Äôt have a snowballs chance in hell to put up a toe to toe fight
Lol üòÇ and you won‚Äôt reply to my earlier comment cause you know you‚Äôre wrong dude.
I promise i will but wait for me so i can translate the story
I would like to know when and how Israel started this war.   Can you help me with that?
That hamas attacked isreal? It's in every single news outlet. Which one do you trust and I'll send a link from them.
Its not okay but who started it first?? And hammas didnt kill any children or women! and i have a proof
And what about the men, women, and children killed by hamas? Was that ok?
Hmmm why dont you come to text me on my instagram account and ill show you what are they doing to people in gaza?.My account name is (sachi_jo6)
They probably throwing rocks, and in ten years time probably launching rockets. Why is he still breathing?
You blame hammas for what? Isreal started the war and hammas wanted to get revenge hammas want to take isreal down after what isreal did to their families and homes
Yeah. At least he's being arrested, not shot and beheaded. Or raped.
I blame Hamas for all of this. Hamas unleashed a mad dog upon its own people
Okay dude but you are objectively wrong here. Of course there is going to be deaths on both sides, that‚Äôs just how war works. However what hamas did over the past weekend were literally war crimes and acts of terrorism doesn‚Äôt matter how you want to look at it. Doesn‚Äôt matter if hamas genuinely is fighting for the Palestinian people or not, that‚Äôs not how you go about it. What they did was absolutely barbaric and Hamas does not represent real Palestinian people cause no one in the right mind among the common folk of any country or culture would call for the rape and murder of innocent civilians. Doesn‚Äôt matter if they‚Äôve been launching bombs at each other for years or not doesn‚Äôt matter what issues they have with Israel‚Äôs government, you keep fucking innocent civilians out of it, period. Additionally, no Israel has not launched as many rockets at Gaza. Gaza has launched far more and killed far more people in those exchanges over the years. Not sure what sources you are using that tell you otherwise but do more research on the whole thing cause you clearly don‚Äôt know about the history behind this conflict whatsoever because people that actually know the history behind don‚Äôt pick sides at all. Cause neither side is right or wrong. What is objectively wrong though is what Hamas did over the past weekend, that was a deliberate terrorist attack and that‚Äôs why they are getting the full force right now just like any other country would react too.
If you think the US is about to run out of money or weapons you are seriously deluded.   Ukraine has unified and regularized the west and NATO and is seriously weakening Russian military power.  This mess in the Middle East is just the latest, albeit really terrible, round of conflict. China isn‚Äôt going to invade Taiwan.   Firstly they simply do not have the capability to successfully pull off an invasion that size and secondly Ukraine has shown them all it will do is unify the west against them.
i go into the link and it's still available i will sent it dm to you again
Bomb them back to the stone age
Europe doesn't want them.
yeah, because my evidence done by NATO is "biased" or some shit.
If Palestine had taken a peace deal at least they could have a starting point to work from... and most importantly peace. If you focus on peace, that's the way to go brother.
Learn English...Israel dropped about 800 bombs COMPARED to Hamas's 5,000 rockets, which is very little.
Oh so this what are you believing?üòÇüòÇ man i promise you at the end you will see who is right and that time you are going to cry for how dumb you were (i promise)
I agree you have your points... and I agree Israel hasn't been fair... but at the end of the day Palestine lost the war. It sucks but that's history. Story as old as time. Take a peace deal and then work from there.
ALMOST NO BOMBS???? Man i swear you are brainwashed i have a lot of proofs that they are dropping bombs all over gaza!!! Thank god i dont believe the media like you
Sounds like more graves
He seems to absolutely love war and killing as many ppl as possible. He's a nut. I'm a Republican too btw.
I think religion is just the overlay to a tribal resource conflict... without religion it would still be happening.
I am a conservative voter and these neo cons have gone fucking insane. Human beings are too emotional for the technology we have invented. Our brains are not evolving at a pace that can keep up.
Here is a write up from STratcomecoe, used by NATO   [https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/hamas\_human\_shields.pdf](https://stratcomcoe.org/cuploads/pfiles/hamas_human_shields.pdf)  have fun looking dumb
Yeah the goal is to start a bigger war in the region... pull the US in.... then China can move on Taiwan.

What is Bullshit? You cry about bombs that hit Hamas and are directed at Hamas, but do you put into perspective the tens of thousands of rockets from Gaza that have repeatedly caused dead civilians in front of the Iron Dome? Israel has dropped almost no bombs compared to Hamas rockets because they want to hit as few civilians as possible. Gaza should finally remove Hamas from Gaza then the people there will soon be free.
I am sure your home this present day was on another people‚Äôs land . So get out and give them there land back , hypocrite
I‚Äôll send it off the IDF commanders right this instant.
You know what is going to come with flattening the cities right , a lot of collateral damage, a lot of innocent deaths , and only going to create more people willing to fight for Hamas .
What‚Äôs your point?
No, this is deeper than even land. It‚Äôs hate for a people.
I think they should all sit down...AND LISTEN TO THE NEW APHEX TWIN ALBUM
Speak for yourself
Speak for yourself
If Iran did not fund this . Then they used funds given from United States. Cut off all U. S  aide to Palestine . Put to a vote during next election. Let the people decide, not congress
Remove the your moral compass and view of the world.  Hamas celebrate any death of a Jewish person, and they achieved that goal by a long shot.
Bullshit
And the 5,000 rockets this week and the tens of thousands in the last few years and recurring terrorist attacks will not be responsible for this. Or?
Lol, ever seen what cats do to other species? They play with them and watch them die slowly by ripping off their wings, or paralyzing them with a few tosses.

My ancestors haven‚Äôt been kicked out of 108 countries. In point of fact, we haven‚Äôt even been kicked out of one.

Exactly
lol. But don‚Äôt given weapons to Ukraine
Republican hear saying we don‚Äôt accept Lindsay graham . He‚Äôs a circus act .
ISIS = Hamas = Russia regime = Iran regime
It is reported that the Israeli ground offensive into Gaza will be delayed by a few days due to heavy rain and clouds, so the trick 1 maybe cracked.  But what should be done to crack the next tricks?
In any normal country Hamas would be considered a political party, but the west and Israel call them terrorists because they don‚Äôt want them to have international support
Israel is going to come out of this more hated than ever. Hamas is already winning.Saudi‚Äôs dropped out of talks. Most people think Israel is committing war crimes and genocide. US is seen as hypocritical for supporting residential razing.Hook line and sinker.
Where do you think are Hamas‚Äôs family? Hamas are obviously Palestinian men that chose to fight back. Hamas is not the US, they are not a country, and all their gains are gaining their land back. But because the west supports Israel they call it a ‚Äúterrorist group‚Äù instead of actually giving the palestinians their rights.
Yes. Their friend ‚ÄúIran‚Äù is trying to push Israel to the breaking point so they can save face. Hamas is willing to sacrifice THEIR OWN PEOPLE to accomplish this.Either way I do not support how harsh this war is about to get. I feel sorry for dead innocents no matter where and it‚Äôs actually depressing.
Yes! People have no justification, they will just downvote and run away.
It‚Äôs about the BRIC‚Äôs countries trying to take over.  It‚Äôs about getting the world off the USD! 1. Russia starts a war with Ukraine for what amounts to nothing,  the US throws money and weapons at Ukraine2. Iran starts a proxy war in Israel using Hamas,  the US throws weapons and money at Israel. 3. US is stretched thin on Money, Weapons, and low reserves in the strategic oil reserves.4. Now if you‚Äôre Z in China, you have a weak US president with low money, low oil, low weapons, now it‚Äôs time to take Taiwan back.
I pray they are not
Sympathy enough to feel justified.
I‚Äôm crying so hard ..  I can‚Äôt believe this craziness
Saudis we‚Äôre going to normalize relations with Israel. The attack throws that relationship in question. https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-puts-israel-deal-ice-amid-war-engages-with-iran-sources-say-2023-10-13/
The Mediterranean Sea?
Amazing how nothing is changed since our misguided invasions after 9/11.  Still a bunch of emotional tiny dick reactionaries running the country and trying to get us involved in protracted wars that have nothing to do with the US.  Religion is a curse.
not my proudest nut
The Israeli army has committed 1000 times more killings and destruction in retaliation to the attacks. They are deliberately targeting innocent civilians including children. They are collectively punishing all the Palestinians. How will that solve anything? This is all to steal even more land from the Palestinians and to ethnically cleanse them off. This is genocide. The entire world is watching the horrendous massacre of innocent civilians.
Saudis should go ahead with the peace deal regardless to show strength. But we know that's not how it works haha. They already put it on hold.
You're correct. Many other countries would take them in but the point is that they shouldn't have to leave their own country just to appease a terrorist organization that is hell-bent on their total annihilation. But also, the innocent Palestinian citizens should be allowed to live in peace, but that will not happen as long as Hamas is in power. They are the ones who have vehemently rejected the idea of a 2-party state. The average Palestinian citizen does not want them there but unfortunately many have been radicalized beyond hope.
I mean... if you're looking for some pros... Also obviously I'm joking about the nazi thing
Still no excuse for the way hamas has acted and now they will pay the price because the whole world can be brought to tears by the acts they have committed and now innocent people will pay the price. If that would have happened anywhere in America we would not have needed the military to handle it. I understand both sides of the story are probably skewed but its u forgivable and and as bad as I hate to say it Palestine has put themselves in a position where people that could care less are suddenly fighting mad at them. Palestine has let hamas direct the worlds anger at them.
So you're saying Hamas DIDN'T cross the border and gun down families hiding in their homes as well as gun down all those men and women (teenagers) at the music festival? You claim there are no videos when there are multiple videos proving the atrocities. Or maybe it's all just the "propaganda" which I previously mentioned? Maybe those videos are "doctored"?
Gaza is an open air prison. From way before this conflict even happened. Israel locked almost 2 million people in a city with no way in or out. I can‚Äôt understand how it‚Äôs so hard for people to justify that simple fact. How do you expect the people of Gaza and Palestine to react to being treated inhumanly for the past 80 years under brutal military Israeli occupation?
That is what they have been trying to do for the past 80 years. This was not unprovoked. As long as the Zionist continues the illegal occupation of the land while inflicting violence and unequal rights. There will always be resistance.
And they aren‚Äôt under occupation hamas leaders have the money to make Gaza bigger and better that Tel Aviv and what do they spend their money on?? Certainly not health and safety or clean water or energy. But they damn sure take the aid given to the people and sell it on the black market cause I can go buy that shit right now. Only terrorists put rockets on top of civilian buildings hoping to detour attack
Bring your problems to the table don‚Äôt drop in on innocent people and kill people hiding in the port a John you can defend it all you want but I‚Äôve seen the videos of the children being taught in school that‚Äôs it‚Äôs okay to treat Jews that way that it‚Äôs okay to stab and run over Jews
That is the root of the issue. Hamas are a group of resistant fighters who are fighting for the freedom and liberation of the indigenous people of Palestine. The Racist Israeli Zionist want to kill every Palestinian, Christian or Muslim or anyone who sympathizes with the Palestinians. For the last 80 years Palestine has been under brutal and barbaric Israeli occupation. The dog will eventually be the one to bite back and attack when he has abused and locked in a cage for so long once he is finally out!
Yeah just let the keep their land so they can keep attacking and playing the victim for years to come
Dont cry now that the camel fukers started the war, Palestinians will have a slow death now getting bombed until no one of them is left alive congratulations
If somebody came into your neighborhood and treated everyone you know the way hamas treated the Israelites you would be pissed too. You can‚Äôt bite the hand that feeds you and not get smacked
You all forget. If NATO pulls it weight and doesn‚Äôt let the US shoulder all the burden that it will be a hard pill to swallow for any country not allied with the west
Bigger global players here than just Israel &amp; Hamas. Iran helped plan &amp; fund this attack &amp; has the most obvious motive as it certainly wants to derail the current process of normalization of Saudi &amp; Israeli relations but moreover a bunch of bigger players like China (in respect to Taiwan), Russia (in respect to Ukraine), &amp; N Korea (in respect to S Korea) all benefit from the world‚Äôs attention (as well as the United States aid $ &amp; carrier strike groups) being distracted by what‚Äôs going on in Gaza.

I‚Äôd gladly go stand side by side with the Israelites and pound the Palestinians into the dirt. This isn‚Äôt grown men with beliefs this is a whole country with a sick mentality that even the children are brainwashed into thinking they have ti stab and run Jews over with cars and be suicide bombers. It‚Äôs sad but it‚Äôs a necessity to rid our world of such violence. Makes me fuckin sick
Not hard to imagine that you haven‚Äôt drawn the correlation between the failed exit in Afghanistan and a terrible deal with Iran. Yes Biden has worked to destabilize the world with his terrible policy and his weakness. Biden‚Äôs terrible body of work has nothing to do with Trump, Biden and his team have made their own mess. Funny enough during Trumps presidency him and his team did more for Israel than almost any other President. Just cause you hate Trump doesn‚Äôt mean Biden is doing a good job. You should open your eyes to what is happening around the world and in our country. Trump is accountable for his mistakes but this is a ‚Äòthis administration‚Äô issue. Stop comparing and start evaluating. Unfortunately, you may have just as narrow viewpoint of the world as hamas, and that‚Äôs NOT a compliment or a good thing!
We prevent gencide... why? Lol
why dont jews just move to any other welcoming country other than arabs no arab welcome them here like wtf how about europe or usa
bruh i am sorry is hamas an army for you they only use missles so far just to attack enemy bases and they save attacked civilians like children and women cause thats the human thing to do
üáÆüá±üê∑
If you praise your God during the kidnapping, rape, murder, burning, and beheading of children, you might need to think about why you're fighting.
Those guys thought that was their ticket to paradise.And it will hopefully create a big chain reaction where others do the same.Humans are apes. We are ignorant, frightened and trying to make sense of the world. It should be beyond obvious that Islam or any other religion  doesn't provide the best way to do that.At the base level - we are fighting a war of ideas.
So what happened to the rest of the family, I would assume they are also dead?
WTF people! Even one single decapitated baby is enough for people to say "Fuck Hamas, kill 'em all"!Pure Fucking Evil!!!
So you would have the rest of the free world back Hamas in the complete annihilation of all Jews from the face of the earth? (It's in their charter). But that's fine because obviously all Jews are adult military males and there are absolutely no Jewish children, women, elderly that exist so it's completely sane to suggest this.
I have seen other notable people talk about this too. Holy shit, it is super suspicious. How, at the very least, was there not an immediate response as soon as Hamas crossed the border? 4 fuking hours?!?!?! side note: There was 1 tank that arrived at the music festival massacre, I don't know when it arrived, but it obviously didnt deter Hamas enough. Where the heck was the IDF? goddamm this world
Hamas doesn‚Äôt care about the Palestinians but uses them to justify their actions.  It‚Äôs a proxy war for Iran/Hamas, just like the US is using Ukraine to do their dirty work against Russia.
Typed this before I saw the comments.  This is the correct answer.  They answer to their masters in Iran.  It‚Äôs üíØ strategic.
"Having a heart and being a decent human being"???So even though Hamas is intent on wiping ALL JEWS from the face of the earth, wether they are mothers, fathers, children, sisters, brothers, babies, toddlers, teenagers, elderly, it doesn't matter to them...but you still defend them?Granted, there are atrocities on both sides and I truly hope all parties responsible will be held accountable under the Geneva convention guidelines but I think there is a lesser evil and a greater evil in this neverending conflict...Unfortunately propaganda will be the determining factor.
They have no intention of winning.  Their goal is to push Israel to cross a red line in Muslim world so Saudi Arabia can‚Äôt sign a treaty.  Death toll on either side doesn‚Äôt matter.  Hamas is evil incarnate..:
When I was around 10, I had a similar experience with kittens, but I was expressedly banned from touching or interacting with them. I still feel guilty to this day for not doing anything. Fuck those adults , man.
Just remember who in the background is behind all of this.While the US funds Iran, yet supports Israel. Between the lines
Of course it's not okay. But how do you want to take action against Hamas when they use civilians as a protective shield and sometimes do so out of conviction because Hamas propaganda has taught them since the first day of life, we're cool, it's cool for 72 virgins to play the martyr. It's almost impossible to tell who belongs to Hamas, who is a sleeper and who is just a civilian. You are welcome to suggest to me a better and more humane strategy that will end the terror, the probability that a different approach is compatible with Hamas' ideology is close to 0%.
Iran wants more, they want an all out war in the region
Russia can't do shit, they are over the heads in Ukraine and buy drones from Iran - what would they have to offer besides hit air?Do you really think Xi would step in and risk Chinese blood for Iran? - seriously?
Not trying to be too critical toward you but which livestream? / who runs it? It‚Äôs an odd thing happening there, that‚Äôs for sure.It doesn‚Äôt look like a compression artifact as far as I can tell, but perhaps it is.
How ironic that these people learned nothing but hate from the nazis. Smh
Actually, you don't remember anything. If so, show the source.
I found this really helpful to understand the context of what's going on:https://youtu.be/wQmBsbt9blg?feature=shared
It is also about preventing peace between Arab countries like Saudi and Israel. The potential for that peace deal could pave a way for other Arab countries to do the same. That would end all of Irans influence, simultaneously ending Palestine as well.
What did those scum gained from hurting children
Isreal would gladly bomb the human shields to get to Hamas
But I can beat to it
Bruh...wow
@ dev-engineer, your reply has just perfectly summed up the whole shit storm the Palestinians have had to put up with since the British screwed things up üëèüáµüá∏‚ù§Ô∏è

I remember when hamas did that. Didn't see gaza civilians do it though
Remember what Jesus said. When they kill your kid you kill 10 of theirs.  #heisrisin
Palestine had less than 8% jews in its‚Äô population in the past.  But because the jews were so hated in Europe, they started to come to Palestine and actually palestinians welcomed them. But their numbers increased from 50,000 to a stunning 250,000 by year 1939. Almost 50% of the new comers coming from Europe.They started buying land and expanding‚Ä¶ andThe British wanted to make a state for them and they decided to make it in Palestine‚Ä¶ Yes you heard that right, they wanted to make a state called Israel in a country that doesn‚Äôt belong to them! At first when Palestinians were annoyed of their numbers, the british limited their immigration, but tens of thousands came illegally anyways between WW1 and WW2.And then a new resistance was born.. HAMAS.Israel is recognized by the UN, and it is the west‚Äôs perfect country because they are not muslims. Empowering them in the middle east area is America‚Äôs dream to control the middle east.Palestinians get constantly attacked and their water, electricity, and resources are controlled by israel. People in Aqsa mosque get regularly abused and their religion mocked while they can‚Äôt do anything because israel soldiers have the weapons, but the palestinians only can throw rocks.The average conflict usually caused 100+ palestinian deaths for every 1 israeli death. The west doesn‚Äôt care because they only care about themselves. This is why as you see once Israel was the one that got attacked they panicked and called the palestinians terrorists.Gaza was bombed in 2 weeks the same amount USA bombed Afghanistan in A YEAR! They used banned chemicals but the west doesn‚Äôt care, however when Putin does it they call him a criminal‚Ä¶Your question is: why did they attack?The answer:- For years, Palestinians have been under relentless attackHere is- They're stripped of their basic rights.- Water, food, electricity? Controlled by Israel.- The average space that 16 Palestinians live in is what a person typically has elsewhere in the world!- Their religion and holy sites are mocked and disrespected right in front of them.- They're denied the right to defend themselves.- Their land? It's being taken by force as Israel continues to expand.- Their family? Lots of them were abused, kidnapped, or killed.- Their privacy? Israel soldiers go inside their houses by force regularly to check if they have anything- Their future? There is nothing.. western countries treat them as if they are people from no country because the they only recognize ‚ÄúIsrael‚Äù now.- Media coverage? Nope, nothing.- Other arabian countries helping them? Nope, the west controls these.Short answer: THEY ARE NOT LOSING ANYTHING, THEY ALREADY HAVE NOTHING. In fact, in islam if you die defending your religion, land, and family you don‚Äôt get judged. They have a strong belief Israelis simply don‚Äôt have. And they are 10x more courageous because of that. This is why Israel is struggling with them. Even if Israel does a ground attack, they will be welcomed with people that have zero fear, 100% revenge in their blood, and 100% belief to take as many soldiers with them as possible while dying.Lastly: Checkout this arabic wiki (use google translate):https://ar.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%85%D8%A9_%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%B2%D8%B1_%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9_%D9%81%D9%8A_%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%86(Note: They deleted the entries, so i had to get it from the web history.)
I think it‚Äôs all a matter of perception. If a army of a country bombed my home and I survived but my wife and son didn‚Äôt, well that‚Äôs the day I become a terrorist to that country. I would not care if I died. So ultimately I think this has just been a tit for tat endless cycle of violence that will only stop through Forgiveness.  This is resentment built up over thousands of years

Inbred Palestinians. They deserve the worst that can be offered from mankind
That‚Äôs true ! This just makes it easier for them to justify violence against Palestine. Maybe that‚Äôs what the Hamas was going for victimization of Palestine and western dollars?
Honestly I ask myself what Israel thought was going to happen. This promotes both side‚Äôs political agenda.
Imagine what Israel for tucked
They knew they would be flattened, i think its more about causing instability in the area and trying to get other countries involved such as Iran and the US.
Honestly, terrorism.... To inflict terror. Its beyond what reasonable human beings can comprehend. From my understanding; this is jihad. They've convinced themselves to appease "Allah" they must wage war on "infidels". Its been like this for over a thousand years. Groups of secular Islamist have been waging terror against any group who have even minor dissimilar belief. However in their mind; glory and 72 virgins await them. I know it sounds stupid but it is what it is.
You're not wrong. The British had a lot to do with this conflict during the early 20th century.
I think they were trying to derail the peace agreements that were in progress
Having to listen to that whiny, neurotic little bitch is graphic enough ü§£ü§£ü§£
Thank you for trying to keep biases out! In a time we‚Äôre there is so much misinformation, this means a lot.
Oi Vey goy, we accept the gays and treat everyone roight! As long as they aren't Palestinian children!
Not to mention the waves coming in from the South border. I think setting up on the US for a coordinated time attack
Wow
Hamas are a bunch of loudmouth A$$holes.
No shit they have clubs and party's there for it
Palestine deserves everything coming at them
Because predicting top secret Hamas attacks is not what Google AI does, or even have access to all the information to predict this. Bigger question is, why Mossad didn't see this coming. They tap into phones and have operatives on the ground even. And predicting Mossad actions is one of their core tasks.
they took down the vid, can you forward it to me
Flatten Gaza. Make it desert again and send the people to Europe
Biden is weak so they might actually go for it. Like him or hate him, this wouldn‚Äôt happen if Trump was in office.
Neither Egypt, Jordan, or Lebanon want refugees as in the past Palestinian refugees came with sone terrorist members who created civil wars in those countries. Look at the history of Jordan in the 70‚Äôs and Lebanon in the 80‚Äôs along with the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt. It‚Äôs a terrible shame for the everyday Palestinian, but the truth is that no middle eastern countries want Hamas members in their own countries.
Bro that looks just like mine, we‚Äòre twinning
Some ppl have lost their minds. It shows you we haven't evolved our brains past our "ape" impulses of blood lust. We are tribalizing for sure now too.
Truth what makes first World countrys safe there's Cleary heaps of Hamas supporters everywhere in the world
I support neither but I definitely won‚Äôt agree to going into ppls homes burning babies and killing civilians
Thank you for this
So it‚Äôs ok to kill kids Go house to house and murder civilians Got it
Iran has a long history of making a lot of noise and do nothing to help their allies. They don‚Äôt even like Hamas, since they are Sunnis and Iran is Shia. They are just giving them a bit of money to fight the hated Israel and USA, but if it doesn‚Äôt work out, ohh well.
Fuck them pali blocks up
Not happening
US can't do much with no Speaker.
A 75-year-old genocide that started with a direct declaration of war by the Arab League? what continues to this day? Everyone always writes that Israel is bombing the Gaza Strip. How many rockets, bombers and assassins have fired on Israel in the same period? Hamas currently only wants war because Israel has begun to negotiate a peace course with the Arab League and to strengthen Russia. Gaza will pay a high price for the leaders of the Gaza Strip to continue living in golden palaces in Qatar.
Go be gay in Israel. They still don‚Äôt like you
Posted with footage if you care to actually educated yourself  r/combatfootage with show your saints of jihad. ‚ÄúIAF footage showing Hamas deliberately setting up blockades blocking Gaza citizens trying to flee south in humanitarian corridors‚Äù We send money to isreal for the same reason we send money to a lot of country‚Äôs. To fight terrorist of jihad. Also we‚Äôre not even being in the fact that hamas is also partnered with another terror organization call hezbula. They aren‚Äôt Palestinians but just can‚Äôt stay away from a good jihad hit bed. Go play video games or somthing. This site is for adults that don‚Äôt support terrorist.
Isreal gets their own money idiot... Leviathan and Tamar do your fucking research, oh wait you can't because you are an oppressed terrorist... oh wow that's an oxymoron! Oppressed Terrorist hahahaha its an oxymoron because terrorism can never be justified... so, in other words terrorist can't be oppressed.
Hamas is a terrorist organization backed by Iran... And the whole Israeli regime is backed by USA! You went out to 4 deployments.. why does the US give $3.8 billion to Israel (this just in 2023)??Defending and retaliation is not terrorism.
Believe tv? I spent 4 deployments fighting these jihad fucks. Hamas is a terror organization back by Iran. If your dumbass could read you‚Äôd see I say I feel for actually innocent Palestinians and things that have happened to them but now they harbor jihad. How man roof knocks has hamas done? The IDF has literally called buildings to tell them they will be bombed and to evacuate. YOU watch tv. I lived it. And as far as how your talking you should go to Palestine and grab and AK and die with the terrorist you care about so much.
I myself witnessed this more than 20 times. I saw a mother and child approach our unit we yelled and yelled for them to stop at which point the child started running toward us where he was remotely detonated. Thank god for my k9‚Äôs storm vest as he took 4 pieces of shrapnel right to his side. I‚Äôve seen jihad I‚Äôve seen basicly comrades of hamas kill my friends in front of me. I feel for all I ice the people caught in the cross fire but I‚Äôll never give an inch of care to these jihad terrorist.
Yeah ... Why does the US kiss Israel's ass? That's my question ü§î
I could cite you all the info but like I said, I'm not your teacher. Do your own research, come to your own conclusion, and don't believe TV so much... Simple as that.If you like citations so much... here's a start - https://www.loc.gov/rr/amed/pdf/palestine4/Jewish-Atrocities-in-the-Holy-Land.pdf(You can start at page 4)
Good one. I see you can‚Äôt cite anything. Being a keyboard warrior isn‚Äôt active service lil man. I think the mtn. Dew has reaked havoc on your testosterone. But if trying to be a big man on here makes you feel valuable I feel for you. And yes my mom did birth a jackass. A jackass that‚Äôs done more for my country than you could even qualify for. I‚Äôm happy to provide and address if you‚Äôd like ti try your luck with this jackass.
Is Hezbolla enters the US is going to fuck them up...
I have friends who were EOD in Afghanistan. Thank you for your service. Also heard some real fucked up shit about kids being used by their parents as suicide bombers it really messed up my friends mental health but one of the nicest guys I know.
Listen ignorant, I ain't your teacher or mommy. It's sad your mommy had a jackass for a child. No name calling - just a description!Get yourself educated, come out of ignorance and support the oppressed - whoever they may be!
They get blown to shit wait and see scum bag
But on a serious and honest note... Why the hate?
All these stupid liberals supporting Hamas.  You‚Äôre gay?  Go try to be gay in Palestine.  You enjoy women‚Äôs rights?  Go try to have equality in Gaza.  You know where you can live how you want?  Israel.  People who support Palestine just hate Jews and would‚Äôve sided with Hitler.  Sick fucks
LoL ü§£ just wait till Hzbolla enters the scene... This was just hamas
Fuck you fuck Gaza burn it down
It‚Äôs true tho. We may well get overextended to be able to keep drawing down stockpiles, but we are not deployed in combat. I do worry China may take the opportunity to move on Taiwan, but then taking Taiwan alone does not change the world order. Neither does Russia taking Ukraine (or part of it). Israel getting destroyed/significantly degraded would impact the world order but not displace US/NATO/allies - I think the economic strength of the US/EU/Japan etc is the reason for this. A full on global conflict could upset the order which is why I don‚Äôt think the US/EU etc will go all in to protect Taiwan. Protecting Israel and therefore the order in the Middle East is likely more important. Just my thinking. I could be wrong (obviously).
Scum bags are going to get what's coming to them
Imagine being stupid enough to think none of this would've happened if lord savior Trump were still president. And since Trump is not president, somehow Biden is responsible.
Site your sources where over 6 million Palestinians were killed in 3 years‚Ä¶.. as a man and also an active EOD soldier I‚Äôve worked with the IDF. There are things I don‚Äôt agree with as far as innocent Palestinians but when I see the ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù civilians spitting on a naked corpse or a young Israeli woman they lose the ‚Äúinnocent‚ÄùCard. And why are they allowing hamas to build military targets right under them. Sooo how about stay in your lane. See how I did that? Without being a child calling someone a dumb fuck who could beat your ass while half asleep
You dumb fuck üòÇ "millions" of Palestinians did get killed! And if you're referring to the so called "holocaust" crap... If the Jews got killed and such why did they do the same on others who had nothing to do with it?
Oh did millions of Palestinians get killed in concentration camps? Nah didn‚Äôt think so. Terror is terror and if you cheer on terrorist. You are indeed also a terrorist
You support a 70 yr genocide?
Some people are just crazy
Nobody supports killing kids but using it to justify removing an entire population is not right
You support killing kids?
Golan heights are controlled by Israel you idiot !Nothing you say makes any sense.Go take it in the ass nob !
Putin probably instigated Iran to green light the hamas attack
Half of hamas leadership is probably fleeing the country. Among refugees. They don‚Äôt wanna be seen as aiding them when opposing powers pick up a phone call from said leaders. They could also being avoiding the situations European refugee takers have found themselves in with riots and crime
Fuck you dickhead!Just a handful of white people get killed and there's an uproar!For 70 years Palestinians died and no one felt nothing!
I‚Äôm pretty sure they know this , but did you know fire is hot?
100%
No Iran got what they wanted in orchestrating this whole thing. Saudi Arabia distancing itself from normalized relations with Israel. Putin got what he wanted, a distraction from his war and slowing of aid to Ukraine.
Oh, the video I saw shows the whole thing. Sorry, I was confused.
Before the explosion to after the explosion
Was there another video where the vehicle was cut? Sorry, I get triggered, man... I've been seeing a lot of crazy arguments... üò¨
Did you even read what I said you dumb ass, ‚Äúboth reported attacks on gazans are hamas attacks‚Äù get some fucking rest and stay off reddit for a couple days your fried
Dude, are you really trying to say Hamas isn't killing Palestinians? They fucked Palestinians, Palestinians should be outraged by their leadership of Hamas. They should kill Hamas as they leave to Egypt. Hamas and the new world that Putin wants is a fucking joke. When enough is enough, the only global reset that's going to happen is going to be a giant nuclear blast where no one wins. At this point it looks more appealing then the fucked up shit HAMAS did in isreal.
Both reported attacks on fleeing Gazans are hamas attacks, you would think people have the cognitive ability to realise why the video with the truck has been cut before till after the explosion for a reason, same thing with these as the journalists video
Everyone has their own level of morality.  He‚Äôs showing the world how low his is.
Kwok the kwak ü§£
The country of Iran has already involved itself. By supplying weapons to Hamas. Syria, jordan, Iran usa, britain, egypt, Lebanon and Russia along with turkey are all involved in this war. They are all taking the side of Hamas other than Britain and the USA. The war has more than escalated Hamas and Hezbollah are hiding in countries like Lebanon and the border of Egypt. Egypt is helping them regain strength and Hamas has hundreds of miles of tunnels under the border of Egypt and Gaza Strip. This is a mess that's going to affect everyone. Hamas created this problem by hiding bombs in Gaza and innocent homes of innocent families. This is why civilian life is being damaged because they allowed terrorist activity to operate out of their country. Just 5 weeks ago Israel mapped out a plan with Benjamin Netanyahu to live in peace with Gaza since Israel completely left the area and now Hamas destroyed that chance for Palestine
Sorry guys, but I think you should leave the church in the village. China has no interest at all to wage war, they are rather allies and remain in the background, supply weapons etc. just profit-oriented without taking damage, they wait until the others slaughter each other, but that still takes time... and Russia is completely overwhelmed with the Ukraine war... only exciting is what Iran does, especially because they can turn off the gas tap for all times easy... a question I ask myself, what about the Saudis, where are they? On which side?
You are the parasites the gross bugs of the world who need to be squashed and will be
Correct.
Only real winner is China. An they are the big player in everything that's happened since Ovid. It was the beginning of there attack on the west.
I went into this earlier. But technically no. They are using Ukraine as a proxy. Russia and China would use Iran as a proxy. So both Russia and US would be fighting separate wars with different adversaries. While simultaneously waging proxy war against one another. This would meet the criteria for WW3. However weather or not it's nuclear would depend on if Russia and Us is both going to win there own ground wars. Let's just say it would be very messy with the possible outcomes of this increasingly likely scenario.
There is a clip showing Hamas breaking through a section of fence or small barrier. A Russian can be heard telling them to move forward or move in. Putin is using Wagner to get rich and destabilise already why wouldn't do it there too. A war there, potentially with Iran involved, would be great for Russia's efforts to take Ukraine
Now you‚Äôre getting it‚Ä¶ btw it‚Äôs the same solution proposed by Hamas except Israel actually has the firepower and infrastructure to get it done. They weren‚Äôt kidding when they said war is hell. The only solutions for peace were rejected time and time again and now any mercies shown are out of the goodness of Israel‚Äôs heart. For perspective this is the equivalent of Pearl Harbor imo ‚Ä¶you know where we dropped nuclear bombs on innocent folks. There are NO good solutions here that don‚Äôt include Israel just letting it slide.
When the attack first took place info was coming out saying there had been isis style behaviour. A lot of this seems to have been fake with various clips that were nothing to do with the things that happened that day. I now wonder who shared those clips and the rumours and what did they stand to gain. I mean the Kremlin or the CCP could have because they would really stand to benefit if the US was busy somewhere else. I don't believe everything either side says. Both have gains to be made by lying. Edit: regarding Ukraine; They news sources I watch always celebrate the losses russia takes and talks about battles won but there is never mention of the cost because it would look bad. People all over need to have a positive outlook on the ukraine conflict and showing casualties wouldn't be good for that.
Hamas killed 40 children (supposedly) üò≠üò≠, Israel has killed 580 so far üò≠üò≠üò≠
Oh and I noticed the chopping baby‚Äôs thing was fake the second Biden said it I was sure of it Saying Hamas was chopping babies was clearly a ü™¥ plant , bec that put everyone in barbaric mode and ok with war
Praying for Israel &amp; Gaza ‚ô•Ô∏èI see a lot of trickery in the media so I ask my self why are they trying to trick us ?-They‚Äôre calling a Palestine üáµüá∏ flag a hamas flag -saying Israel is defending g there self (by playing offence ) staying in Israel would be defense - and again having no compassion for civilians because Hamas uses them as shields üõ°Ô∏è makes it completely ok to the news üì∞ to drop bombs on them since terrorists are using there innocent lives as shields üßêüßêüßê
Russia can't defeat Ukraine. What will they do with an elite fighting force like Israel?
Live stream on YouTube
No...they have too much to lose. The people in charge of Iran are having hard enough time staying in power.  Getting involved in Israel would be the end of Iran.  And they don't have the logistics to get involved.  How would they move troops that great of distance before Israel saw them coming and blew them out of existence. So no Iran will not get involved.
Fuck you
You can keep telling yourself that.
We do blame the British! They promised the land to both groups. When they couldn't sort out the errrors of their ways, they ran and passed it to the UN to sort.
Medical or science people of Reddit - how is this possible? Is the heart ‚Äúalive?‚Äù
Yeah? Doesn't change the fact that Russia wants them annexed again, fucking idiot. Literally what they're doing.  I swear people like you don't think for a second.
All that space and you hit something else in the air lol. Wild.
God, let's hope this is not true. however I too have my misgivings.
It‚Äôs always in the last place you look
Perhaps you can tell me because i am an old ignorant gal‚Ä¶ in my 60‚Äôs i have been reading and i well understand that HAMAS IS A TERRORIST REGIME.. one of many that roam the under belly of this earth‚Ä¶. Can you simply explain to me how Israel came to be and why they all fight over one piece of land holy to jews, christians and muslims.  Can you also explain how much money the USA puts in annually to to the Israel iron dome and why.. i have thoughts.. but i truly am interested in yours.
Ukraine was an independent country before it was annexed by the ussr, they had no choice.  Fucktard.
No idea, but watching them level a bunch of residential buildings with bombs that looked bigger than whatever Russia is using didnt look like the answer. Did you see the images after they had finished? An entire area was dust and rubble. And the reason I mentioned the holocaust and what hitler had done to the Jews was because of their impossible 24 hour evacuation notice. And when they try to evacuate? They killed them. Multiple videos of hospitals filled with wounded civilians. Paramedics stepping out of their vehicles clearly shaken and traumatized.  I wasn't comparing or condoning other genocides, just that we were taught what led up to it. Isreal is doing the same exact thing. They order them to evacuate in 24 hours and then killed them as they tried to leave. I'm convinced with the news that they knew a few days before the attack that they used this as a reason to attack Palestine as a whole. They want the rest of the land and this is the moment they chose to do it. Isreal is just as bad they just have a cause to execute their plans.  I mean they bombed Lebanon and Syria probably because they defended Palestine. Its pretty obvious what their intentions are in my mind.
Terrible take. Despite what the killing and other evil commited by/on both sides, lives of the innocent should not be discarded. a majority of poeple on both sides of the conlfict just want to live a peacful safe life with abundant food water shelter and medical resources and at least some hope for a better fututre. There are so many other possible solutions and avenues rather then killing and death and if you are not able to see this conflict as something that cannot be solved with peace you are part of the problem.
No GED yet?
IMHO he‚Äôs a kwak üòÇ
It‚Äôs getting deep in here, glad I brought my hip boots üòÇ
There was a video going around of her being given food and a water bottle. But no idea if it‚Äôs an old or new video
I think this idea with two states is good. And I'm hopeful that one day it will happen. Even though it might be a long road.
Yea but not with the US Libs weirdly enough because of the victim mentality even if they don‚Äôt open admit it most the far-left supports Palestine and is scared of their own parties ‚Äúcancel‚Äù mobs that they don‚Äôt want to confront the truth of hamas‚Äô barbarism
All of the comments about the US defense budget getting spread thin. The US defense budget hasn't even got started on spending yet. Isreal gets what they get from the US on the regular and Ukraine has been getting old equipment. They god that this put the US on 24/7 production mode for artillery shells. Really looking like we are going to need those.
US is on zero fronts
Sure listen to another demon‚Äôs thoughts
Fuck Miles Kwok, a known scammer and under investigation for massive fraud. You must be an idiot to spread this misinfo
If then sent American troops we the people is the USA well take down the Democrats who are in power we want no war it‚Äôs not are war
I keep thinking Russia was involved. It could be that Putin wants to create instability for any democratic nation states in the Middle East so he can take control of the oil rich lands once they are desperate for resources, food and support they will bend to a socialist autocratic rule.
I always thought of them having a country with 2 states one of Palestinians and one with Isrealians and they can travel to each other like the US, but deep down we all know this will never happen
It's not just them refusing to trade with gaza, they are blockading gaza from what they need to live. It's starving 2 million people.  And a great many will die if it's kept up.Edited for clarity
This is a shit post downvote
That puts the US on at least two fronts so far. We are going to over extend our capabilities.
Yeah thats a good point and I would agree that nobody should intervene here, let them sort it out themselves. But I would ask you, how do you go after Hamas without civilian deaths? I think you cannot kill them without it. If Hamas followed the Geneva you could, but they use Palestinians like pawns in their jihad, they put their military bases under civilian infrastructure, use people like shields and have brought nothing but pain and suffering to the population. I hope that Gazans would rise up and destroy Hamas themselves and take a deal to have their own country if they so choose or join Israel which would be better since we don't need Irans in the world.
Of course Hamas lays traps lol
I wouldn‚Äôt doubt if Russia goaded Iran into provoking this conflict. It spreads the US so thin, our aid to Ukraine falters, strengthening Russias hold, the US wobbles back and forth between the two incursions. China sees its opportunity to invade Taiwan.  North Korea feels emboldened to invade South Korea. Some dip shit launches a tactical nuke.The end.
Wouldn't be surprised at all if this gets out of hand. That's the way it always goes.
I was never for turning the water off... that's not right IMO. I agree it should be turned back on.Israel has to be careful 1. It doesn't get "bogged down" in Gaza and is open to attack from the North from Lebanon. 2. Don't go scorched earth. As you said it will only piss the Arab nations off more. Let civilians get out... I'm not sure a deep occupation of Gaza is a good idea. You forgot about Niger in Africa... shit is about to pop off there with France backed forces vs Russian backed forces.
horrible
No f-ing way!
 Very unlikely. Iran will surely provide financial assistance to Lebanon, hezbollah, and Palestine. But official entry is very unlikely because they know nato wants them to fuck around and find out already.
I can only repeat this:https://www.reddit.com/r/IsrealPalestineWar\_23/comments/177otsb/the\_only\_solution/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=web2x&amp;context=3
No. America has failed to annex everywhere its tried to annex post ww2
Everybody in the US is aware of that. Im not talking about Russia though. I dont think the US should even be involved with Isreals crap. Never thought what theyve been doing for decades to palestine was okay and I  am definitely against what they're doing now. Its one thing to go after Hamas but another thing to start slaughtering citizens that aren't involved. On another note, putin can also fuck off too.
A rare moment of the US defense budget actually seeming beneficial.
Hammas sealed the fate of Gaza. What will stop this war is when Hammas is eradicated. Terrorists have no right to be on this planet. They are responsible for the crimes against humanity and they are responsible for the repercussions that is falling on the innocent people of Palestine. Fuck hamas and anyone who supports them.
Don‚Äôt forget both China and Russia are entrenched in the Middle East at the moment.  I think this alone is giving Iran the support they need to carry out on their threats.  A statement Putin made at the beginning of the invasion on Ukrainian that stuck with me. ‚ÄúThis is all part of the plan‚Äù.  We can‚Äôt be naive and not assume that China/Russia/N. Korea and Iran didn‚Äôt have this planned from the beginning.  New World Order.  How else could you topple the US?  Spread us thin.  Crazy time we‚Äôre living in.
Ding ding ding‚Ä¶. Thankyou to the 1947 deal struck whe Golda Meir and Great Britian whom i believe had a land right of some sort to a portion of what is now Israel‚Ä¶ they needed a place for the 100,000 wrongfully displaced jews from germany.  WELL ENTER THE WEST‚Ä¶ WE WANTED A PARTNER IN THE MIDDLE EAST‚Ä¶ so the jewish people were moved to What is now Israel pushing out what were now i believe the Palestinians, Islamic rooted  THE HOLY LAND IN CONTENTION IS ROOTED TO JEWISH, CHRISTIAN AND ISLAMIC FAITH‚Ä¶. A perfect EXAMPLE TO ME THAT GOD IS GOD PERIOD.  But what does this dumb old gal know.It was to be a TWO STATE SOLUTION‚Ä¶.yet the middle east will not recognize ISRAEL AS a rightful state as they took the land with support of the West. and then USA (we) put several BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR INTO THEIR MILITARY SUPPORT CULMINATING TO THE IRON DOME‚Ä¶ all while pushing the Palestinians, Islamics out.  Thus the west helped colonize an area for resources and strategic power , much like hmmm the native american indian i might add‚Ä¶ but thats unpopular to say‚Ä¶ but this is why the middle east does trust America‚Ä¶GRANTED HAMAS IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION ‚Ä¶  but Israel has for years been building Kibbutz Communities  aggressively around this holy land .. the communities began popping up in the early 1900‚Äôs as a way for Jewish families to live off the land together near their holy land‚Ä¶ well in the 80‚Äôs israel realized  more land is better‚Ä¶ so they began to PAY FAMILIES TO EASTABLISH NEW KIBBUUTZ COMMUNITIES THAT WERE WELL FENCED AND HAD AMMENITIES SO THESE PAID FAMILIES COULD SETTLE IN NICE COMMUNITIES‚Ä¶ near their holy land‚Ä¶. In the palestinian part of the 2 state solution‚Ä¶.Heres where it gets more fun‚Ä¶. ISRAEL HAS BEEN CONTROLLING ALL OF THE WATER AND POWER‚Ä¶ AND SUPPLY CORRIDORS FOR THE GAZA STRIP FOR YEARS‚Ä¶ so the Palestinians have been  reliant on what Israel chooses to give them, while the Kibbutz Communities Encroach on their land.  IS IT FAIR‚Ä¶ hmmm‚Ä¶  NOW IF I AM WRONG PLEASE TELL ME SO RESPECTFULLY‚Ä¶ in have been reading about this since it began because in too wanted to know both sides‚Ä¶ NOT JUST THE ONE SIDE USA MEDIA PRESENTS‚Ä¶So not yelling‚Ä¶ i too am trying to make sure i understand. In my 60‚Äôs now i have the the time to actually did in some.  LIKE YOU I TOO WANT TO BE UNBIASED AND LOOK AT THE FACTS. When i do i see how greed and power ruin the world.Heres another fun fact ISRAEL HAS BEEN DOING SECURITY ROUNDS CHECKING THE SAFETY OF THESE COMMUNITIES AT WILL‚Ä¶ sounds like russias excuse recently‚Ä¶ when Jerusalem was made the capital of Israel it did not help matters yet Jared Kushner did have a deal working with the saudis‚Ä¶ which would have given ISRAEL what they wanted and palestine several billion dollars to create more for Palestinian people were not willing to recognize Israel as a state.  So we tried with saudi arabia, we were coming close to them doing it and bam hamas would not have it‚Ä¶. Now that deal is probably dead. It used to be a couple of rockets on each side got fired and a cease fire was negotiated‚Ä¶. Its clear the people with the scraps are sick of negotiating.  AND THE TERRORIST VACCUUM SUCKS UP NEW FIGHTERS EVERYDAY LOOKING FOR THEIR FAIR SHARE‚Ä¶ awful but if i look at both sides I get it.we have more and more good Palestinian Americans living in America Everyday who are not terrorists‚Ä¶ yet we exclude any sympathy for them.. we deny their existence in this mess‚Ä¶ yet when the protest or voice like jamie lee curtis in support of them she got backlash‚Ä¶ ridiculous‚Ä¶.So if i am wrong in any of this please someone set my old ass straight.. i truly want to understand as best i can‚Ä¶ BUT, there are TWO SIDES‚Ä¶. These terrorists cells did not just form‚Ä¶they formed because of history‚Ä¶. And choices‚Ä¶ and we should understand the choices made and why.   thankyou for your awesome post  and the awesome answer i responded to with the same comment..
Blockades and not supplying goods or trading with your enemy is common practice in wars, it's what happens in every war, thats not considered genocide. They are going to occupy Gaza, clear out Hamas and after alot of blood on both sides, if Palestinians are able to overcome themselves and stop the terrorism, they will be better off than any other Arab nation, just like arabs living in current Israel, it's not genocide.
Ding ding ding‚Ä¶.

But what does this dumb old gal know.It was to be a TWO STATE SOLUTION‚Ä¶.yet the middle east will not recognize ISRAEL AS a rightful state as they took the land with support of the West. and then USA (we) put several BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR INTO THEIR MILITARY SUPPORT CULMINATING TO THE IRON DOME‚Ä¶ all while pushing the Palestinians, Islamics out.  Thus the west helped colonize an area for resources and strategic power , much like hmmm the native american indian i might add‚Ä¶ but thats unpopular to say‚Ä¶ but this is why the middle east does trust America‚Ä¶ GRANTED HAMAS IS A TERRORIST ORGANIZATION ‚Ä¶  but Israel has for years been building Kibbutz Communities  aggressively around this holy land .. the communities began popping up in the early 1900‚Äôs as a way for Jewish families to live off the land together near their holy land‚Ä¶ well in the 80‚Äôs israel realized  more land is better‚Ä¶ so they began to PAY FAMILIES TO EASTABLISH NEW KIBBUUTZ COMMUNITIES THAT WERE WELL FENCED AND HAD AMMENITIES SO THESE PAID FAMILIES COULD SETTLE IN NICE COMMUNITIES‚Ä¶ near their holy land‚Ä¶. In the palestinian part of the 2 state solution‚Ä¶. Heres where it gets more fun‚Ä¶. ISRAEL HAS BEEN CONTROLLING ALL OF THE WATER AND POWER‚Ä¶ AND SUPPLY CORRIDORS FOR THE GAZA STRIP FOR YEARS‚Ä¶ so the Palestinians have been  reliant on what Israel chooses to give them, while the Kibbutz Communities Encroach on their land.  IS IT FAIR‚Ä¶ hmmm‚Ä¶  NOW IF I AM WRONG PLEASE TELL ME SO RESPECTFULLY‚Ä¶ in have been reading about this since it began because in too wanted to know both sides‚Ä¶ NOT JUST THE ONE SIDE USA MEDIA PRESENTS‚Ä¶So not yelling‚Ä¶ i too am trying to make sure i understand. In my 60‚Äôs now i have the the time to actually did in some.  LIKE YOU I TOO WANT TO BE UNBIASED AND LOOK AT THE FACTS. When i do i see how greed and power ruin the world.   Heres another fun fact ISRAEL HAS BEEN DOING SECURITY ROUNDS CHECKING THE SAFETY OF THESE COMMUNITIES AT WILL‚Ä¶ sounds like russias excuse recently‚Ä¶ when Jerusalem was made the capital of Israel it did not help matters yet Jared Kushner did have a deal working with the saudis‚Ä¶ which would have given ISRAEL what they wanted and palestine several billion dollars to create more for Palestinian people were not willing to recognize Israel as a state.  So we tried with saudi arabia, we were coming close to them doing it and bam hamas would not have it‚Ä¶. Now that deal is probably dead.It used to be a couple of rockets on each side got fired and a cease fire was negotiated‚Ä¶. Its clear the people with the scraps are sick of negotiating.  AND THE TERRORIST VACCUUM SUCKS UP NEW FIGHTERS EVERYDAY LOOKING FOR THEIR FAIR SHARE‚Ä¶ awful but if i look at both sides I get it.  we have more and more good Palestinian Americans living in America Everyday who are not terrorists‚Ä¶ yet we exclude any sympathy for them.. we deny their existence in this mess‚Ä¶ yet when the protest or voice like jamie lee curtis in support of them she got backlash‚Ä¶ ridiculous‚Ä¶.So if i am wrong in any of this please someone set my old ass straight.. i truly want to understand as best i can‚Ä¶ BUT, there are TWO SIDES‚Ä¶. These terrorists cells did not just form‚Ä¶they formed because of history‚Ä¶. And choices‚Ä¶ and we should understand the choices made and why.   thankyou for your awesome post  and the awesome answer i responded to with the same comment..
So I guess the only way to get rid of hamas is to completely obliterate all peoples in gaza, either with bombs or denial of water/food/shelter. Maybe later I suppose the folks in the west bank will be gone too. Finally, finally peace for Israel. /s
IDGAF beheaded or not. MANY children were slaughtered like cattle. Many in front of their family's to boot. Mass fucking murder. Despicable, discusting actions by people who have no place on this planet. FUCK HAMMAS AND ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS THEM. THIS IS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING BUT HUMANITY AND MORALS. HAMMAS HAS NO CARE ABOUT ANYONE (INCLUDING THEIR OWN PALESTINIAN PEOPLE WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS. ) except their own twisted terrible agenda. Their fate is sealed.
Of course it‚Äôs real. They Turned into Babysitters,  stopped Raping, taking hostages and blowing shit up. They now want Peace love and Ice Cream instead of being a martyr, killing whole families in their cars and getting their 72 Virgins up there. Also they don‚Äôt want the Israelis turn to dust. It‚Äôs just my opinion but how degenerated do you need to be to think it‚Äôs real?
We are 100% in WW3 now. Israel has to be careful not to take the bait and get bogged down in Gaza.
Potentially
Iran can't unless they want the US to officially step in.  That won't be smart.
It seems pretty escalated.
Your catching on. Very prevalent in the "us against them narrative".
Texting? After they cut the power to the whole strip? They got battery powered cellphone towers down there?
Looks like they are cutting off food, water, fuel and electricity to over 2 million gazans while bombing and shelling them. All while trying to force an evacuation of 1 million people of Northern gaza into Southern gaza within 24 hours. Seems like it meets the definition.Edited for repeated sentence
You must know nothing about Eastern Europe, I'm from it so I'll enlighten you, the invasion is based on protecting Russians living in Ukraine mostly eastern part, because of a supposed genocide against them in supposed ethnic Russian lands, Ukraine is blamed for being Nazis and oppressors of poor Russians. Listen to what putin says and the propogandists it's exactly the same rhetorric used against Israel.
ü´°
Divine intervention is required
Done!
Nevermind that no country wants Palestinian refugees. They've done nothing but start shit in every country that's welcomed them in the past. That's why Egypt said fk no to refugees the other day.
the deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group with the aim of destroying that nation or group - the standard one is good I think
You can bet on it.  No, things are not looking good at all.  In the larger scheme of things IMO Russia started WW3 by attacking Ukraine.  This is just the beginning.  Too many incursions on too many fronts; more to come.  China/Taiwan.  N/S Korea‚Ä¶.
Ok. Thx!
Is the entire civilian population 96% military aged males, or just around that particular hospital?
They always do these type or videos.  I remember one I saw a few years ago of bodies from a supposed attack but some of the actors moved under the sheets ü§£
Hey buddy you can't keep doing pressure on a ball not imagine it would rapture some day keep treating Palestinians like animals since nakba would really encourage war fight, so who starts this who kill Palestinians every day as a suspection of terrorist start to discuss the problem based on what happen in 2023 is wrong you need to discuss it from the start, beside media and every western platform like Facebook insta WhatsApp just blocking every page of post that support gaze and blaming Israel on killing children is it seems to be fair been allowed to only support the killer story ?
Im on mobile and I honestly didn't even know that there was a second comlumn. I would suggest you put it in text form and put the Israeli message first and the Palestinian message beneath it.
Because when they gave them the land the people elected a representative thats sole purpose is to annihilate the Jews. Seems reasonable to me to set up check points, walls, and restrict movement of people through checkpoints if they have demonstrated that they are not interested in peace and constantly barrage your cities with rockets. Hate wasn‚Äôt born in a vacuum, you‚Äôre right about that. It was already in their hearts and holy books.
Isrealis are terrorists to Palestinians. Israeli armed forces and police restrict their freedom of movement, inhibit their right to education, took away their nationhood, randomly search and seize objects, children of all ages, adults without any rhyme or reason. Public executions are the norms, without empathy flowing in one direction save Israel. Chanting save Israel is pretty similar to chanting ‚Äúsave U.S.A. from Native Americans.‚Äù Colonialism is ugly in all of its forms. It seems Isreal learned nothing from Notzi Germany if they‚Äôre committing genocide.
Truly awful scenes. You have to feel for innocents in times of war.My point still stands. Hamas would happily kill western secularists that are defending them saying isreal is the main problem.We are all at war with jihadists.
That was the only way I was able to have two texts alongside each other.If you tell me how, I will do something about it.
here is some evidences ?just before : [https://twitter.com/ragipsoylu/status/1712959287188754440?s=46&amp;t=vCuX8Pny9cphsYEw9Cvniw](https://twitter.com/ragipsoylu/status/1712959287188754440?s=46&amp;t=vCuX8Pny9cphsYEw9Cvniw)just after : https://twitter.com/ragipsoylu/status/1712944592021045668
And if they leave they can't come back, so it's the Israel dream from the start Palestinian won't let that happen.
While some of the civilians were leaving IDF bombed some of them so stop pretending it's Hamas, Palestinian people don't want to leave their homeland for some garbage not forced by Hamas so stop pretending it's the best solution, the best solution is to stop war giving Palestine their land.
What?
That makes sense. What is your definition of genocide?
Or maybe it‚Äôs the other way around? Maybe what we call schizophrenia IS actually having other entities having some kind of influence on a persons brain?
Remember when they invaded Israel and just started slaughtering civilians at a edm festival and in their homes???
I can't say anything for certain, but Russia is Iran's top ally and Russia is China's top ally. They are all in bed together and destabilizing the world plays to their benefit. I've been trying to think why Hamas would all of the sudden launch an attack like this. It makes no sense. What do they get out of this? Besides Israel trying to just wipe them off the face of the planet. But then I take a look at the big picture. What the reaction has been around the world and it starts to make sense. This attack has caused so much more division in the world, everyone is arguing even more than they have been. It's causing so much more chaos.
Cough cough‚Ä¶. That poster is ‚Ä¶. Wait for it‚Ä¶.Bullshit.
Would flushing a fish count as abuse too? How about hunting deer? I would say maby they should have killed them first before dumping them but that sounds a little worse right?
That‚Äôs real
Your caption for the video isn‚Äôt telling on yourself for being Hamas. Lmao OP, nice agenda.
I was curious so I tried to verify if the rift is really that recent. I couldn‚Äôt find it. Do you have a reference for fact checking?  Friendly question.
I've also realised that talking to you people is pointless so I'll stop. No act of barbarisim, no argument or even reality will convince you, you'll make up conspiracies, manipulate the truth and jump from point to point. Because the reality is, when someone hates the jews, they'll find any reason for it, and will defend barbarian terrorists and their attrocities to do so.
Lmao what? Isreal is absolutely not like Ukraine. What are you on? No reading comprehension skills. Ill say it again, Hamas does not equal the entirety of Palestine. If you think thats the case you're an idiot. Ukraine was part of Russia during the soviet union. They want to remain independant while Russia wants their old blocs back. Isreal is sitting on what used to be entirely Palestine. You have it completely twiated. I'm not saying any genocide is better than the other.  Genocide is genocide its all bad. This is genocide and its bad
The jews didnt declare war on Germany and loose, its not the same thing at all and your example is stupid because it says genocide is good against other genocide, ir is also not relevant at all. Hamas btw is actuall calling for all jews to die in the world, and acting on it. This conflict is actually similar to Ukraine and Russia, Palestinians are like Russians and Israel like Ukraine. Same ethnic land ideology, same argument in oppressed people and so on, except we support Ukraine, because it is right, so is Israel.
Let this sink in‚Ä¶..If hamas put down their guns there would be peace, if Israel put down their guns there would be no Jews left in Israel.
Yes both sides have built up equal dossiers of thousands of years of oppression, most of which seems to not be against each other. In recent times both sides have not maintained any sort of clean sheet and each side seem to stoke the fire of the other.Is the tit for tat pendulum to keep swinging for the next few thousand years too. Each generation of both sides seem to repeat the mantras of their religions which although they have much common ground including prophets, the words in books and the one GOD also perpetuate their responses to adversity and death. If there is an earthquake or flood then it is gods will. If there is war then it is gods will. If there is oppression etc etc then it is gods will‚Ä¶Both sides term each other pagans or infidels and repeat that if they fight for the one god or become martyrs then they will go to heaven. But my point is have they really thought it through because one god one heaven also means both sides will also be in the same heaven. Now forgive me for over simplifying 1.5 to 2.5 k years of both religions but whatever god gives them to get on in the same heaven we could really do with on this earth.Unless of course there are two heavens which also does not sit well with the rest of the worlds population and religions.It‚Äôs time for the theological wings the armed wings and the overwhelming majority of normal people to agree something and set a goal for their grandchildren.
Wow you discovered a secret. Go ahead please.
Flying while texting If the two planes had been just higher or lower by a few feet, might have been ok.
You went to school, right? You learned about the holocaust and how it happened? You do realize Hitler did the same exact thing,  right? He ordered the Jews to leave and then put them in ghettos.  He ordered them to leave again and moved them to camps. Ordered them to leave again and killed them. If you can't put two and two together and see that this is premeditated and in fact a genocide of Palestine people then you're in denial. I don't support hamas but isreal can also go fuck itself as well.  Hamas does not equal the entirety of Palestine. Hamas is a militant group closely tied to ISIS that also happens to be Palestinian. Do they need to be stopped? Yeah.  Does all of Palestine need to be exterminated and pushed into the ocean? Dude, if i need to answer that question for you... I don't respect anybody that supports Israel's current actions.   You're a piece of trash if you do. I'm disgusted with the US for their full support in this conflict and I'm from the US. I'm not taking sides, this is absolutely disgusting and I'm ashamed of people and our country for showing their support for it.
Lots of Israeli money in the US.Many rich Jews in the US.Not a lot of rich Palestinians.
Thank you for clarifying that.
I guess England commited genocide agains Germany in ww2 as well
this is in no way a genocide, and when genocides actually begin, people will be numb to the word. I cant be trown around like that
I guess England commited genocide against germans too in ww2

Well seems to me you guys didn‚Äôt learn anything dime after what adolph did to you.
What's Putin going to do?  Lol
People keep falling for this propaganda. They are using them as human shields. Those babies serve as propaganda props as well. Wake up. Just smell the F ing coffee and save your mother land, neighborhood from this infection( you know what I am talking about )
Sea of information and people are drowning in ignorance.
Okay, so If Israel ‚Äúgave‚Äù gaza and the West Bank, not sure it was theirs to give, but for this sake, okay. Israel occupies Gaza and the West Bank, builds walls and military check points with the express goal of making life next to impossible for the average human to go about their daily lives. Why wouldn‚Äôt that state rise up against an occupation? Hate isn‚Äôt born in a vacuum, and if everyone plays an eye for an eye, soon the whole world is blind.
Do you know who ‚Äúprotects‚Äù their citizens from ‚Äúmisinformation?‚Äù  China and Russia

I got bell palsy from the covid vaccine and still have nerve damage on the left side of my face and ear. It definitely did hurt people. Most vaccines can have negative side effects and I'm not anti vaccines.
Shutting off water, internet, electricity. Immediate full response on the boarder of their entire military despite being warned off an attack days before. Killing citizens as they obey an order to evacuate.Yeah, okay. Definitely not a genocide. You're a fuckin nob. Idc about the downvotes but you need to know how much of an idiot you are. Fucking pathetic human trash.
I think we have bigger things to worry about here in the US. It's their problem let them figure it out.Instead of sending money and aid over there let's take care of our problems FIRST

i wish that whoever did this be sent into the pits of mordor
They are not. In the video he talks about them sending arms to Russia. Ita just a stupid ass title and thumbnail.
What's the dudes sorce on this. All I can find is N Korea sending weapons to Russia.Edit: it was just a click bait title and thumbnail. They are sending arms to Russia to fight in Ukraine,  not Ukrainians.
What do you mean?
First off, Mexico would not take my land! Also, if you think killing Innocent Israelis is Palestines path to freedom think again!
Why are they so damn slow?!?!
Don't get me wrong, Israel have definitely been documented committing heinous atrocities on camera such as shooting innocent people. Israel are no angels. But it would be disingenuous to say that Hamas have the Palestinian people's best interests at heart. They are no better than a death cult like ISIS. It's a tragic situation and I hope innocent Palestinians will get out of danger safely. The world needs to intervene to stop Israelis and Palestinians from killing eachother.
Because of Russia. Putin offered something to him when they met in Russia last month.
Why would they send weapons to Ukraine? (Serious question, I didn't know they ever communicated)
They both evil
100%
the people who were fleeing gaza were killed before having time to flee isreal didnt follow thier shooting schedule for some reason and shot people while they were fleeing
It the final outcome q
no tunnels dont need money cause they only use shovel and nets also making hunkers for many people in short time is fricken hard
I agree... they need to get over that 100%... you almost need a masters degree in middle eastern history to get to the bottom of this mess.
The nice part about Jews is that as parasites, they often kill their hosts. At this rate, they‚Äôll have sucked the blood out of America in less than a century.
I agree that war sucks but what should any sovereign nation do to a known enemy that has violated your borders, killed and kidnapped your women and children? Israel didn‚Äôt have to give them Gaza or the West Bank at all. It sought peace through the delegation of that land to the Palestinian people and have gone out of their way to make several peace offerings. Hell they even built the iron dome to protect its citizens instead of having to wipe these people out in retaliation for the endless barrage of rocketry. They have taken multiple measures to avoid continued loss of civilian life already, but I‚Äôm not sure how much more patience we can ask them to reasonably have.
Yeah they really fancy having a civilization of meat shields. Fucking animals
Strict scrutiny analysis completely debunked any of the theories you‚Äôre claiming to be censored. That‚Äôs just the truth. Sorry for so many comments didn‚Äôt see your first one
The first amendment says nothing about fooling other people with misinformation. Your interpretation of it is skewed
Likely their religion and belief that there can be no peace while a single Jew occupies Israel‚Ä¶if I had to guess. Hence their decline of every peace deal ever offered to them.
No, I think information should align with fact, the election factually wasn‚Äôt stolen, vaccines factually don‚Äôt kill people. It‚Äôs time to grow up and accept these facts and understand there are consequences to spreading lies. Even on the internet.
You think that people should only be able to speak and share information that align with your biased views.  You don‚Äôt have a clue what the first amendment is.
Okay, *even if you were even close to correct* in that statement, you clearly don‚Äôt understand the [First Amendment](https://firstamendment.mtsu.edu/article/strict-scrutiny/) and strict scrutiny analysis.
How so
This is what Hamas is doing now. Not allowing people to leave
I don't think we have seen the result of that or not yet... once Israel goes into Gaza and starts to engage Hamas then we will see what happens. Hezbollah is waiting to see how that goes first.
You‚Äôre the problem
Sort of... but ask yourself why they are so evil? What made them so?
Really?
The ground assault begins
You need to keep your barter tokens alive. Always remember that. Kids are what a country comes for first if they‚Äôre being held. If you have a bunch of dead babies the only thing you‚Äôre doing at that point is actively angering your opponent and lose your leverage. War is the worst thing I‚Äôve ever seen or will see and I still have a long life left.Edit: with that being said, yes I do think they‚Äôre keeping care of them but it works for Hamas 2-fold. Again protection and it‚Äôs great propaganda.
What is this terrible format? Please fix
-Aeschylus
Because Hamas operate and hide amongst the civilian population. The fire rockets from residential areas, so any retaliatory strike would end up hurting civilians. It's not hard to understand. Saying human shield doesn't mean they are literally holding them whilst engaged in a fire fight with the IDF. It just means that they operate amongst a civilian population on purpose so as to prevent retaliation. If Israel retaliates, they end up looking like the bad guys.A very recent example of this is that Israel have ordered the evacuation of 1.1 milion Palestinians from north Gaza. Hamad have been telling them not to go and do disobey this order. Why would they do this knowing full well what Israel is about to do?
So Russia and China are actually the ones behind this war?
Sounds like my five year old when he can't put his legos together
Thank you for that independent analysis and thorough critique.
Do you not see how this is playing out in the west? Have you not seen how divided everyone is on this subject. All the chaos it's causing.
Because the whole situation is fishy there‚Äôs propaganda and lie‚Äôs coming from our corrupt governments of the world they have cut power to Garza and are starving the people I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs a war crime I truly believe they are purposely setting up a war just for the sole reason of its good for business
One tribe of apes attacked a civilized country
Not what I mean at all. If being competent with weapons and physically fit equates to dying for rich people then you have misunderstood. What I mean is that IF there is a conscription I would want the best chance of survival and that means being fit at the least. I know some are all too ready to volunteer to assist Israel but if this does devolve into all out multi country war then I would not be too surprised to see the draft reinstated. Lastly, you should ask yourself if going to fight the modern day equivalent of nazis (in their currently displayed treatment of life) is the same as dying for the rich. Some people stand for something, some people won‚Äôt sit idly by while their countrymen are called yo some distant shore to abate evil.
Islam equips people to hate their neighbors because of nuances in interpretation. It‚Äôs why it merely spreads but never unites, (at least after the Arabian empire‚Äîwhich forced one interpretation, and the Ottoman Empire which didn‚Äôt care, just wanted taxes)
Puppy looks a little too clean to be a rescue in a ‚Äúbag‚Äù that dirty. Also that dog looks more AI generated than the charred body.
But HAMAS found the money to make the tunnels for them. Why are the Palestinian residents not allowed down in the tunnels for protection?? Especially the  women and children.  Iran gives HAMAS 100 million dollars a year. HAMAS also makes 12 million a month from import taxes. I'm just trying to gain knowledge on the subject.
You do realise this is a war in the middle east, not the west?

I work in the operating room and have removed hearts (or organ procurements) before. Honesty most intense shit in my whole life. From patient passing to putting the heart on that pump you have about 20-25 minutes. Surgeon and I removed one specific heart in about 8 minutes. Honestly the saddest thing is a lot of patient heart removals are from healthy people who pass due to suicide, drugs, etc.Edit: that machine will keep the heart pumping and alive for about 24 hours. In that time the heart will be shipped, flown, driven, etc to the recipient awaiting a new heart. Actually for the most part while the heart is being sent to the next location the heart team has the patient open and waiting for the hearts arrival
The thing which you and the Zionist don‚Äôt want to understand is that Palestine is the land for both Christian and Muslims and Jews alike, since the beginning of time. The indigenous people of the lad of Palestine whisk never have to evacuate their own land. Palestine is the birth of Christianity. The Israeli Zionist are the terrorist who have been brutally and barbarically killing innocent civilians for the last 80 years. It‚Äôs time they leave back to the scum of Europe from which they all came to expecting to continue stealing land from the Palestinians. Then they wonder why the both Christian, Muslim and even the true Jewish people,not the evil Zionist want justice and freedom for the Palestinian people. They will keep resisting and fighting for the right to exist. So now the Zionist have find a place to be, oh wait nobody want evil and vile Zionist in their country either, they will do what they did to the Palestinian people, just murder and steal land from innocent indigenous people until the people of the land had enough there too. The oppressor cannot continue to oppress without the oppressed resisting back. The entire world is watching.
People can‚Äôt handle the truth, that‚Äôs what‚Äôs sad. If Israel wasn‚Äôt a strong nation and protected they would cease to exist right now. I am happy they have the means to resist and defend themselves against a hateful religion. To be honest if Israel didn‚Äôt have the love of God inside them Hamas,Palestinians and the Muslim faith would have been extinguished long ago. Please Stop pointless religious wars‚Ä¶
Good advise telling people to waste their live to die for the rich.The info about the war was good tho.
The New Federal state of China does not have any political orientation, nor does it have any interests; what we oppose is Hamas and terrorism. On humanitarian grounds, we do not want to see innocent people killed by terrorists. We hope that our voices will be heard in Israel, Palestine, the United States, and the peace-loving people of the world.Hamas has a political force behind it, giving support in terms of weapons, strategy and tactics, materials, etc. Hamas's next strategy and tactics are:The first step is to lure the Israeli army from the ground to Gaza, where Hamas has arranged a large number of unprecedented lethal weapons, especially the remote control super bombs buried in the ground in advance, which will bring large-scale damage to the Israeli army;Second, if the Israeli army enters Gaza, there will be a large number of new weapons from the Golan Heights that have never been fired at Israel, mainly against all energy facilities and other important facilities;The third step, from the direction of Egypt, with already deployed unlimited weapons, death squads, etc., directly kill the land of Israel, the key place will use suicide bombs;Step four: Israel is so weakened that the United States and Britain may intervene in the war. Whether or not Britain and the United States entered the war, the war was just beginning. Hamas will then use new forms of warfare and new weapons.We emphasize once again that the New Federation State of China has no political orientation, nor does it have any interests; what we oppose is Hamas and terrorism. On humanitarian grounds, we do not want to see innocent people killed by terrorists. We hope that our voices will be heard in Israel, Palestine, the United States, and the peace-loving people of the world.United States eastern time: 21: 2513th Oct 2023 Mr. Miles Guo

And u ignorant fact are ignoring that Hamas fighters just went on a killing spree murdering civilians including kids - so yes, they do that
Why take prisoner?
It‚Äôs properly real, but for propaganda purposes. It would be nice to think that at least some of them are not completely evil though‚Ä¶
Why in the f*** did they kidnapped kids? How is this video showing they are the hood guys? Kids are innocent and they are using them as pawns. Pro Palestine people need to get the head out of the sand and see what their countryman are doing to these kids.
You‚Äôre not understanding the point.  Once people realized that social media platforms banned content that was contrary to their beliefs, people lost trust in the truthfulness of the content they were seeing
Hey liberals who love hamas... they kill anyone who is believed to be gay in Palestinian controlled lands. You supporting hamas is not even hypocrisy because it's so far beyond that. You call people who disagree with gender reassignment surgery on minors "bigot" and "nazi' while now defending a terrorist nation that murders anyone who is believed to be gay!
why should this be Egypts responsibility?  if anything get a bunch of ships and dump them on Iran
the problem is Hamas is allied with the Islamic brotherhood who are an egyptian terrorist group and egypt does not want hamas helping or encouraging the IB in any way. so they're worried if they open the door to Palestinian refugees they open the door to Hamas as well... and they dont want that to happen
lebanon made that mistake and let Palestinian refugees into the southern part of the country. only to have them arm themselves and start attacking israel from lebanon causing israel to retaliate against lebanese territory  (very very abbreviated version)see Lebanese war 1982 (very messy, confusing conflict, so many sides. to hard to do a simple explanation)
Yeah I'm sure they are raping the kids as we speak
Nothing warrants either sides actions.
Can we remove the fats?
The leftists also must have been lying all this time about supporting the LGBT community as well. Hamas has zero tolerance for pride and will murder anyone thought to be gay.
Are there really photos of 40 beheaded babies? That's just too crazy to believe
Oof. Well considering that we now know the left has been lying about supporting the LGBT community they will proudly wear these. They hate Israel, the place gay people flee to from hamas. In Gaza they murder anyone who is thought to be gay.
They use children and teens as suicide bombers ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è you really don't think they're not capable of harming children? Have you not ACTUALLY studied these people? We're talking about the same group of people that advocate for the forced marriage of children. My best friends ex wife if currently married to one of these nuts, she is one of eight wives some of whom are 10 and 12 years old. Stop putting your western sense of morality onto everyone thinking all people of the world think and act like you do. "they will be martyrs, if the children must die then they will die, this is how we show your cruelty"
Where are they supposed to put them. They will almost certainly flood the streets and then Egypt will have a homeless crisis which will turn into a humanitarian crisis, which will then be their problem.
nasty ass religion. why is your disgusting excuse for a god the only one left that justifies the slaughtering of innocent civilians. that‚Äôs why when i see videos of your people in pieces for the next 10 years i won‚Äôt feel a bit of sympathy. weak man.
That's sadly the logic of these trash Muslims who keep sending me this garbage.
Disgusting
Well there technically the body vests. Nothing stops a bullet quicker then children. Absolute scum. May special forces aim be swift and true.
Well if you see two people fighting‚Ä¶ and can make a lot of money off it more power to you!‚Ä¶ but at the same time many people are dying‚Ä¶ both sides so it‚Äôs ultimately you that decides where you stand no one else‚Ä¶. Just do what‚Äôs right in this life!‚Ä¶ help people and make things better for everyone!.. do that and nothing else matters!!
‚Ä¶.excuse me
Na . They overplayed their hand . They thought the rest of the Muslim countries would come to their aid  and were gravely mistaken
It seems more knee jerk retaliation rather than a defensive move IMO a fool‚Äôs mission if the goal is to recover the hostages. I can‚Äôt see how all of the civilians and hostages are going to be able to move from the north to the south in time to avoid being more collateral damage, warnings or not. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, Hamas are clearly the provocateurs here and making Israel look bad is their intended goal. I was horrified by the reports of the attacks over the weekend. I just wish cooler heads would have prevailed. War sucks, and sadly there‚Äôs never any winners, only loosers.
This looks like the kibbutz near the festival they slaughtered. They are long gone from this village and nobody including children were left alive. These arent sympathetic human's they are animals. Just look at the footage of the women they took over the boarder, blood soaked rear ends most likely due to gang rape and that poor german girls twisted body in the back of the ute.
Thinking of the mama cat‚Ä¶ üòî
BAJAJAJAJAJA FUCKING CLOWN!ü§°ü§°ü§°ü§°
I do have proof that they through a fucken grenade in a bomb shelter full of innocent civilians that's all the proof I need.
Cowards using babies as human shields
They had it coming
It sucks that hammas was the only one you could side with, but they side with Iran so fuck Hamas.
Lame comment
Is there tunnels everywhere cause buildings just fall so easily
Not necessarily intended but likely. Israel is doing a lot including knock bombs, texting and calling people telling them to leave buildings that they are going to target. It‚Äôs long enough to save lives but not long enough to move or recover military hardware. Hamas has called for the people to ignore the warnings from Israel. The Hamas leadership wants their people to suffer and die so they can show how awful Israel is. It is and has been their play for a long time. They hide behind civilians and base within schools and hospitals in an attempt to provoke Israel into leveling those facilities. Even as Hamas launches rockets from hospital roofs it‚Äôs ALWAYS bad optics to bomb a hospital.
I did the 8 hour class with the 2 jump masters.  I heard a guy screaming when we jumped out of the plane and realized a few seconds later that guy was me.  I held on to my pull no problem though!  They said we‚Äôd have to pay for it if we lost it.
Those kids are worth alot of money that's why
I'd be right there with you bro.
This is war, and this is what war looks like. The only tear I will shed is for the face that was physically slapped first.
Right right right‚Ä¶What bullshit. ‚ÄúLet me steal your children to take care of them before we cut their heads off‚Äù. It‚Äôs time to end anymore talks about a free Palestine. Let‚Äôs join Israel and wipe Palestine off this planet forever. Then remember what supporting terror will get you. FURY!!!!
You have No proof of that, and they based on facts palestinien resistance have no past of killing or beheading children. If you look at real facts it‚Äôs Israel who kills innocent children and starves a whole city from food and cuts out water. You make me sick you ignorant fuck
Reminds me of the video of the Hamas terrorists, shooting the dog at the kibbutz running up to greet them
No he is correct. Your uninformed.
I do not condone violence... how ever, there are a few exceptions in life, this beings one of them
This is fake.
Albert Einstein actually had condemned isreal for stealing the land and war crimes.
Crazy how people downvote you for talking truth
3/4 of them dont. they are only in power because of a fucked up system they have of voting people in.
Wrong
This almost accidentally happened to my family.A neighbour a couple doors down had a pregnant car, and one day it came back and it wasnt pregnant but they had no idea where the kittens were.He came to look in our garden a few times and searched our shed too to no avail.One day the binmen came, and we had a large narrow box in the back garden to go into the waste so my mum asked them to come and grab it.As they were swinging it to throw in the truck, a kitten fell out. They looked inside and all the kittens were there.
God damn he looks better at 80 than he did 50
Wouldnt social media mods be automatically pro israeli under fear of being called an antisemite?
I dont think the israeli‚Äôs can see beyond their own noses either for obvious reasons. Ok jokes aside, i have seen some short clips showing the aftermath of the invasion by hamas but where can i find longer clips of the initial incursion by hamas?  Funker530 usually has no filter on their content but maybe they shortened some clips because of their brutality which they do sometimes if its for propaganda.
No you wouldn‚Äôt. Also, if Mexico took over your land, and was shooting your kids for throwing rocks, or blowing up your houses and schools, when they gave you a few miles of land, and took everything else, you‚Äôd be fighting back. Fuck Israel
what it taste like
He used to not be a complete sell out, but he always was a liar, (ie 1988 presidential run)
Hostages are only useful if alive so they will keep them alive as long as they need to
With fragile egos, It‚Äôs easier to live in denial than admit they are in the wrong.
3 out of the 5 kittens survived
you said it well.  up is an idiot
Yes, jeez my phone autocorrects words that are spelled right but similarly to other words sometimes. It's so annoying. Thank you for pointing that out.
Please tell me they survived or I will violate the Geneva convention in ways not yet thought possible
You just can't beat this video.
Deer?
Orange man is a p.o.s.
Putin probably gave the orders to Iran for Hamas to do this massacre. Every time he talks he usually speaks on a subject he's actually guilty of but wants us to think otherwise. Literally every time he opens his mouth he does this
I wish we knew the people that pulled shit like this so ruin the people's lives that do this.
I've eaten a deer heart before and it was fuckin delicious, dude. The first bite was the hardest.  Edit: Spelling Error.
Why do I feel like the Heart looks scared?
Please, just one bite
Honest question.  Why doesn't HAMAS dig safety bunkers  for the people of GAZA? Why doesn't HAMAS allow the residents into the tunnels? Instead of leaving them to face the bombing themselves.I'm not looking to cause a fight. Just wondering.
Russia and China have spent billions of dollars dividing western nations and it looks like the investment is really paying off
Well it must have been easy for you - easy to get the little dog-cats adopted out. I want one too. Just kidding you did good.
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRFRSQbZOlo&amp;t=3s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRFRSQbZOlo&amp;t=3s) indeed
About half the population is under 18
They are not trying. They are succeeding and the west is cheering it on.
So.The baby mutilation has been confirmed through multiple sources. Many of those sources have no government affiliation. I will also add that it is a huge violation for the Jewish people to display their dead. It violates many principles for handling of the dead. The Jewish people don‚Äôt even have open casket funerals, as they are considered disrespectful to the dead. In order to combat all the hateful and vile deniers that are oh so very vocal, they had no choice to release the images so the world would truly SEE the atrocities carried out by Hamas. There is a huge amount of misinformation out there. Israel only supplied a portion of the water and power to Palestine. They have cut off what they were supplying to pressure Hamas to release the hostages. Most of which are elderly, women, and children. Palestine has received a HUGE amount of aid from the global community in the form of food and materials to build infrastructure. Hamas has intercepted that aid and used it to fund terror activities. There is a video circulating (from Hamas itself) that displays them using pipes meant for water and refitting the pipes to make them rockets. Further, the IDF has gone, and continues to go, so far out of the way (often to the detriment of the soldiers) to warn civilians and mitigate the cost to civilian life. Hamas on the other hand, orders Palestinians to stay in place. They go further by embedding their headquarters in places such as hospitals, schools, and places of worship.The goal of Hamas is total eradication of the Jewish people (per their own charter). They don‚Äôt give a damn how many indie in the process or attempts to reach said goal. Israel has not had a presence in Gaza since before 2010. To be clear, this is not a fight against occupation. It is a fight to commit genocide against the Jews. Israel must respond swiftly and decisively, to root out Hamas in order for there to be any chance for stability and survival.
Yeah I agree, it's just wrong... same with what Hamas did. It's all just wrong. God has left that place.
No where can I find any confined cases of that happening. The Israeli government even withdrew their confirmation of it happening and some of the photos circulating got outed at fake per CNN/NBC
So this is the modern day ‚Äúkill them all, let God sort it out‚Äù?
It was not torture at all the baby got dropped into the crack of the train tracks in India, gotta love bestgore.com for posting weird shit  interesting how it goes but still meh don‚Äôt care about gore like that anyway.
Egypt has more than 9 million refugees from alot of countriesYou just want to arab countries to take Palestinians out of their lands so isrealis could steal it in peace
I mean you would have to be a monster to not at least sympathize with the true innocents on the Palestinian side of things. They are about to suffer the wrath of a very efficient very ruthless military that has the slogan of ‚ÄúDecisive Victory‚Äù. There is going to be a tremendous amount of life lost here.  All of which plays into EXACTLY what Hamas wants. They shield themselves behind civilians and set up shop within schools and hospitals in order to goad a huge reaction from Israel which then I turn acts as a rally cry to neighboring Muslim countries and Hamas sympathizers. Well, unfortunately the time for talk is over and they are about to get the reaction they wanted. So unfortunate for all involved.
Every time someone is against this stuff they say "That money could help ppl here" and guess what? That never happens. It's a dumb excuse. That money is already allocated to the Pentagon.This is like the conservative calling card. But when it comes time to help people in the US its all "gOvEnMenT OvErReEcH"
https://youtu.be/ODfCVxVLqiE?si=7-Du0dBWqlFVXElM
Umm yeah that‚Äôs what happens when you invade a country and specifically target innocent civilians. They were literally executing children, beheading little babies. Killing the elderly. Israel literally said there will be no mercy. Warned the civilians in gaza that they were coming for destruction after what hamas did over this past weekend. Hamas literally hides behind civilians.
Scum bag
You sound dumb af
Well if they'd just signed the fucking autograph.
Well if they'd just signed the fucking autograph.
Lol. Thats because its not. A bunch of pussies in pajamas killed kids at a music fest and are now getting annihilated by a top tier military. Hamas bears the total responsibility for civilian deaths in Gaza.
Level it
No videos? Did you just wake up and notice Hamas and Israel are not BFFs? It‚Äôs literally covered everywhere as part of how Hamas are asymmetric in their method of war.
This is entry level propaganda if you think for a second either side are baby sitting taking care of children you‚Äôre insane. Jews or pals.
Lolwutm8
Isreal has been in the lead and lapping the Palestinians on that front for decades.
As far as I know there is no confirmation on the baby mutilation. Most of the rest of the stuff seems to be legit though.
Hummus are the type of people to slap kids around and then bandage them up so they can beat them again later.
Those refugees sometimes turnout to be extremists and they don‚Äôt want them to spread like cancer into their own countries
I didn‚Äôt excuse anyone for anything.  Apparently you are totally unaware of the bullshit that the fat ass orange one was trying to do to Ukraine which is not a reach at all.  And it looks like you don‚Äôt know US history very well.i just checked and found that series about Lincoln is on HBO not PBS.  If you don‚Äôt have HBO check with your local library to see if they have dvds.  If they don‚Äôt they‚Äôll probably get it for you.  It‚Äôs well worth your time.  I‚Äôm more impressed with the man than I was before.
I can‚Äôt imagine how this person can even function or sleep at night. Actual garbage piece of shit needs to get thrown in that truck instead of those poor babies
Lies
Get back in your box Mr war criminal. You lost the world‚Äôs respect to make such comments years ago.
Hamas is using their own civilians as human shields because there is no way for them to fight like soldiers and win. They tunnel like rats underground.
I also watched it live, and just rewatched it to make sure. She didn't say all 40 were beheaded. She said soldiers told her what they saw, and the saw dead kids, babies decapitated, and whole families gunned down in their home. No mention of how many when commenting on the decapitated babies. Most people just don't listen well.
That was more dark than expected
Because even though it's unpopular to talk about or acknowledge, those particular people have exhibited a pattern of behavior over the past few decades that most logical people would consider undesirable to absorb into their populace. Women and children, perhaps, but military aged males need not apply.
Can you imagine just being tossed in a bag with your siblings to ride around in trash until you run out of air?
Cool. I worked in an animal shelter for three years, and it definitely affected my views about the rescue industry, but I never thought this shit was okay.
What in the name of Christmas is WRONG WITH PEOPLE. I don‚Äôt like cats yet it would absolutely never cross my mind to tie some baby cats up in a plastic bag and throw them in the gd trash
When they learned that beheading them was not working in their favor
I think the answer to this question is pretty simple, because Hamas has always operated this way.  Why would it be different this time?  In Chile we have a very large Palestine population and I have worked in Gaza and Lebanon three times in relief work with Chilean groups.  One thing is evident to everyone in Gaza, there are many who don't support Hamas and Hamas is responsable for so much suffering of Palestinos.
Thank youThis is best ever presentation I have ever seen and clearly shows how Isreal clearly never followed UN rules to the land.
https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZT8hewWwA/
But it‚Äôs fine to kill our friends at a music festival!? All young women and men. These terrorist scum are raping these women and children. They will all pay for their disgusting acts of terror.
Why would I care of someone who thinks about me who used ‚ÄúMuslim goat fucker‚Äù as a insult? You big belled sister breeder you can literally search up her name of her news casting agency. But spend another 15 min searching random shit up. You sausage, you say random shit is propaganda BUT ABOUT WHAT?
It's actually correct until you deleted the comment like the scum you are. There's no way you live in the Gaza Strip and use foul english language. You're a young punk and a disgusting human for trying to pretend to be in turmoil.
Ah yes lets hate on the republicans the one's who freed the slaves and say that it's not the same party anymore. Or let's excuse Biden for being a weak public official because it's not his fault. Better if we really screech we can reach really high and somehow make the Ukraine conflict a result of trump. lmao
You lie no video exists of her saying 40 babies were beheaded.  Show the link or you are a liar. These are the reports she made that day.  Not one says 40 babies.  But since you are a liar and ignorant you will still spread propaganda that some where a video exists.  Post a link to the video or we all know you are a liar.https://twitter.com/i24NEWS_EN/status/1711734085758960038https://twitter.com/i24NEWS_EN/status/1711697093151056355https://twitter.com/i24NEWS_EN/status/1711693459235451033
Sounds like freedom is coming, and hamas is going
Would that be from the fruit punch Kool-Aid?We may have had the impression of more peace in the world but that was because he was playing into Putin and Xi‚Äôs hand.  The ass hat was trying to kill off NATO.  But when he got bounced and there  was a chance that Ukraine would become a part of it Putin decided to go back to the genocide plan for Ukraine. And apparently you missed the part where fat ass was using law enforcement against US citizens in the US.  That was definitely not peaceful.Obama inherited a total shit show from Bush but left the economy chugging along nicely for dick breath chump to inherit.  Obama could‚Äôve left it in even better shape but the racist controlled Congress weren‚Äôt going to be shown up by a black man.  Things are more expensive now than they were prior to the pandemic because of a few different factors.   None of which could be controlled by Biden or any other  president.  But there are things that Biden has done to make things better for us.You‚Äôre getting played by the republicans and we‚Äôre all getting played by the wealthy.  Do you think they care about you and how inflation affects you?  No they don‚Äôt care because they can afford higher prices.People think it‚Äôs a race problem or it‚Äôs a religion problem or it‚Äôs a gun problem or a bunch of other stuff.  It‚Äôs not centered on any of those things.It‚Äôs about financial equality first.  There will never equal justice without financial equality.  That is what Lincoln was trying to accomplish - financial equality for everyone.  The abolition of slavery was a result of that.I highly recommend that series from PBS on Lincoln for everyone.   It was amazing to see how he had to learn some things on his feet.   The republicans back then are not what we have today.I‚Äôm going to have to watch that again.Take care dude, keep those eyes and ears open.
Tax dollars going to war dude its 2023 where u been‚Ä¶..
That‚Äôs not the original report and she only mentions her source after the LIVE reporting on her twitter keep trying to use random shit, it‚Äôs so funny that you try to use Muslim bullshit yet you don‚Äôt know what I am but continue. you 300lb tub of lard, you know your big papa doesn‚Äôt like it when you play with your dog with ur handy jar of peanut butter
Here is her original report and interview of the soldier.  No one says all 40 babies were beheaded.  You have been proven wrong and have no evidence against me other than your lying words.   You know Allah sees what you do with the goats and that is Haram.https://www.i24news.tv/en/news/israel-at-war/1696938010-it-smells-of-death-here-surveying-the-scenes-of-atrocities-in-kfar-aza
Wow  I never thought I‚Äôd agree with anything he ever said
I guess these kids were just chilling in their houses without parents and needed help, so Hamas came in and helped the poor kids with their own real estate but no families.
Israel wouldn‚Äôt be killing civilians if hamas wasn‚Äôt using their citizens as shields and instructing them to ignore the warnings and orders to evacuate. It‚Äôs odd how people are so quick to minimize the atrocities of an actual terrorist group, while at the same time criticize Israel‚Äôs completely necessary retaliation.
She did in her original reporting on live television you troglodyte
Again my point still stands she never said all 40 babies were beheaded you goat breading liar.
It‚Äôs so funny u linked me the same reporter THAT LITERALLY SAYS on her Twitter that she only heard about the baby‚Äôs and never saw it or even verified the source You donkey just hush hush hop off the internet if you don‚Äôt know how to use it
I want to know how a human being can become this cruel.
Wrong.  Find me a video that says that.  These all clearly show 40 babies killed "some" beheaded.  Your understanding of English may not be that good but no real news organization ever said all 40 babies were beheaded.https://youtu.be/6dQjmXLbEHM?si=qfCv0xykBf3k0cOthttps://www.thejc.com/news/israel/hamas-terrorists-murdered-40-babies-including-beheadings-says-report-2fdcCmtBjFvAcCCf5MDwKU
Common Sense will tell you just to give them back to their parents. After how they paraded the girl around in the back of the Toyota truck I don't think their trustworthy babysitters
God and the SOF will protect these kidsüôè
Also called ensuring their own self preservation you want to say hey don‚Äôt strike my hideout, have some of your enemies babies there..
That's unfortunately true they probably will.  But those kids were sentenced to death when they were taken just like the thousands of other innocent people taken by them over the years.  The only thing that will stop that cycle is destroying Hamas.  As for the people living there they picked and supported Hamas and you reap what you sow.
I remember back when i was an intern at a vet clinic we were given 5 kittens to send for cremation after they were found in a plastic bag filled with water and thrown in the trash. There were 6 kittens and only one survived. The team and I have never been so disgusted by mankind as in that day. The one kitten that survived managed to do well after that
Yea back home you harbor a criminal you get part of their punishment, even worse when your harboring murderous terrorists it‚Äôs time Gaza learns the harddddd way
Interception
Im black and if someone told me that I wasn't if I didn't vote for them, then I'm not going to vote for them. Trump was a big supporter of the black community before he even became president. During his presidency my income was the same yet I could afford 2x the amount of goods I can now. Our country was stronger and we had greater peace in the world. You can hate the guy but have to admit he was the best leader America's had in a long time and we need him back
‚ÄúIn essence‚Äù is how you know this was written by chatGBT. OP can fuck right off the bat
They literally said and I quote ‚Äú40 baby‚Äôs were beheaded‚Äù this was from a Israel‚Äôs reporter. She said she heard it from a IDF solider
well said
Clogged up hospital full of just fighting age males? Take a full minute of what you just said and think that can‚Äôt be the case. u bomb a 150miles with 6000 bombs in three days
I've realized I don't really like either group at the end of the day. Everyone in our society is now forced to pick a side and fight about it. I'm sick how everyone does that about everything now.
Both sides have committed barbarian like attacks on civilians. In the same way you can't blame all Palestinians for hamas attacks the same can be said about the civilians due to IDF attacks ect.Other countries can take some blame for these tensions as well. The British just up and left, the US supported a government coup in IRAN which has caused nothing but problems.When Iran didn't want to be a US puppet anymore the US switched up and became friends with Saudi Arabia.While I don't blame Israel for the entire conflict they do operate the world's largest open air prison blatantly in front of everyone. You can't treat people like animals especially when culture and extreme versions of religion are involved.All in all this is honestly just one big mess. I can't imagine how peace will ever be achieved while hamas kills civilians and Israel retaliation involves carpet bombing refugee camps.The height of these conflicts from what I have read recently started specifically due to Israel kicking Palestinians out of their homes in Jerusalem and giving them to Israeli citizens.And the worst thing is civilian's always suffer the most especially children.
I'm very well aware of the situation. Yes it's totally wrong what they did. But there are a lot of innocent people in Gaza just trying to live their lives. Yes there were a bunch of people there celebrating and condoning the violence against this girl and against Israel. It doesn't mean everyone in Israel deserves to die. Violence on this level will bring even more violence and only continue a never ending cycle of death. Some compassion needs to be shown to the innocent ones trying to just get by and live a normal life. Murdering everyone in Gaza is an action at the level of Hamas. Gaza is already being systematically bombed and the next phase of assault is about to begin. Even Israel doesn't believe that everyone should be killed in Gaza and they have told over a million people to leave there immediately as the ground assault will begin. If Israel went into Gaza and murdered everyone it would cause a serious backlash from the other Arab states. What you're calling for will only lead to more deaths on a massive scale, possibly to the point where world war 3 finally starts. Now imagine all of the innocent people who will die because of this. Simply caught in the crossfire. You need to seriously take some deep breaths and think about what you're saying. You're talking about a genocide level of response.
Calm down we're just talking and of course when a colonizer comes to you're country and try to take you're land you're gonna try defending it and i'm not defending Hamas for killing innocent people and Israel soldiers did attack helpless women and children and kicked them out of their home before this Hamas war happened, you're saying that Palestine deserve what's happening to it right now because it attacked innocent Israelians, but Israel doesn't deserve what happening to her even tho they also attacked innocent Palestinians
I would say that Israel has already shown restraint by continuing to try to tell people to evacuate. It is certainly more than many other nations would do in the same circumstances. If this were happening to the US or pretty much any other sovereign nation with the same military capabilities I‚Äôm pretty sure this would be just about over and there would not be much left in the wake of vengeance.
Don't matter they had no right to take them don't believe everything on the internet
It's not.  There is documented proof (and yes, photos) as so many like you tried to spin it this way.  Hamas is pure evil, has always been, and they are about to get wiped out I hope (from the River to the Sea to borrow their phrases).  Sow a whirlwind, REAP a whirlwind I say....
Wow. Well done. Took a blade to the heart of the issue.
That, and we had Reddit, Facebook, and (former) Twitter taking down anything that didn‚Äôt align with their own viewpoints.
I don‚Äôt, I support the freedom and liberation of the indigenous people Palestine. It‚Äôs the Israeli Zionist who are bombing innocent civilians for the past 80 years. The entire world is watching the barbaric and savage acts of the Israeli army. The time has come where the people have had enough.
‚ÄúWhile the Iranian government claims it can use the money however it pleases, the Biden administration has repeatedly stressed that the funds are narrowly limited to non-sanctionable purchases like food and medicine, and that they will be subject to strict oversight.‚Äù.  (CNN).     Biden has ZERO control over Iran and everyone with half a brain knows it.
This makes me sick... thinking their parents are dead somewhere nearby... not to mention the possibility they made this video as propaganda and making these kids feel safe and loved and then killing them and severing their heads... I pray these children are still alive somewhere safe.
They will... but probably so will the kids along with thousands of other civilians. God be with them.
Yes but Einstein's are few and far between...
100% this would traumatize me if I was a garbage man...they all deserve better.
Every soldier is coward?
That is mearly due to limitations on people's ability to innovate. The best ideas are often developed by people who cannot access higher education. Large parts of the world are stuck in poverty. The next Einstin could very well be starving and dying of thirst right now.
so what money do you think  something happened to  it?  lets have it... lets get to the bottom of your stupidity. not the 6 billion in Qatar that can only be used for humanitarian aid. that 6 billion? Can only be used by a third party humanitarian organization? you meam the six billion that has not been touched yet?  take your own advise follow the money stupid.
Israel is not trying to commit genocide, it's occupying it. Stop framing it this way
Completely agree though this is the reason that the war just continues. The belief that a soldier is worth more than a child.It should not matter what race or creed the child is, a child should always be protected above all else as a child enacts such emotion in every civilised person and is always innocent. By putting a child's life as more important than a soldier you have a chance of changing the perpetual violence. It should not matter what horrors have been committed by the adults, if a child is not worth more than a soldier or other adults life then those killing the child are not worth anyone's support. I started by saying I believe Hamas' should be eradicated and truly stand by that. But anyone who kills a child indiscriminately and not by accident should also be eradicated as all should be striving for a better society rather than lowering oneselves to their enemies level and becoming as evil as them in the name of the greater good.
Must be difficult to properly monitor something as this.   I really wonder how much actual value is in sharing those(as well other) atrocities. I've developed such a defeatist attitude - the bare minimum is keeping yourself and your "loved ones" safe. That's it. I do not see how I can do more than that and it is a crushing, yet familiar, experience. Sharing stuff might help. Maybe somehow. Be it fake, as long as the target is right.. a dangerous line of thought, but not entirely wrong.
Why do you support the killing of civilians. You are no better than Hamas. You are happy when civilians from Israel die. How you are in your head. You defend the slaughter of civilians.
Pretty fucked up that success in this war will be measured by who killed the most innocent ppl. That's most wars I suppose... humans are too stupid still to have the technology we possess. We are a bunch of regarded tribal apes. This is why the aliens wont let us travel the cosmos yet or possibly never. Our brains need a few hundred thousand more years of evolution first.
Propaganda will be on both sides brother. The first casualty of war is the truth.
I agree, but Hamas doesn't have the sophistication or technological ability to do that. Would they if they could? Probably not, as I speculate Hamas has passed the point of no return in their evil. Now lets hope Israel does not do the same. I fear they are doing the same, as they are not doing "knock bombs" now. Where do the civilians go? Into the sea to find peace? God be with these all these ppl on both sides, bc humanity left long ago.
Sounds about correct a bunch of made up shit to make peoples emotion flare just to really do what u said the other side was doing
Censorship hurt itself in the confusion. There were lots of videos posted by Hamas themselves showing the shit they were doing. So many places took them down, and so we're left with the governments of the world going "Trust us bro. We saw the video" - but these are governments who have been caught telling lies in the past. So people just don't believe anything any more.
Both sides are killing civillians. In the end it will come down to who kills the most civillians. So far Israel seems likely to out do hamas due to cutting off Food &amp; Water to some 2.3 Million people.
Do yoi also feel that hamas should think of every human life first?  They clearly don't. Isreal has tried to be the bigger person and end the cycle.  They have offered a 2 state solution 5 times.  Palastein is the one who refuses.Hamas, got democratically elected to lead the Gaza strip on a platform of destroying isreal and killing all the jews.  It is in their charter.   And they were elected in 2007.  They have the support of the majority of the population.And they don't spare any isreali life
Good luck!
Who cares if it is real... Either way you stole children from their parents...  probably killed the parents too.  I hope they all die.
And hamas would happily murder the people trying to defend them.
They would fill it within a day.
I should have been more clear in the title. I do not forgive Hamas. The perpetrators should be justly punished. The two sides I'm referring to would be Isreal and Palestine. The fighting has been going on for so long. Some generation must find a peaceful agreement and stop fueling and passing the problem onto the next generation.
Israel has some of the most sophisticated weaponry in the Middle East and is one of the ONLY nations to make an active effort to reduce civilian casualty sending knock bombs, direct calls, texts and emails begging people to leave buildings before they are destroyed. That cannot be said of the Palestinian Hamas group.
To me it looks like good guy propaganda, they're always trying to look good in the eyes of the international community who don't hold the same moral values as them. Their main goal is to trick people into thinking that they have done nothing wrong and Israel orchestrated and lied about the entire attack.
They captured hundreds of women and children and took them back to Gaza. You can only imagine some of the horrors they are enduring currently as was confirmed by recently interrogated Hamas soldiers
Please go check out what Willie Pete does to  any human.
I posted on clip of this but to me it looks like they are using children as human shields. If they were looking after the children you‚Äôd think they would safeguard them and send them to a hospital, religious temple, or any other non-combatant facility.Keeping them with you is placing them in harms way. I can only speak from my own perspective in the US military but we were trained to turn unaccompanied minors over to civil affairs types or local authorities. We definitely were not allowed to take them with us as combatants.
Basically there is an area inside Israel which has been given to a group of people (largely Muslims). As of 2005 Israel has left the Gaza Strip and the West Bank to the self governance of the people there. They held an ‚Äúelection‚Äù in 2006 in which the people elected Hamas as the governing authority. The whole point of this group is the establishment of a Palestinian Islamic state in place of Israel which is where you hear the chant ‚ÄúFrom the river to the sea, Palestine will be free‚Äù. This group has rejected EVERY peace deal offered to them by Israel, and does not wish to rest until the Jewish people are driven from the area. Most recently they have launched hundreds of rockets into Israel killing a bunch of people. They parachuted/hang glided into a dance/music festival and executed as many as they could. Hundreds of soldiers stormed Israel‚Äôs borders and ran through its cities killing, mutilating, and kidnapping its citizens and committing heinous war crimes. This is a giant powder keg of a situation here because the likelihood of many other countries being sucked into this conflict is VERY HIGH. You have the Temple Mount in Israel which the Jews want to take back desperately. It has been under Muslim control, but this latest bout of conflict is as good a reason as they are going to get to retake it. IF THAT HAPPENS then every neighboring Muslim country will have something to say about it. The temple aside, Palestine has been getting its weapons from Iran which in turn has been supplied from Russia and China all of which side with Palestine. The US has historically sided with Israel in all of her conflicts and this is no exception. We already have several assets in the area to deter other countries from entering as well as providing support to Israel. Hezbollah is another group that has roughly 150,000 rockets pointing at the north of Israel. If they launch those rockets then Israel will essentially annihilate the southern border of Lebanon. Supply lines into Lebanon run from Syria which Israel will likely destroy as well. If they do that then Syria would obviously respond which means that Israel would likely strike bases in Syria as well. This would surely draw Iran into the conflict which means Russia is involved and we are at the brink of WW3. NO ONE wants this, but these people groups have demonstrated that they cannot live together and that there will never be peace. This conflict will be likely be long lasting and from what I can tell, if I were a young man in the US I would start seeking weapons training and start to get physically fit to be called to war.Edit: spelling
What is the source? Where did this video come from?
First blood was infact drawn by Israel, don't forget that Israel isn't innocent , they kicked Palestinians from their home ans violently attacking children and women and violated their basic human rights, violence was the only way to get some of their land back, it worked but it will not be worth it and if what happened to Palestinians happened to someone, he'll grow hate over Isrealians
Temporary and without the bombs preferably.
If you think not agreeing with genocide, justifying genocide is judgy, then you have a lot bigger problems than Israel and Palestine. You clearly do not have a fundamental understanding of this conflict. And you seem a little unstable. Good luck with that
Wrong.
I know someone who drives a trash truck for our town and he found a ball python covered in mites outside by a set of trashcans. The habitat was entirely too small and was disgusting like it hadn't been cleaned in months. He's also found cats before too. Its insane
[I just wanna talk to him](https://imgur.com/a/wOGaD7J)
So like Gaza but in Egypt
I'd probably try to fight against those pig fucking Hamas inbreeds!
Agreed. And I feel like the rest of the world is just quietly letting Egypt off the hook here.
Look I'm more on Israel's side than anything. But Israel has done some pretty bad things to the Palestinians as well. I'm not saying it makes it okay for what they did. What Hamas did was uncalled for. But it doesn't justify harming every single person in Gaza. There are many people there who don't support what Hamas did. There are also people there who suffered greatly because of what Israel has done to them. Yes Hamas deserves to be punished but it's also dad to see the everyday people having to suffer even more. You're allowed to be upset but you can also have some compassion for those who don't deserve to be caught in the middle of this.
According to a prior post you live in Tunisia?
That's what I thought as well.
Both Jews and a mish mash of different Arabs known as Palestinians were offered a homeland during WWII.  Jews needed a homeland, and eventually they took matters into their own hands and declared Israel.   5 anti semitic Arab countries attacked Israel in response.  Israel kicked their butts and claimed more territory - to the victor goes the prize.  Hamas has been peddling a 70 year old lie that Jews were going to destroy the Al-aqsa Mosque and use that as pretext for repeated terrorist attacks against Jews.  The recent attack by Hamas was called operation "Al-aqsa Flood", again referring to the Al-aqsa Mosque as their 'cause' against Jews.
I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs propaganda to appeal to the world
And it sounds like you shouldn't be so judgmental. Because what he said is the truth the Palestinian people cheered on in the streets of Gaza as we watch dead bodies of innocent people get paraded around in a Toyota while people spit on her and hit her with a club. Not to mention they raped her consecutively before they beat her and put her in the back of the Toyota and you're going to tell that person that it's a hate comment? Are you kidding me where have you been living under a rock? Apparently you don't have the proper morals. The bottom line is this the Palestinian people supported this terrorist group, their city will be reduced to Rubble. Maybe you should turn your television on and watch how the Palestinian people cheered with their guns in the air while they beat and spit on the poor girl that they raped consecutively.
So when did this piece of shit care about civilians and the shedding of blood?
Where is the proof it is ai generated?
"civilians" Hamas Propaganda.   Just look at all the fighting age males clogging the hospital floor where civilians should be the ones being treated.
They did it Themselves... &amp; in Their Own Cereal, too!
You'll become a dehumanised pathetic peace of shit if you work in an animal shelter, interesting
There is no stopping this war, Hamas drew first blood, Palestine supports them with their actions parading innocent victims in the streets of gaza, and now they're finding terrorists in Rafa on the border of Egypt where they are targeting now. Egypt knows their housing terrorists then obviously they're going to get drawn into a blown out or because of the city of Rafa. Israel at least gives notice before they bomb. Hamas doesn't give any notice to Israeli civilians this is a ridiculous situation of people supporting Palestinian and Hamas when they're the ones praising death to the Jewish this is really ridiculous, they got what they get coming to them they will be reduced to Rubble, Ham-Ass, Asses of Ham,
In hell there are no innocent ppl.
Who wants the good possibility of letting terrorists into your country.  I'm not in any way saying the Palestinians are terrorists, only that a percentage of those that flee will be, albeit a small percentage.  Egypt relies on money from outside for their economy, this problem spiling over across their border isn't beneficial for anyone in the region. It is sad bit it is a very different set of circumstances than Ukraine.
They are doing a much better job at hiding the footage than they did with Ukraine. I believe it is bc in Ukraine that is technically a "war". This is "terrorist activity". I mean... it's all semantics IMO. War is war... and it's hell. This is certainly hell on earth for both sides.
What are you even talking about? Who mentioned old people or said no one cares about them?
No, just you
It's a fair argument IMO. We don't need another war and millions more refugees arriving on our shores. For fuck sakes we need to stop being so emotional as a species and stop killing each other over tribal bullshit.
Read 1984
Tell me something that's new... Anhilation of Palestinians is not a crime as long as Isreal does it in the name of self defense
They also built a wall already to keep them out of Egypt.  I'm not sure why but I assume there was a reason.
zzz
Egypt should step up to the plate, Israel is finding Hamas terrorists in their country and they're taking them out in Egypt as well, Egypt is hiding their head in the gravel afraid of what could happen if they're harboring more terrorists. They should open their door to the women and children
I don't get it either....so who are the captives? How did they get captured by Hamas? Is Isreal striking purely because the Hamas got someone really important?
putting them in plastic bags and dumping them in the trash isn‚Äôt abuse?
Yeah there is not a lot of logical thinking going on with the Arab countries IMO. Then again you could say the same about Israel. They are going to want the west to absorb all their "terrorists" yeah no thanks.
I'm am not sure you understand what that word means.... üòÖ
Yes they are smarter than western countries in this sense... they know that Canada will let them all in, as Trudeau has never met a terrorist he didn't like...  and they can cause problems there for other societies. It's a good strategy if you think about it.
Killing jews is way more important to them
Yes. Where they are now is much worse than hell.
They have a peace treaty with Israel they tried helping back when it first got taken over
lot of secondary explosions for a "school" eh...?
I would say what they are living in right now is closer to hell.
American Airforce, their navy is the second most powerful Airforce in the world
Definitely! I think Egypt has a responsibility here, but they choosing to ignore the mess on their doorstep.
When the media puts these key buzz wordsHamas Beheads 40Children/babies People will take what they see and hear Shocking stuff from the west AI imaging and atrocity
I wouldn't be surprised... but that would only prove that terrorism is a weed that wraps themselves around wheat. The angels of God will separate them in the end.
No one ever said 40 kids were beheaded by Hamas.  The report was 40 kids were murdered some mutilated and decapitated.  That doesn't mean all 40 were but some, even if just a few that is still horrible.
I would let elderly, women, and children through... but unfortunately for men... they would need to be screened. I mean, even women will carry resentment, so they'll probably just end up raising hatred and continue this vicous circle.
We never recieved any text nor anyone i know and our neighberhood is gone its time to gtfo of this shit hole and fight with whatever we have and hope for the best against an occupier pussy with advanced technology and the support of super powers, fuck all yall you guys dont know how life is here  most kids i know are dead already.
i dont know where you heard that you delusional fuck but your wrong i never recieved any text  nor anyone i know and our neighberhood is gone fuck you and isreal its time to gtfo of this shit hole and fight with whatever we have and hope for the best against an occupier pussy with advanced technology and the support of super powers, fuck all yall you dont know how life is here
You'd think Egypt would be able to handle that though. Surely they could mark out an area on the Egyptian side and make a massive refugee camp that could at least assist with food and aid without allowing them to go further into Egypt. but hey if Arabs don't care about Arabs they making it pretty obvious right now.
Go work in an animal shelter for a summer and your view will change. It's not abuse when it's animal control.
That's all well, but when one side is mindlessly raping and killing children, it very hard not to pick a side.
Two tribes of apes have been embroiled in a conflict for centuries... then they got weapons that their brains aren't evolved enough to really use with any humanity. That's it in a nutshell.
Makes me wonder if he took them all home, released them to be strays or sent them to the pound to be "humanly killed" in an incinerator. Call me what you want but he should have left them there. Spay and neuter
I‚Äôm trying to gather information on this as it‚Äôs what everyone is talking about and I don‚Äôt like to assume things or base my opinions on what‚Äôs all over the media etc‚Ä¶ I‚Äôve been reading a ton of stuff and honestly it really seems very confusing. I‚Äôm trying to get a grasp on the larger conflict about the land if anyone wouldn‚Äôt mind helping me is this (the following) a somewhat accurate account of what the problem is. So originally thousands of years ago this disputed area is where Jewish people originated and live for generations. Then they were exiled/kicked out/fled. That area was then inhabited by another group who were or weren‚Äôt the direct cause of the Jewish peoples displacement (confused on this) who then live there for generations. Then after the holocaust Jewish people understandably wanted to seek out their homeland. When they arrived at said land the people who were living there didn‚Äôt/wouldn‚Äôt accept them or did the Jewish people attack and forcefully try to get these people to leave? Then at some point a global body intervenes and designates one part to the Jewish people and the other to the Palestinians. The Jewish people were happy/accepted this arrangement. The other side was not happy and continued to violently try to make them leave, but ultimately ended up with even less land then they had in the original agreement. I have so many more questions but I feel if I could at least get that bit sorted it would help
Genocide? They are a terrorist group you can‚Äôt kill a terrorist unit you can only suppress there belief for some time
Both sides feel they have a claim to the territory, they don't want to share and would prefer if the other side leaves, the other side doesn't want to leave so they fight.... blah blah blah blame the British.
It's fucked up but I agree that Caprice is a beauty. Shame what happened to the owner.But I'm not surprised most of y'all commented on the ride rather than the shooting lmao..
That and they dont want hamas militants sneaking in with refugees into thair countries
No that's mine, no it's not its mine, you can't have that I don't like you have these rockets, no I don't like you have some jdam. 70 some years of that.
Dead Arabs are great press for them.   They want this to happen.   Do you really think they don't know what Hamas is up to?   They are funding this.
I should not have watched this video.. I can‚Äôt handle what I just saw. Fuck.
Only because other animals haven't worked out plastic bags yet.
I advocate getting them to that special place in Hell BEFORE they die.
Except here, the invasion is a response to a massive terrorist attack, Russia are the terrorists. Big difference.
Both sides have their shitheads.
And it‚Äôs free too.
Ikr. What a hero :)
What‚Äôs the most powerful airforce in the world?
The Palestinians live in hell and this is how they were created. The Israelites treat them like monsters and that's what they have created. God has left this area a long time ago. That's what these ppl don't see... they made hell on earth.
Even in ideal situations, newborn kittens are incredibly hard to keep alive if momma isn‚Äôt in the picture.
He‚Äôs a Toro bull part time
Drowning is a better fate for cats than being thrown in the trash. If you drown them, they die fairly quickly, but if you throw them in the trash, they suffer a lot.
I was so happy when I saw they were alive.
Who cares about old people I guess... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
The short answer is tunnels. The Hamas organization is one of the best at creating intricate tunnel systems. I did my Capstone for my Masters on the relationship between the Mexican Cartels and Hamas. Essentially Hamas provides assistance and techniques on building the tunnels and in return Hamas gathers money and weapons. They are within the US.
This guy kidnaps.
This decision was taken for the health of the sub as a whole so polling isn‚Äôt appropriate when we could literally get banned entirely by the admins. This sub has always been a bit of a ‚Äògrey area‚Äô in terms of what is/isn‚Äôt allowed so we‚Äôre having to take some preventative measures. Ideally we would just leave everything that‚Äôs not illegal and let the upvotes/downvotes do the work but as we all know this is Reddit so that rarely works out in practice. This the fairest way to deal with the situation given the circumstances but the rule is subject to change as things settle down. In the meantime there are plenty of other places you can use to view/post stuff about it and there is an abundance of other awful shit happening that you‚Äôre free to post here.
So just because Hamas is bad, we should kill everyone in Gaza regardless of whether they support Hamas or not?
That's the problem... there is nowhere for them to evacuate to... situation is beyond FUBAR.
Yeah... it's messed up... Hamas needs to go but it is very sad for so many ppl. I don't believe cutting off the water was a good idea. You can't cut off the water to innocent children.
I suspect civilian firearm ownership will go up now in Israel and be made easier.
My grandma's old cat, she got from a situation like this.  My mom and my aunt were still teenagers at that point.  As my mom told the story, their neighbor had a female cat who got kittens, but the owner didn't want to take care of the extra cats, so instead of bringing them to a shelter, he put them in a bag and started smashing it into a wall.  My aunt caught that and confronted him, to which he responded by telling her she could have the bag; otherwise, he would continue.  So she ran to my grandma to ask for help, and they both went to confront the neighbor again and ended up taking the bag with them.  Most of the kittens were dead, but of the 3 that survived, 2 went to a shelter to be adapted, and one my grandma kept and named Lyda until Lyda died of natural causes a few years back.
99% of those people had underlying conditions which left them with a weaker immune system.
Sounds like you have become what you hate.
So it's a gang.
This isn't the same. This is someone putting an entirely different species in a plastic bag and disposing of them in a trash can.
You want holocaust? no I want holocaust.
That‚Äôs why bullrings are a thing.
Probably corruption from parties of Israel and other surrounding countries turning a blind eye for $$$$
TY
For sure. I guess my question was more how does Iran get the weapons to Gaza?
Was talking with some coworkers 20yrs ago and 1 tells a story that he driving his sportscar down street and sees a black garbage bag in the middle of his lane and decides to speed up and blast through the bag have trash every where. It was a car battery. Car is fukcdSecond coworkers story similar but he resist urge to hit bag and discovered four kittens. Now I see a garbage bag in the street I picture in my mind both.
Ah that makes sense. I didn‚Äôt think about tunnels. I was wondering how they‚Äôd get enough guns to fight a war into a ‚Äúopen air prison‚Äù. The place is literally walled off so I was just confused how they get all their equipment and guns
Noah get my gun someone's dying
Yeah I‚Äôve seen that. I was more wondering the physical aspect of getting guns into Gaza. Isn‚Äôt there only two entrances/exits that are heavily monitored? And one is on the isreal side? I just don‚Äôt see how they could sneak enough weapons through a border crossing to fight a war with. I‚Äôm probably just missing something or don‚Äôt quite understand the state of Gaza
I read the title and subconsciously read one extra word at the end that made it far worse: compactor
If I got stung by a hornet and when I went to kill the nest, they were highly advanced hornets with tanks and thousands of bombs. I would probably not touch that nest and figure out how to not get stung again.
Eat them if they are hungry. Kill them if they are males. Kill them if they don‚Äôt belong to the same group or family‚Ä¶
What I wonder is.   What did Gaza think would happen after the attack they pulled ?   Of course isreal would go HAM amd bingo the fuck out of them.  Isreal is 10x the military power Hamas is.    Iran put then up to it in sure.  But is Iran gonna step in ?
Some people are hypocrite, they'll cry over what's happening to Israelians and ignore what Palestinians went through for over a decade
Amazing what minds of a free world can manifacture....i cleary can see the results of hamas occupite country can produce...
OP is reasoning with your post, and it‚Äôs appreciated. I want to add: This is the Hamas constitution. https://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/hamas.aspIt clearly violates international law. That you‚Äôre so focused on Israel‚Äôs transgressions and not what they‚Äôre fighting against is likely due to Gaza having 1.6 billion Arabs support it, and the combined worldwide population of Israelis and Jewish people sits at a mere 18 million. If you want to hear both sides, one really needs to be sought out.
Yes but it most likely is too late for the kittens, I mean I can't really see them moving in the video and even if so it would surprise me/I would call a bluff because such a bag is air tight meaning they would have most likely had not enough oxygen within minutes
Is that a bull or a cow? Either way‚Ä¶WTF!?
Hamas fighters and financial supporters should face Game of Thrones type justice. Slowly.
Good job it's in a sport that requires a shitload of running. Wonder if it happened at a weightlifting contest they'd just face the bull down.
I‚Äôve watched countless of videos of Israeli troops abducting children, women, and boys, arresting men abruptly without cause. Evicting Palestinians from their only homes to give their homes to Israelis. No act of violence is justified but we must not fail to recognize that the Palestinians did not cause this violence, nor did ‚Äúterrorists‚Äù but a frustrated, disenfranchised, people who had no future, death almost but certain by the Isrealis and joined a collective cause to air their grievance through violence since the international community turned its back on the occupation of Palestinian. The invasion of Palestine is a violation of human rights and international law just as much if not more than the invasion of Ukraine by Russia.
How dare you wish this kind of filth on cancer.
We must ask ourselves if Israelis are are any better than the Natzis?

Is that freedom I hear?
Gotta use that turn signal when you merge into traffic
I don‚Äôt blame Israel as a whole, I blame their government. I don‚Äôt blame Palestine, I blame Hamas. Under apartheid, Israeli authorities control virtually every aspect of Palestinians' lives and subject them to daily oppression and discrimination through territorial fragmentation and legal segregation. THIS has been Palestinians' reality for decades particularly, the last 11 years. That said, Israel must free Palestine and give them their land AND Palestine MUST end the Hamas regimes rule IMMEDIATELY.
Who's the big white dude at center?
Cats don't suck nearly as bad
Who thought that was a good idea??
I hope you drown I'm a pool of ur own shit there's children there u sick fuck

Must have dug them out of a PETA dumpster.
The gigachad cat
Better three living than none.
Yeah, it's definitely not the worst thing that can happen with unwanted animals
This.
Fucking monsters. A cat that usually comes to my house but doesn't stay once got pregnant; we let her have the puppies and then cared for them until they were adopted.I literally can't fathom someone just throwing puppies at the bin
Glad to see they're alive. Fuck the dude who threw them and thank the workers
I don't know but Sean Dyche would probably want to sign him
Well, that's just not on.
As another comment mentioned, if he would have left, management would have said why didnt he try to stop it
You're right about the holy land but i think the hatred over Israel and Palestine is not something about muslims and jews it's something more about the Arabic gouvernement and the Israelians gouvernement and they use their religion as an excuse to attack each other
at least it has the best outcome! the kittens got rescued and the pos that did this has to live with the guilt of thinking they killed them.
Nice. Free Israel
üëè well played sir
The difference is probably the kittens being alive. Sure a dead cut up baby is sad as hell, but it's dead. An alive baby would probably get the same reaction as the alive kittens. Both could've been adopted or avoided being born in the first place. But some asshat decided to toss something alive in a bin so the garbage collectors and sorters get traumatized. It's so much awfulness is one action. I hope people that do this get the same cancer I had because they deserve that suffering
I have so many questions and I want 0 answered
The person who did this should suffer even worse.Fucking cunt
George!! GEORGE...I have a great idea... let's bring a bull to the game as a mascot. Team playes in a colour strip - Red.

BUDDY ISREAL GOES ON KILLING SPREES EVERY DAY IN PALESTINE
You raise some valid points. However, what you are suggesting has been attempted before and it doesn't work. Again, while Israeli leadership has made many mistakes, each time Israel and Gaza had a conflict Israel attempted to fight in a lawful humantrian manner as possible at least on the larger scale (Ofcourse there were fuck ups). Attempting to reduce civilian casualties, for example, until recently, before every air strike Israel would warn the civilians in multiple channels regarding the impending attacks. However, Hamas would stop citizens from leaving, using them as human shields, manipulating the worlds opinion. Even now, when Israel is openly warning Gaza of an impeding invasion in the north and asking citizens to evacute, Hamas and Iran are spreading misinformation about it being an Israeli psychological warfare.The truth is, not only Hamas, but the major Islamic powers all see their civilians as a tool to be used and disposed. Even now, while condeming Israel, Egypt does not allow refugees from Gaza to cross to their terrtory.I agree that one of the primary lessons that can be taken from WW2 is both sides taking accountability and working together to build peace. I hope, that after this conflict ends it would happen here as well, though sadly I find it unlikely.But, most importantly, such thinga can happen only after there is a clear decisive victory. And such a victory sadly demands alot of casualties. Demanding Israel to continue fighting humanly while Hamas is using human shields is unrealistic.It puts the ground forces at too much of a risk, and asking Israeli soldiers to die for Gazan civilians is not only unrealistic, but also unfair.
When some one comes in your house and kicks your dog what would you do ?
I‚Äôll add that China is also highly corrupt and after living in China for years, I‚Äôm not convinced they could muster the logistics to pull it off.
There is no such thing as just walking into an island with the very few potential landing spots being zeroed in and mined, a terrain that could support Gorilla warfare for years, and one of the best equipped modern militaries on earth. Taiwan could hold out for a long time without any extra support being given.
I start by agreeing that Hamas' needs to be eradicated, they are terrorists.But.Israel is a state and should abide by the rules that the majority of the world feels are fair, if not people will criticise and it will cause further hatred fueling future problems. Agree that will happen no matter what but less likely if the worlds rules are followed and will hopefully lessen the chance of mass retaliation.That said this means that Israel should think about every human life first and do as much as possible to keep collateral damage to the minimum. This is hard in a densely populated area but we are seeing no attempt currently.The history of Gaza can be likened to a large concentration camp, something that hits home on every westerners psyche. It's not right to treat a whole population in this way and most people agree. Currently basic human needs are being denied to the whole population. This is only fuelling the resentment of the people there and who sympathise around the world.Most people agree that Europe was too harsh on Germany after World War 1 and that the actions fueled the uprising. The actions of both sides in WW2 were horrific and we are very lucky that they were accepted by both sides as justified which has lead to peace after the war ended. Unfortunately this is not true in Israel and Palestine and both do not agree with the others actions in the same way Germany and Europe seemingly did.At some point someone needs to become the bigger person and break the cycle of violence, unfortunately it looks less and less likely that this will happen soon.
Yea other species eat their young, kill them if they are smaller, leave them to die if they are too weak, etc.
People doing this deserve hell more than any other human, its just the cold-heartedness that makes me think the POS behind it wants to see the whole world burn or turn out to be a serial killer in the end

Id be so angy id back the truck up on the lawn of the house where they came from and dump all the trash on it.And if the owners came out id tell them trash belongs with trash.Yeah, id lose my job and probably face a civil lawsuit but my angry brain wouldnt be thinking of that.
I love the smell of Victory.
It would take every once of my will and better judgement not to march up to that door and give that homeowner/soulless demon and a well deserved knuckle sandwich.  If it didn‚Äôt mean being fired and destitute I would at least report to the authorities.  How cruel and despicable.  They could have at least let them lose there milk teeth and set  them at the edge of there yard or a park and gave them a fighting chance.
Anyone know if the cats fully recovered?
im still new to this thing i keep seeing biased opinions everywhere so can someone explain this situation without rooting for a side?
no
ü§î‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I like that one üëè
This makes me sad.
Why are there so many airstrikes?  It seems like artillery would be a much more cost effective way to attack Gaza.
Well, I can‚Äôt think of another species on this planet that would a) have trash and b) discard baby animals in the refuse. So, yuuuup
If 1,000 cats come together and dream of a world where they are the masters, and we are the pets, the world will be set right once more.
I'm so glad this is not nsfw
The guy in the video said one of them was dead. Being there, holding, and seeing them he's possibly a better judge than us, sadly.Edit: news article below says 3 out of the 5 survived, but the 2 that died appeared to have done so after the video, and after he tried to save them :(
Oh god oh god I know that episode
Some people are pure evil. Keep your pets indoors or in your yard with security cameras. Most pets can be leash trained. These are the sorts of people who probably had a smile on their face when they shoved this kittens in the bag imagining them suffocating. Absolute psychopaths.
I'm still here don't worry
Why was the other chap carrying a kitchen knife?!
I don't know man. Not all of them moved.
Excellent points. The UN should have closed all refugee camps within 5 years of the war‚Äôs conclusion. No one benefited by having this being an endless problem.
I'm right there with you, I know I'm fucked in the head, ican see gore and true crime all day long, in fact, I find it fascinating and very informational...but if someone is even remotely harming an animal I totally lose my shit. Of course, i have a soft spot for children, and in no way enjoy hearing about or seeing ANYTHING done to them, but for some reason, torture to animals really sends me over the edge.
I wonder how many billions you can sue for as an F.C. if someone injures several of your star players through negligence
I can't quite figure out why I find suffering kittens worse than a suffering baby...My logical brain says a suffering baby is much worse....but yet.....
I mean babies too, and well not in a good condition they often find them in parts
If you‚Äôre not going to add anything to the conversation do everyone a favor and fuck off.
Thank you for this and all your efforts to monitor this sub. I joined because I genuinely wanted to be kept up to date on the news of the current situation. There is plenty of other historical subs and articles for those looking for historical insight.
These kinds of dissapointments in humanity who would carelessly throw a live kitten to die in a trash bag i want to play people playground with.

I can't explain why, but it seems more disturbing to find a live kitten than a dead human in the trash....maybe it has something to do with the "subconscious need to defend a creature that can't defend itself"?
It showed that the Israeli people can actually take sand and build it into a gorgeous city. Like for real, they made nothing into something. Instead of letting it stay the same way, it would've 80yrs ago. There're innocent palestinians and Israelis that condemn HAMAS. The women, children , babies, and civilians have nothing to do with this war. Hopfully Any soldiers looking at this pls the little ones hav nothing to do with this. If they see you pls be their hero, not their monster.
Zionism
Thank you!
I could watch soccer if this was part of the game!
Oh my god those are _neo-nates_. Literally probably a week old
high chance that they wouldnt have made it to the facility alive either, as the hydraulic compactor in the truck likely would have crushed them.cant imagine what it would feel like to be crushed to death, but those kittens definitely werent in a happy place.
It is a legal issue if you care enough to research it. Joe has no control over it.
I'm so sorry that happened to you.
And Cats are way easier to give away than Dogs! They might cost about the same to feed, care for, and take to the vet, but they are usually pretty much independent and won‚Äôt grow to be 70 pounds lol.
Israeli families were murdered, whole families, that's genocide too.
If you‚Äôre gonna be an asshole, you could at least throw them in a box and take them to the park or something like fucking normal person. Not put them in apparently an extremely thick bag and *KNOT IT* shut. How could you live with yourself being so callous and cruel?
U.S. gives millions to Palestinians. In 2021, $150 million. You'd think improvements would be done. All I see is demonizing our country while they gladly accept our money.
Yeah, "talk"...
Can Jewish people start killing Germans because of the history? Can Koreans or Chinese start kidnapping and killing Japanese because of history?  Can African Americans start vandalizing random properties and target white people because of history? What is your logic?
Bro got extra lives from his dead brethrens.
Put the phone down and shoot those terrorist bro they have no right to be doing what they are doing to those innocent people
Jesus could they have opened the bag ANY SLOWER?!?
There is a special place in hell for people who do this shit.
It is fair to say that *only* humans are capable of this, though.
Don't forget abusing international aid. Alot of the fertaliser and water pipes that has been donatrd to help Gaza are reporpused by Hamas for the more basic rockets they use.
Agreed.
Red?
I didn't dare saying that, cause I have no idea of baseball and didn't want to offend anyone
Ngl, I‚Äôm not the biggest cat person in the world but this is fucked. I hate when I see this kind of stuff on Reddit. This is just too sad‚Ä¶people are fucked
I fear that America is taking itself out, unfortunately we will self destruct over time at the current pace.
Jesus Christ, dude you are really reaching here.It's very clear that 95% of the people on this damn subreddit don't know shit about the situation. Palestine is 50% childrenHamas is not Palestine , they are an ethno militant political group who uses terror as their primary microphone and have ruled over the Palestinian people with an iron fist since 2007. There are many Palestinians who support them but only because they have been completely and utterly shut off from the outside world and have no other option.If you could not leave your state because of a foreign military force while they force you out of your home and replace it with their people then bomb the place they send you to, would you not also side with the only group actively accomplishing any kind of resistance against the oppressing force?It is more than obvious what he is saying here and you misconstruing what he is saying and twisting it into your own interpretation is absolutely disgusting, especially accusing him of being complicit with the murder and rape of a people.I can perfectly understand why Hamas responds the way they do, and I can certainly understand why many Palestinians support them , do I think it's right? No of fucking course not, but I understand.That's all he's saying, he understands why, but he still condemns it.Absolutely shamefully disgraceful you are.

Try doing something delicate like this with those thick as fuck gloves
You‚Äôre an idiot
Hate Hamas not Palestine, Palestine is a place and Palestinians are a people, Hamas is a ethnomilitant political party that has ruled Palestine with an iron fist since 2007. More than half of the population in Palestine are children, are you telling me you hate children? Or are you saying that you hate Hamas? Be careful of the words you use my friend, not everyone can take back what they've said and when they will be saying never again 20 years from now for the genocide waged against Palestine Will you be amongst those who are considered complacent with their explosive holocaust?
This straight up made me cry. Humans are fucking garbage.
Iran as well.
I‚Äôm in awe constantly because nobody else seems to know what analytical or critical thinking is anymore.   The first line I meant as a joke.  But I appreciate that  you commented on that.  A lot of us need to be reminded to think for ourselves instead of being sheep.  The rest of what you had to say is a great explanation of what I was trying to say.thanks
I‚Äôm a UPS driver in the states and have had to call my local Humane Society on more than one occasion.It‚Äôs awful the way some people treat animals.
Vaccinated people still have caught it and died...
United States has said they have stationed the aircraft carrier in the region to deter other nations from escalating the war. I think this was primarily aimed at Iran but could be directed at anyone trying to provide aid to Hamas. The carrier should be in contact with US commanders who are in contact with the Israeli government/military and are likely passing information collected from the carrier strike group off shore (sonar and radar monitoring plus drone surveillance).If they have info on incursion forces, either friend or foe, they will likely just pass the info along rather than interfering directly unless the carrier group is at risk. If Israel requests assistance they may call up a strike package but it likely will depend on the scale of strike and likelihood of collateral damage.As for what kinds of forces would conduct such a rescue operation of hostages? The British SAS and the US Navy Seals come to mind. Most countries with special forces units will use them in such a situation. They would need to be small, highly skilled, and fast. They would likely be inserted between the air strikes and full ground assault and already in close coordination with Israel. Otherwise the likelihood of friendly fire is extremely high.
I believe in peace and justice. Not turn the other cheek. Not eye for an eye. I don't think 'you kill my kid so I can kill your kid' is okay.
Nope that isn‚Äôt lame nor conspiracy‚Äî this is called critical thinking and I highly encourage it üëç they are all Allie‚Äôs and communicate, and I suppose what you‚Äôre saying could possibly be true to an extent - weaken nato/America - spread them thinner than the need to be, to make a bigger attack potentially easier than without such worldly chess moves.
Even if the killing baby‚Äôs isn‚Äôt true, the world watch Hamas shoot up a festival just like American school shooters. You are so far from god if you support mass shootings you disgusting furry Animal.
Op sounds like he wants to go shoot up a festival. Or a school. Literally same shit.
I am a father and this hurts to see these innocent children like this.You poke the bear‚Ä¶ be ready for a response. They rattled the cage‚Ä¶ What did you expect? Israel‚Äôs military is no joke. Palestinians were such beautiful people until the extremists brain washed all of them. How many Israelites were killed? Americans were killed? Wipe these violent extremist off the planet. Tiny little speck of dirt in Israel‚Äôs land. This called collateral damage.
Burn this place
And I bet the person the was responsible for this had a cat as a "pet" but really it's just a toy to them. They don't even bother taking them to the vet or to desex them and just see this as an "inconvenience".
    That's where all the munitions are.
This is your friendly reminder to spay and neuter your pets. It prevents this problem completely.
So what do you do if your attacked? Peace has a price. It's often just like little kids. You hit me, I will hit you back harder until your tired of it. End hamas or any group like that in Gaza is the first step in peace.
Aye.
I'm surprised (and relieved) they're still alive.  With how tightly that bag was tied I was expecting them to have suffocated.Hopefully they're in a loving and happy home.
    Your daddy has done more for Isreal than any other president. He even canceled Hussein's deal with Iran.
Misanthropy
    Out of context. Listen to the speech.
Intelligent Person ‚â† Good Person
If people spayed and neutered their pets, this wouldn't be happening. Unfortunately, there are people who do these awful things.
And yes they smuggle it through the tunnels from Egypt

Valid point!
He needs to withdraw from public life.
BRO WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU ON LMFAO
What's most disturbing is, there's a big chance that other kittens (or abandoned animals inside garbage bags‚Äî I've even heard of HUMAN BABIES going through this same situation) aren't found in time, and they obviously die either from lack of oxygen or something more gruesome.Is there a way to find whoever did this? Maybe fingerprints or something?
History shows intelligent people took precautions and got vaccinated.
lol, just let go of the rope. You arent makin any decisions when its got like 800 plus pounds on you
Thanks, fo[und i](https://youtu.be/XrdIICKS0wo?feature=shared)t. That shit was needlessly dark, and so casual too.
It‚Äôs not normal in the country, it‚Äôs normal to sick heartless fucks. I grew up on a farm in the country and it always irks me when people say cruel things are ‚Äúnormal in the country‚Äù. They‚Äôre not, cruel is cruel regardless.
The plan all-along was to have the bull just *stand* there and look impressive.
He wanted to make sure others didn't ask him later, "Why didn't you *try* to stop him?"
The one where Tom dies, goes to the pearly gates, gets a piece of paper that Jerry needs to sign in order to forgive him of his misdoings so he can go into heaven. When he was at the gates, a wet trash bag landed at the gates full of kittens, implying that someone had drowned them and they had ended up there. Can't remember the name of the episode exactly, but it is definitely a classic one and not from any of the newer stuff.
Well, that bull really *warmed* them up!
I couldn‚Äôt agree with you more. This wrecked my night. People keep doing this (or bragging that  their grandpa used to do it on the farm, so it‚Äôs alright). I seriously want the cretinous scum that does this to be burned alive with acid.
Looks like it is to hold his tail up so when he shits it won't get on his tail.  Or it's on there to put the bull in a bad mood.
No see because Thanos was indiscriminate. It would just take a random 50% and blink them out of existence.We need a Thanos that seeks people who do this shit to animals and blink all of them out of existance.
He's a crowd pleaser!
I would very much like to find whoever did this and return the favor in kind.
I wish their mother would did this to those people who are doing this shit.
I would watch this for hours
Eradicate them
I can imagine as in where i live they usually find human remains too
They‚Äôre required so he doesn‚Äôt get injured?
A plastic bag with living animals inside of it. Holy fuck, you‚Äôre either an idiot or just that narcissistic.
That made my day, goodbye scum.
That‚Äôs a shit mindset. That type of mindset is why those that get falsely accused of a crime get locked up.
Is it wrong that my mind goes to the seven page muda?
A lot of work üòÜ
I have never had anything to do with the particular organ you mentioned.
hamas terrorists what soliders did you see there?!
The implications that could‚Äôve gone through with that garbage truck closing its back are horrifying. Whoever did that needs to be locked up.
Hammer of the GODS
If you didn't leave out the two women,  then why did you say 11 when it was actually 13?Bye.  Peace ‚úåÔ∏è
There is no force on earth that would have kept me from going to that door and dragging them out. People like that belong in the deepest depths of hell.
It'd be like pedos in jail minus the special treatment.I really can't understand this shit, I step on my cats tail by accident and feel bad. Shit one time I came home from work and his one eye was completely shut I was in fucking tears and I'm a grown ass man
Fux wrong with people
Whatever the fuck is wrong with people
The tom and Jerry one
Did the kittens live
No, an aircraft carrier allows a country to take complete control over the skies above another country.  These are massive ships, most actually have malls and restaurants inside them tbh.  They can sometimes transport spec ops teams. However this is not normally their role there are much cheaper more effective specialized ships for this. However the American navy does have the second most powerful Airforce in the world.  So this one aircraft carrier could probably decimate the combined armed forces of every country nearby.  They are also never alone, they travel with a group of high tech defensive and offensive ships.
This person is basically the best kind of person anyone can hope to be.
Palestine is as real as unicorns.
Does this really surprise us any more? Thousands of women murder their own children in the womb every year. If humanity devalues its own children so terribly, what hope is there for animal children?
Do people not realize you can bring them to a shelter? Like that is an option, they‚Äôre not going to make you keep them. They may not be able to take them but they can still temporarily hold them, find them a foster home, or transfer them to another facility. It‚Äôs insane how many people are truly so lazy and unempathetic that they‚Äôd rather kill the litter instead of simply driving to a local shelter and leaving them there.
Nah!
Told them to leave days ago. Said what was coming‚Ä¶.
And Israel who has been bombing innocent children in Gaza for the past 15 years?
Hamas boy speaking? Who is constantly terrorizing Israel with rockets?
The only terrorist are the Israelis that have been stealing land and killing the indigenous Palestinian people for the past 80 years
That‚Äôs what he gets for leaving the jazz. (Jk, Utahn here, bad joke.)
They will be raised as terrorist... raised with hate... against everything not allah-blabla... so... natural selection.
LIARS, ISRAEL ARE THE ONLY TERRORIST HERE
Was there followup? All I can tell at the end is "shit shitshitshitshitshitshitshit."
LIARS!
So you are justifying the killing of innocent children?? You are sickening, but this is typical of Zionist full of hate. They cannot be terrorist on their on land. The Israeli Zionist are the murdering terrorist who celebrate the killing of innocent people.
BEAUTIFUL! Level this Terrornest!
Shut the fuck up you muslim terror scum... fucking Allah screaming Bastards... gaza will be cleaned... baby killing fuckers!!!
Honest question.  Why doesn't HAMAS dig safety bunkers  for the people of GAZA? Why doesn't HAMAS allow the residents into the tunnels? Instead of leaving them to face the bombing themselves.I'm not looking to cause a fight. Just wondering.
Burn those terrorist bastards down!!!
This is the reason why I always go listen and check plastic bags that lay scattered around that look like they have something in them. I can't fucking stand shit like this
Damn it!  It was my lame ass attempt at starting a conspiracy theory and I failed.I wasn‚Äôt thinking that they‚Äôd come here, they wouldn‚Äôt have to because I think the economy across nations would fall apart.
It's Isreals fault that they are better a fighting than Hamas, and the PLO?
As long as what the Israeli terrorists are saying is true, good. Level the entire city. Even without taking Israeli word for truth, good. Level that whole city which voted Hamas into power - just for the festival shooting alone. Forget beheading babies and killing families in their home. Forget all past terrorism on both sides, the world wants to see Hamas fully exterminated. They act like American school shooters. Godless fuzzy animals with guns.
Yep they lost. Is what it is. We ain't going back in a time machine and doing it different. Ppl need to get over that argument. Pick anything that happened 100 years ago and start complaining about it and how "If that didn't happen, X would be different" Yeah no shit, we ain't got a time machine though so...
Whoever is playing against team espana
Thank you so much, it really means a lot to me
Which one?
All this Allah knowledge- nooooo! üôÉ
Bro has never used a knife before. Turn the blade away from the kittens pls.
As someone who suffers from actual mental illness that makes life not worth living, gore has no effect. Personally don‚Äôt believe what the Israeli terrorists are putting out as fact and want to see it for myself to insure to myself that Israel is the lesser of the two evil terrorists here.
Terrorist Muslims crying hard now.
I think you're correct. This isn't "war footage" this is disgusting murdering of civilians footage.
Terrorist child?
96% of The PA and hamas leaders .....have Swiss bank accounts and tailored suits.
On top of how horrible it is for the kittens, the mother must be devastated.
we have more nukes than them and we bombed Hiroshima and Nagaski üëçüèº Amerikkka was founded on the genocide of first nation natives, and funded by the Atlantic slave trade post independence from Brittain. Russia was founded by defeating the Mongols
No I'm not if you do your research and you go back in time you will see that the Muslims and the Jewish were always at war with each other this is a Biblical thing. Religion is 100% related to this because they are fighting over the Holy Land are you kidding me?
The Running Of The Bulls: Athlete edition
When hamas did this, this is the picture they wanted shown. Does it take a genius to figure out what would the Israeli response be, no. hamas gleefully threw the Palestinians into the grinder.... again. BTW where are the Hamas leaders at....no Gaza.
Your joke was shit you were making fun of soccer but you didn't know what was going on.
Someone could have painstakingly gone through 60 frames and used Photoshop on it.
What's so horrible is the fact that you could just drop them off at the shelter.
And here comes Hamas to chop the baby‚Äôs head off. Are you incapable of critical thinking?
No, most of the good ones are smart enough to get vaccinated.
I can‚Äôt, monsters!
Oml, what are the chances of him finding them before they were crushed and killed. So fucking lucky, I'd have to keep all of them if I found them!
I hurt for your heart. You did the best you could for those puppies. Because of you they weren‚Äôt alone but in a loving and comforting place with someone who cared when they passed.
I worked at a shelter and people would get pissed off when people left dogs in the lobby or cats in carriers when we were closed but god there are so many worse things they can do with an unwanted animal, I was always grateful they took the time to make that choice. (We were closed to owner surrenders because of space)
I take them all! Go off planet and then... press a button.
Breaks my heart I can understand how seeing this will put hate in your heart for those responsible!
We found a bag in some bushes on a walk around a lake road once. Most of the kittens were dead but one lived. It turned into the biggest baddest cat you've ever seen and lived to old age. Even dogs wouldn't mess with this feline.It's sad that they can't just try to get them adopted by someone or an agency with a no kill policy. Fixing your animals is also free a lot of times to prevent unwanted babies.
Without you, one night aloneIs like a year without you babyDo you have a heart of stone?Without youCan't stop the hurt insideWhen plane and jet collide
This kind of thing was happening before the boat came and after. Not gonna make a difference. People are insanely cruel.
It's a huge topic. If you want the latest it starts in 1914. Buddy you are just gonna have to dig deep. Problems on both sides but this was horrific. Watch some YouTube from real professionals on both sides. Its.... alot
Nope. America can sustain a 4 front war for decades and never run out of munitions. None of this distracts america from any other terrorist state like Russia, china, North Korea, so on. The only way to take out america is nuclear weapons which would end all life on earth including life at the bottom of the sea. Attacking America is a murder suicide, if done ‚Äòcorrectly‚Äô
Wife grew up on farm. Her Pa would drown the litter every year. It‚Äôs pretty normal in the country.Edit: Thanks to all the city folks for their downvotes. Feel free to drive out to the countryside this weekend and adopt a kitten. No? Well, then welcome to the reality of dealing with feral cats fucking.
And let‚Äôs not forget about Saint Reagan.   The person who gave Iran a shit ton of money to hold the hostages until after the election.  You know, the guy who got US citizens addicted and then overdose on heroin.
Why are people so fucking awful üòû
That‚Äôs one of those things those guys will remember for the rest of their lives.
Whichever one he wants...
96% of people who've died in the conflict since the 70s are Palestinian.This is literally projection.
Humans don‚Äôt deserve to be sentient
That‚Äôs a loser move based on fake news and bullshit.  Fox News and their top rated jizz heads even admitted it was just bullshit for the dumb asses.  Just as Chump said years ago - If I run for president I‚Äôll do it as a republican because they‚Äôre stupid.
Torino FC
This is a big if true type of thing huh?
Well I was sitting here in the airport having a drink.  Starting a vacation and now want to murder someone.  Who the fuck does this?  Terrible
Hamas chose this. They knew the outcome of their attack would be a swift and harsh counter attack. Hamas decided this was what they wanted. If Gaza didn't want this they would have removed Hamas years ago. No Muslim country wants to take in these people for a reason.
Wanton cruelty like this gets me so angry. There is no excuse for being the kind of loathsome miscreant that would do this. I wish there were much more repercussions for the people who do these wicked things. I hope that person's black empty soul somehow develops the ability to feel so they can keep thinking about what they have done and it tortures them. That and I hope karma deals them a hard slap of justice.
They will still require US aid. Be it ammo/ logistic help and financial aid. Not to mention the US keeps troops stationed on the border so it could become more complicated then the Israel situation if anything happens.
Omg, this makes me sick. How hard is it to drop them off at a cat rescue, or give them away if you don‚Äôt want them. I hope karma gets these people. Hope these babies got the right care and survived ‚ù§Ô∏èüôè. Thank you to the men that saved them!
I just want to talk to whoever did this‚Ä¶..
I‚Äôm amazed that people think that  there actually is a ‚Äòlake of fire‚Äô or that ‚Äòturning to Jesus‚Äô has ever had any effect on anything.
A limp dick.
The amount of shit that comes out of Trumps mouth is truly amazing.
Wouldn‚Äôt that also potentially kill lots of good people? Double edged.
I'm a big advocate for the special place in hell for animal abusers, where everyone else in hell knows what they're there for, and the demon guards just look away and let it happen.
Never said they want to interfere, just that they are the only ones who have something to gain. All they have to do is shelter and aid terrorist, Israel doesnt have the money or manpower or influence to go on a worldwide terrorist hunt like the US did and the US sure as shit aint doing it for them.As far as nukes go, thats not really a fear here, Iran has nukes as well. The MAD doctrine ensures nukes will always be a last resort, because there is no winner in a nuclear war.
Got the cut resistant gloves to impress the supe.
Or North Korea says F it and try‚Äôs with the south again. Was a report going around saying North Korea felt inspired by Hamas. Could be a crazy next few months/year that‚Äôs for sure.
What's even more tragic is the fact that this probably isn't a rare occurrence for bin men and workers who have to sort through the rubbish at the processing facility..humans are wicked..
American disinformation is far less effective because of the point the other guy made, ‚Äògrow up in Russia‚Äô The Russian soldiers who were told to dig trenches around Chernobyl seriously didn‚Äôt know any better and just did as they were told and died painfully. In America, far greater chance that one will educate themselves even to the point of knowing dictionary definitions for terms such as ‚Äòterrorism‚Äô. Easier for this to happen in America because of objectively better public education that leaves out political agenda for the most part. Russia is literally, by dictionary definition, a nuclear terrorist state. Nothing more, nothing less. Note, I didn‚Äôt mention anything about america being the good guys. I just know that nuclear terrorists are worse than regular terrorist because they can end my life in this irrelevant country without a single bomb dropping anywhere near me.
This is fucked up. They can't even see yet.
I don't think that Arabs will want to interfere in anything in this war, don't forget Israel have nuclear weapons,  using them will cause mass destruction in the whole middle east plus Arab countries have problems themselves and interfering in this will only make things worse for them
Netanyahu six feet under. Israel has nothing to complain about if they keep electing that idiot.
We need a real Thanos.

It wasn‚Äôt cut short by ‚Äú‚Ä¶the appearance of Hamas terrorists‚Ä¶‚Äù, it was cut short because they were indiscriminately being shot, raped and kidnapped.
Whichever club he wants.
The sick inhumanity of this is staggering. To bundle up such innocent defenseless animals in a garbage bag rather than just get rid of them at a shelter is unbelievable. The poor mother cat had her babies taken to be killed.It really strikes a nerve when I see things like this. Being a violent garbage person is one thing when you're out on the streets dealing with other adults, but to be that way towards something weak and defenseless like that is just unfathomable.
Thats why its hard to find?
Its awful how these people chose to throw them in a bag and toss them out like trash but wont drive out to surrender them to a shelter so they can find somewhere else to live.
Lucky it was just a bull and not an actual dragon that ran onto the field.
Why don‚Äôt they just move Israel to an area of Germany? Of course with German laws and German customs, not pushing out any of the Germans. Since Germany caused this mess in the first place. Or somewhere in the UK bc the UK gave them Israel ‚Ä¶ And non tolerant people aren‚Äôt allowed.

Don‚Äôt hate it all, just the stupid fanatics.
We need a stronger covid.
Excuse me ? Telling me to convert ? Is that even allowed like ? Really it seems you have NO RESPECT for other people beliefs
Don't know what that guy expected to accomplish by holding on lol
At least these one weren‚Äôt drowned.
And French plastic at that, so it should have surrendered quickly and easily
They‚Äôve been redirecting aid $ for decades but ‚Äòthe international community‚Äô keeps dumping $ into the shithole.  Hamas uses the $ that‚Äôs supposed to be going to help the people (who for whatever reason have never left) to buy weapons.  It‚Äôs sad how disconnected and myopic the posts are recently.  I guess this is the result of watching the news on one channel for years.  It‚Äôs really another form of brainwashing and the undereducated simps can‚Äôt see the forest because the trees are blocking their view.
Islamic fanatics/extremists, not Muslims.
Well, we could be double pedantic... it wasn't a game of  "English rugby league" it was a game of "British Rugby League". And it so happens to have just one non-British team in this particular division. This one. Catalan. The second tier also has one non-British team in it. Toulouse.(The French top league is the Elite 1)

&gt;The Islamic faith started itAnd who started it when it was just Phonecians and Amenities and Israelites and Samaritans?  Everyone has some more recent grievances, but they all just build on the old ones.
Go to the New York Post website. The baby pics are there. I looked and wish I hadn't.This is not going to end well for Gaza. Maybe the enabler nations of Hamas can work on a rescue mission of the Palestinians who dont wish to be a part of this. But not gonna happen.
&gt; Nobody really understands how it started.We do actually.  The Islamic faith started it about 632 CE when the Quran was completed.  Ayah al Baqarah 2:88 "And they say: Our hearts are covered. Nay, Allah has cursed them on account of their unbelief; so little it is that they believe."2:98 "Whoever is the enemy of Allah and His angels and His apostles and Jibreel and Meekaeel, so surely Allah is the enemy of the unbelievers."Surah An-Nisa 4:46 "[4.46] Of those who are Jews (there are those who) alter words from their places and say: We have heard and we disobey and: Hear, may you not be made to hear! and: Raina, distorting (the word) with their tongues and taunting about religion; and if they had said (instead): We have heard and we obey, and hearken, and unzurna it would have been better for them and more upright; but Allah has cursed them on account of their unbelief, so they do not believe but a little."It goes on, and on, and on, and on.  The religion of Islam, in its own words, teaches them that everyone that does not follow Islam is cursed, is an enemy, and should be converted by force or killed.
When I was about 10 years old, I was playing on the street when I passed by a large dumpster. I heard cries coming from inside, but I was too small to reach in and see what it was.So I went to my neighbor's house and asked for help. We dug together through the trash and found a plastic bag with something moving inside. We opened the bag and found three beautiful newborn puppies. We were both shocked. They still had their umbilical cords attached.I took them home and cared for them, but unfortunately they passed away shortly after because they had not been eating or drinking for a long time. I tried to call animal care from nearby cities because my village did not have such services available, but it was too late.We never found out who did it, and I'm still shocked that people capable of doing such things exist.
Hamas knew what was happening, why they don't evacuate the civilian sites?    Israel has also ordered all civilians to leave the area and Israel has set up green zones and warned people with text messages.    What has Hamas done to protect civilians?    All deaths are currently attributed to Hamas. And the leaders of hamas are currently eating the finest food in their 10 star villas in Qatar.    Why is Hamas not removed by the population?    Hamas currently bears sole responsibility for the war on terror. Israel doesn't have a clean slate, but what did Hamas expect in response to the massacre?    The people of Gaza should think about why their president lives in luxury in Qatar and them have to pay for what Hamas has decided.
And somehow people are mad at Israel for not supplying water and power to the very people that stole and repurposed this foreign aid to build the weaponry that was used to intentionally kill and capture Israeli civilians. Why doesn‚Äôt Gaza have reliable water and power of their own with as much aid as they‚Äôve gotten the past couple of decades? Makes you think‚Ä¶Presumably if utilities were restored in Gaza tomorrow, it would be used to spin up their lathes to make even more missiles (all of the infrastructure is set up by Hamas for their fighting capacity, not so much their civilians it turns out‚Ä¶)
This is a long game, world leaders in the Arabic world tend to be dictators that stay in office for life, or till the next coup. The hope is overtime support for Israel slowly erodes as they commit more and more war crimes that make it hard for the West to ignore. Western politicians tend to be short term thinkers because their terms are limited, it only takes one US president to pull support for Israel and change the game up, so they get a chance every 4 - 8 years, you also got to think about radicals in congress that may start listening to voters that sympathize for the Palestinians and throw monkey wrenches in budgets that aid Israel. A weaker Israel, no matter how much, is good news for countries like Egypt, Iran, Jordan, Lebanon and Syria.Edit: You should also consider the drag this war will have on Israel‚Äôs economy. War aint cheap, and its gonna take a lot of money to keep almost 400,000 troops in the game, as well as the loss you get from not having those people doing their normal jobs.
Oh yeah , tonight I have some murderous intentions...You have to be the most bottom of the barrel, the absolute lowest of the low to do this....ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC!!!People who do this need to be on a list...
Starship Troopers.
Israel is causing mass genocide! How we as American stand by this and yet defend Ukraine from Putin! This is hypocritical to say the least! Stop funding and giving them ammunition!
If we're being pedantic it was in France.
Yeah I know, but guilty until proven...not guilty.
I don‚Äôt think all humans are capable of this
Time Enough for Love?
Precision....FYI, HAMAS uses hospitals, schools &amp; other peoples lives recklessly. Isreal has sent audio broadcasts to people's phones. It tells them where to go to avoid strikes. Can't say that about the cowards.
How do they leave an open air prison? You can‚Äôt leave Gaza.. educate yourself with something other than the propaganda feed to you
I think I‚Äôve said this many times. Some people are assholes
So glad that these men noticed it
I didn't leave out the two women. Serviceman is a catchall term, and I will continue to call them serviceman. And you just prove my point, George W. Bush got people killed, politicians are your enemy stop sucking their dicks.
I have a question, how will the military support that the west will send to Isreal will be any good to Hamas? It'll only make things worse for them
That one tom and jerry episodes hits when I see shit like this...
The money was a ransom where  the US gave prisoners plus 6B to Iran and Iran released 5 American prisoners. Qatar has the money for Iran to use. We the US have released the money and no longer have it .
Where are all the children who were taken also? There‚Äôs no news on any of the kidnapped except Shani Louk.
I will never understand this. Ever. Thank god those men saved them! You could hear the upset in their voices. Merde indeed.
I truly hate humans.
As far as hamas and israeli leadership are concerned the only way this decades long conflict would end is with the genocide of the palestinians, which is unlikely to happen, the Israeli PM has said so publicly.Unfortunately this was a publicity stunt, Hamas leaders don‚Äôt live in Gaza, and the countries that support Hamas may hate Israel but don‚Äôt care all to much for Gaza. They wanted to provoke anger from the Israeli population that leads to the deaths of many Gaza civilians, which they know western society does not like. The hope is to create sympathy among western society and make western leaders second guess how much military aid they give Israel. This is why western leaders were falling head over heels to show support for Israel even before the details of the attack were even known, the west does not want to give up its military stronghold in the middle east.This is a game of chess, and sadly civilians are just pawns.
How many women and children were in that apartment building?
Surely it‚Äôd be Bradford Bulls, no?
Hey look. The braindead terrorist supporters are here.

There was no end game for the attackers, it was a suicide mission, kill and kidnap as many as possible before IDF kills you.As far as hamas and israeli leadership are concerned the only way this decades long conflict would end is with the genocide of the palestinians, which is unlikely to happen.Unfortunately this was a publicity stunt, Hamas leaders don‚Äôt live in Gaza, and the countries that support Hamas may hate Israel but don‚Äôt care all to much for Gaza.

What the fuck is the matter with people?  I hope whoever put those kittens in the trash is caught a suffers the same thing as punishment.  Kudos to the trash collectors for rescuing them.
Isreal did bomb something residence with citizen in Gaza man, sure they can bomb residence with Hamas army in it but now they targeting them and resident with Palestinians.I personally think they should evacuate all Palestinians and Israelians and let whoever wants war fight. That's the most humane thing they can do
Thank you, I follow this sub to be more aware of the real bullshit that goes on around the world but yeah Recently the back and forth, whos worse, who deserves it, bah. Enough, both sides are so so fucked.I saw a comment yesterday of someone saying It's possible to support Palestinians, denounce Hamas and their actions and recognize Israel's right to exist at the same time.I agree, it is possible.
You try cutting open a plastic bag full of tiny kittens without accidentally slashing them or upsetting them.

Lol good question. I guess they should tell us what GPT stands for more blatantly in the face
True
Hamas won't negotiate.  End of story.  Blaming Israel is like blaming the one person who would tell you to grow up and quit telling lies.
Sax
I was just about to say that lmao ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_up)
This comparison is kinda weird since it goes the other way around, when Israel attacked Palestinians before the Hamas terrorism even started, they should have killed all the Israelians?No. You're saying that they should kill Hamas AND the people there that have nothing to do with this, which it'll only make things worse
Israel does not bomb innocent people.  Hamas puts other Palestinians in the way to use them for propaganda.  That's why Hamas will fire rockets from schools and residences, to provoke a counter attack.
But they are there now. Aside from them leaving, what is the solution? If Hamas cared for their people, would any of this have happened??They KNOW that Israel would retaliate. They didn't do their people any favors. The United States went to war over 9/11.  The result was predictable.
Crazy how people only want to go back 80 years, and ignore hundreds of years of Muslim barbarism and thousands of years of Jewish claim.
Yakkity
International aid purchased those pipes, and they dig them up for ammo.  They use the sacks from donated rice bags to make sand bags for bunkers. etc etc
This is unlikely related to the current conflict.  Palestinians are known for using any old video for disinformation.
Why is it 'some people' attribute all reactions to racism.  Here is a list of things motivating negative comments that are not racism: impulsivity, paranoia, bad judgment, aggression, lack of functioning, confusion, hatred, maybe a person looking for any reason to be violent.  In the positive it could be the person is inquisitive, asking good questions, stating facts, making observations, looking for common ground, reinforcing healthy boundaries, and maybe has a 135 IQ and can connect the dots logically.

Awesome rescue
If they want a wider conflict with all their Arab neighbours I guess.  This would be an incredibly stupid thing to do
"I see field. I must RUN!"-The cow probably.
Thats the thing they are not civilian targets.  They are Hamas leadership, ammo storage, and rocket launch sites.  Hamas is the one that puts people in those so gullible people like you will see very minor collateral damage and think it comes close to the direct massacre of civilians that Hamas does.

&gt;x.com/visegr...Could not have said it better. Virtually every nation in the world has been created through violence and displacement of other peoples.  This is no different except the Palestinians keep rejecting any peace terms and want to fight instead of trying to find an agreeable solution.
The agents have entered
The babies, yes false. Some might have been, and there where dead babies, but not 40 beheadingsRapes, well no. No evidence only some reports from the people them selves. Correct, not 250 dead at the concert - reports said it was upwards of 500

üòÇ only joking it‚Äôs definitely weird
Why fire at civilian targets at all? Both sides definitely suck. Most people are out there just trying to get by. FUCK WAR and FUCK RELIGION
Because they aren't soccer players. This was a game of English rugby league aka the NFL without pads or helmets aka ice hockey on grass
Don't believe Hamas.  If you modelled Palestine after Israel, you would be successful.  But no, you elected Hamas.  Ain't that a shame.
i think its sad that innocent children get killed. But i can see the difference where hamas intentionally hunts civilian and kills babies intentionally ... and where Israel just does not give a dam about civilian causulties anymore when hamas also uses them as human shield. Both are bad .. but one thing is morraly a million times worse ... I find it disturbing how people on reddit and other places go around and support what hamas did .. but then cry about israel...    its very sad innocent and especially children die , and i wish israel would care more and would follow more international laws especially when it comes to the blockade where they stop food and even water. But i am not blind to the fact that hamas did not have some random civilian causulties in the attack of israel but directly targeted civilians.. babies , children .. raped them.. behaded them .. burned them .. killed them .. tortured them and did everything evil they can ...  its so much more evil then people being random causulties of bombing ...  Honestly bs from the OP and the post comment i read make me sick reading the hypocritics i see.
Israel has fired on over 1200 targets.  Less than 1000 Palestinians have died from those attacks.  It really seems like Israel is trying to miss people but hit buildings.  Hamas is to blame for telling people to stay in buildings Israel warned them to exit.

Palestinians fought the Jews for the land and lost. Then lost more after each revolt. If you win the land with a war, you didn't steal it you earned it. Palestine has never been a state, it has always been owned by other countries. I've spent hours studying the topic. You lost whether it be fair or not you lost. Now stop being whiny little bitches and f off.
Israel fired the fucking rockets indiscriminately.
Catalan Dragons Rugby League team. This was during the warm up.
Mongo only pawn... in game of life.
If Palestine is a country, whatis the main government over the country?  What money do they use?  Why are they depending on Israel for power, food and fuel.  Usually a country can take care of themselves and not have to depend on their enemy to live.   Maybe if Palestine used the money and resources to build an infrastructure instead of weapons things would be different.  Since 1942, Palestine hasn‚Äôt changed, so are those people just dumb or are they being brainwashed to live like they do
Religion is not related to this , there's always war and terrorism all around the globe no matter what religion they follow. There's always good and bad people just because they're muslims doesn't make all muslims terrorists, you're just spreading hate now
Are you talking about the illegal occupation of Israel by Palestinians and Ottomans before that since the Cascades captured the area 1000 years ago?  Did you mean that after reading your book?

Yeah it‚Äôs sad they have to pay the price, but as a leader of your people don‚Äôt you have a responsibility to ensure their safety? The leaders of Hamas surely knows by now that Israel doesn‚Äôt sit around and fuck spiders what did they expect? Kidnap, torture, rape families you‚Äôre going to put your people in danger one way or another.
Every soccer play should include a bull like this, It would be more fun
War won't stop what Hamas did was unprecedented. They expect warning signals when Israel sends bombs but they gave no warning of their brutal evil attacks. This is what their religion stands for brutality and hatred. It won't be over until it is reduced to Rubble

This idiot hops on Reddit just to call people racist for not agreeing with him ‚Äúread your history ‚Äú like stfu bro no one give a fuck babies are going to die in both sides and both sides are doing horrendous things if you would take that hamas Cock out of your mouth you might be able to see that
Israel was a tribal confederation in 1280 BCE- the rest of the ages up too 1942. What came first 1208 BCE or 1942?
Watch what please explain if you have an explanation
So you understand why they did it. Wow that‚Äôs just sad that you approve of the raping of women. Says alot about you. It‚Äôs okay tho the Gaza Strip will be free of terrorist scum soon
Are you stupid?? Read your history! There was no Israel before 1942. Typical Zionist claiming everything for their own. Even massacres, this shit is wild. You people are hopeless. It‚Äôs useless to interact with people with your mindset. Full of hate and ignorance. Wow.
    Muslim is as Muslim does.
You want to see beheaded babies and roasted families. Children with there heads cut off. Your calling everybody else ignorant, but you are the only one whom is. Palestinians are terrorists. The Jews are gods, chosen people, and you were attacking them because of their beliefs. As you said another, stealing food, music of indigenous people is not a reason to cut babies heads off and burn families alive. You are agreeing with the acts of terrorists.
So you are shocked and surprised at Isreal's reaction? What should they do in response?  What is Hamas' plan for peaceful coexistence?
Get fucked biggot I'm pretty sure if tpu go back far enough the Jews were the Irealites who where pushed out by the Muslims. If Hamas didn't attack Ireals then Isreal would bomb Gaza. Not to mention the Irrealis tried to give Gaza back to Egypt in 1979 but Egypt didn't want it. Hamas cannot defeat Isreal all they are doing is poking a bear then complaining when they get bit. If Hamas stopped fighting there would be no war.
And let‚Äôs watch what happens next after that, lol
I don‚Äôt approve it, I understand what provoked them to do it. Can you??
Sorry now you get to watch Gaza get blown to hell and back. Someone is triggered lol
What wrong doing? I‚Äôm acknowledging the reason for it, it wasn‚Äôt unprovoked. If your kid beats up the bully at school, would you blame him? I would find out the reason why he is attacking the bully in the first place. So you won‚Äôt even acknowledge the thousands of innocent children and people dying form the air strikes to a city which no one could escape??
So do you approve of what Hamas did to the isrealies
You're one to talk. Won't even Acknowledge hamas wrong doing.
I am a Semite, you don‚Äôt even know your history. Go read a book and learn you ignorant dumb POS.
No, I‚Äôm not. I‚Äôm trying to spread the truth. Which unfortunately no of you want to know or willingly turning a blind eye to genocide. Ignorance is bliss.
Just another antisemite Palestinians kill 1000 Irealis and when they get attacked back they pretent to be victims. The ones actually responsible for the terrible things that baby experienced is Hamas. Get fucked tou bigot piece of shit.
No, I am telling you what provoked Hamas to do such things, and as long as Israel continues this, Hamas won‚Äôt be the only thing they should worry about. A bully can‚Äôt continue to bully without the victim having enough and stands up to their bully.

No it‚Äôs not, they‚Äôre speaking Arabic you ignorant lying SOB. After Israel stays stealing the land, the food and music of the indigenous Palestinian people, they even want to steal and claim the victims of the massacre which they are doing. You can‚Äôt make this shit up.
Are you condoning the killing of innocent people? If so, then you are no better than Israel. I can see you are already stuck in what you believe in.
This is Hamas. Free Israel
Sorry, what did you expect from a group of people that have been stuck in a open air cage for more than 15 years under Israeli blockade and occupation?? The actions of Hamas wasn‚Äôt unprovoked. Read you history first.
Sorry but what did hamas expect would happen when they go killing people? Blame hamas no Isreal for this.
Lol! What!? You clearly don‚Äôt know your history. No use to argue with the ignorant. Go read a book first then comment on my post. This has been going on for the past 80 years, there was no Israel before 1942.
What about her boyfriend?
Yeah thats how war works, it sucks
yea it sucks for both sides, but i believe everyone was being getting along until Hamas started this shit storm a few days ago.
You‚Äôre ignorant and / or just full of hate and racist, so typical.
Hamas will go eventually, it's just about time but the innocents of Palestine will pay the price
that's a lot of hours. where's the link?
NO, The illegal occupation of Israel has brought the ethnic cleansing and genocide to the indigenous people of Palestinian for the past 80 years. Go read a book and learn your history before speaking.
Yes, endless fighting and shooting rockets to Isreal is far more important than this baby or feeding the people of Gaza. This is all part of the entirely predictable outcome of Hamas' glorious victory.
Both sides fucking suck. Fuck Israel and fuck Hamas. Fuck anyone who infringes on anyone who just wants to live their normal life.
Show me then, just more lies!
Hamas bought this on the people of Gaza.

I guess lmao, i watched the 5 second vid like 8 times lol
No before the zionist group got there the palestines and the Jewish people that were living there were peaceful towards each other they even welcomed the European jews. And as I said the zionist believed they had the right to take the entire land from the palestine people because of what there book said.
Are you blind?
what?&gt;
All I'm saying is don't be bias do your own research don't go of on anything the media tells you and look at the big picture. Media is always going to be bias and never going to show you the entire thing.
Yes, that‚Äôs correct. Justified because they were an Axis ally, and also because the land was stolen from the Jews .
The whole baby beheading situation seems like propaganda to me.
No britin had a small piece of land they gave it to the jews that came from Europe and they were zionist and they believed they had right to all of palestine so they took it by force. Look it up if you don't believe me.
I know this is a gross simplification, but it‚Äôs true
They lost that land because they were allied with the Nazis in WWII. They lost. So they get fucked.
Yeah not to mention the bots that either spam Videos about Israeli people getting slaughtered and downvote anyone into oblivion if they say anything bad against Israel
And what would you do if someone randomly showed up and said I'm taking your shit becuse my religion said it's my right now you can go or I can kill you and your family. Witch by the way a lot refuse to leave there home for obvious reasons and were killed for it. And if that wasn't enough took the majority of there land and pushed them to a very small are conperd to what they had. Stripped them of there basic human rights. And built a fence around them put tanks and towers around them dont have a right to grow there food so a lot of people go hungry or cant have wells for water the isreal government will fill them with cement. Isreal has complete control of what go's in and out have contro to food,water and electricity and they shut the water off 4 days out of the week. Does that sound like a way to live don't try to make isreal look like saints because they aren't. I'm not saying what hamas did wasn't terrible it was and they should be held accountable but so should isreal what about all the missiles they have launched with out provocation? I am not bias I looked at the whole picture and and only one side is being blamed when Isreal is also part of the problem.
Years ago Israel turned over Gaza and the West bank to independence  ( as in "you can elect your own leaders, self determination, congrats.... now go forward")   This was met with the election OF Hamas, and when you see a Residential building collapse and a bunch of secondary explosions, know that it was NOT just a "residential building" (or school or mosque), it was in fact their newly elected Hamas Government serving their citizens in Gaza as they wished to be;  with depravity and hatred for their neighbors.    No, I think a thorough house-cleaning is in order here.  They took all those kids (and killed babies and their civilian non-combatant parents in their own homes).  You do not reward that sort of depravity by granting them MORE land and self-determination - as they have abused it.  Encouraged it.  Funded it and endorsed it.   They have been breeding an army of terrorists for a long time and now it has become a bug-hunt.  So no, I think the time for response bombing is here, and should continue until they cough up all those people them took.   Every single one.   Until then, you are reaping the whirlwind Hamas, Iran, Hesbollah, Islamic Jihad etc. etc. etc.   Just like after 1972 Munich and 9/11 ..... there is a hard COST to these decisions and depraved actions.
Thank you
You have family history there you are all set get involved If they need foreign troops like they did in Ukraine I'm gonna go I'm one of those adrenaline rush guys would be good to get back in the shit
Na, I probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to, but when my family members went they just did basic stuff on base‚Ä¶serve food, clean up, just menial tasks, they didn‚Äôt have any training either.
Yea! Hamas is just a good bunch of guys trying to save lives!
You might not like Israel‚Äôs politics, but there is a difference in that and a terrorist organization.
Well, pretty much every man who has tortured babies and family's should be grinded into chum and fed to sharks.
I've seen this video before, except before it was Russia that used phosphorus munitions on Ukraine.
Are you fucking serious. These scum have been lobbing rockets at Israel on the daily for decades on end. This isn‚Äôt a response to a single attack but decades of relentless genocide of Jews. The Palestinians lost their right to the land in WW2. They have had 80yrs to get over it and build a life elsewhere. Instead they stay and commit atrocities. Open you eyes, it‚Äôs clear who is righteous in this situation.
Nothing can stop this war now, Hamas has to go
they tried that 5 times already
I would also like to add that the comments on those kinds of posts are a moderation nightmare
I'm Tunisian, my best friend grew up in Palestine. Her entire existance has been horror after horror, until she came to Tunisia in her twenties. Not sure what's your point. A lot of reddit thinks this situation emerged last week.
What hamas did was absolutely wrong. Israel needs to defend itself. I pray they do not take it overboard and destroy an entire nation of people and innocent civilians. Israel needs to make some concessions and give the Palestinians control of their land, and stop allowing settlements. A change of power on both sides is the only thing to stop the war right now but that will not happen: the war is inevitable. More people that just want to live their lives and love their family will continue to die. It‚Äôs tragic.
I don't think that Isreal would give up some of its land to Palestinians even without this war
‚ÄúNazis‚Ä¶, I hate these guys‚Äù
I've been down voted into oblivion because I said Israel isn't the world's golden child
I would be celebrating too if my countries defense system was working and preventing my country from being bombed and the prevention of many more people being killed.. I‚Äôm not sure if this is supposed to come across as in poor taste of the Israel soldiers but if so, cheering that the missiles headed towards your country are being blocked is completely warranted. Nothing wrong with it..
you are 100% correct but unfortunately, I've seen a lot of people making good points being downvoted because they chose one side or another...but then very few actually engage in meaningful conversation...
We just gonna ignore what isreal has been doing for the last 75yrs to the palestine people?. I see the only lives that matter are isrealis lives. My other question where was the world for the last 75yrs while the palestine people were suffering no one said anything but when they finally retaliated were quick to talk. What hamas did yes was disgusting and should be held accountable but so should isreal for all they're atrocious acts for the last 75yrs don't be bias and a hypocrite.
Well you see a bunch of Arabs decided to build a mosque on top of the Jewish Temple Mount. Probably the biggest FU in history.
I'm sure Putin, Erdogan, MBS, Humanie etc will figure somethimg out üëç
I‚Äôm not trying to sound like a dick but that shows exactly how uninformed you are.  No one can just get up and leave Gaza.  This is exactly why there is conflict.  And a lot of innocent civilians are dying.  Because they have nowhere to go
Glitch in the matrix
Israel needs to give the Palestinian‚Äôs a piece of land with nation status
You don‚Äôt need a vpn, I haven‚Äôt even bothered to watch the Israeli Palestine videos. The Ukraine pages have scarred me enough.
Umm, like the Isreal families laying in their beds, only to have men storm in and murder whole families and babies too, deliberately aiming for BABIES? Oh, and with absolutely NO warnings,  not even 1 minute! You don't start a war and blame the demise of the innocent on the opposition!!! HAMAS did this, and they were NOT alone!!! Every innocent souls blood is on their hands!!! You cannot poke a sleeping bear and then blame the bear wheen it's eats everyone!!! Praying for you, that you find Jesus quick! The next second could be too late. You literally could be minutes from spending all eternity in a lake of fire.
r/ohwaitthatsubalreadyexistsitscalledNoahGetTheBoatwejustneedmodstonotmoditthewaytheyarenow
You're right that's a good point. I was looking at it pretty simplistically. The Israeli government claims it was turned  ‚Äúinto a training camp for weapons development and military intelligence.‚ÄùThey could be right or they could be full of shit. We'll never really know. I think days of looking at images of scattered bodies of the victims of Hamas have really flicked my brain into an emotional and non-rational state.The truth of the matter is that Israel will respond the the carnage on their people with carnage on the people of Gaza and at the end of this ordeal we will be left without any clear "Good Guys" like in the movies. Gaza will a pile of rubble and the cycle will continue till the end of time.
You went into their country, full-on attack mode, at night, with nothing more than murder, torture, rape, molestation, and beheading people on your minds. NO NOTIFICATIONS, NO ADVANCE WARNINGS! You murdered women, children,  babies, teenagers, and men. What exactly did you expect the response to be? You are being led by "the father of lies."  Tell the truth! They were dancing because they had a reason to celebrate. It's not too late. Turn to Jesus. The next second could be too late. Then it's the lake of fire, forever and ever. God bless, in Jesus's name.
These freaks were conceived by the way. They have families. And homes.
But who owns telegram and do you need a vpn to even open it ? Oh never mind I‚Äôve seen enough. Taking a break. It‚Äôs been a gnarly year.
what the hell man
Yea I usually think it‚Äôs my responsibility to bear witness since I already saw much in real world. But I am not looking at no babies stuff. Fthat
It was an accident. I didn‚Äôt mean to. I copied it from my Instagram story. Sorry
The psyop?  Please explain.  I thought a psyop was the integrated employment of the core capabilities of electronic warfare, computer network operations, psychological operations, military deception, and operations security, in concert with specified supporting and related capabilities, to influence, disrupt, corrupt or usurp adversarial human and automated decision making while protecting our own?
People are always in school whether setting stuff up or running things, for example in times of emergency or natural disaster schools and large buildings will be used to gather people and distribute food and supplies and also get people together to meet the needs of the community, those people are probably all dead now, men women and children. All dead.
Love being called an anti-Semite when I criticize Israel. Apparently the Star of David on my neck doesn‚Äôt negate that üòÇ
I only hate you for posting in ALL CAPS, tbh
Mobs I have posted some and I am sorry. Will not do again. /u/mrman08 While it is very disappointing to me to hear you take that approach I can understand.
Thank you! I hate war
Iran, Lebenon, Pakistan, Afghanistan anywhere really oh Russia Chechnya etc
I saw a similar aircraft titled 'Polish Air Force' landing in Israel on flight radar earlier too.
Run to where?  Gaza is a prison
This kind of thinking is what is needed.
PEOPLE OFTEN THINK OF JEWS SUCH AS MYSELF AS ZIONISTS BUT NOT ALL JEWS BELIEVE IN WHAT ISRAEL IS DOING. IN FACT, I DON‚ÄôT SUPPORT IT. WHAT NETIMYAHU IS  DOING TO PALESTINES üáµüá∏ ISN‚ÄôT RIGHT. BOMBING HOMES ISN‚ÄôT RIGHT. KILLING ISN‚ÄôT RIGHT.YES, HAMAS HAS TO LEAVE BUT WHY CAN‚ÄôT WE NEGOTIATE? I KNOW I‚ÄôM PROBABLY GOING TO GET A LOT OF HATE FOR THIS.
Good call.
I'm not trying to defend this but do you seriously think people are in class right now?
Fake video.
it's 25 miles buds lol wow relax in sure they have nothing basically a bully
Question.With news about hits from Israel to neighboring countries (syria, lebanon, Egypt, probably jordan soon too)We allowed to share stuff from there or they like count as israel stuff and fall under same ban.Just asking, for me not a friend.
Pulling in the gangplank now whilst all the propagandists are all safely onboard
Now that the lies of Israel are coming out ‚Äúwe will be enforcing a temporary ban‚Äù.
Can you give me a link? Source anything?
&gt; Go find a name of a kingdom that isn't Isreal that's ever been there, a collection of people that have been there that weren't jewish.Easy. Here is a map of the historical region, at the peak of the kingdom of [Israel](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bd/Kingdoms_of_Israel_and_Judah_map_830.svg/800px-Kingdoms_of_Israel_and_Judah_map_830.svg.png). There is debate on whether both kingdoms of Judah and Israel ever unified, but even here you can see that the palestinian where still present. Can you name any of my inaccuracies by the way?
i would think you would have to have prior military or at least prior peace corp experience do you have a dd214 or anything similar or any specialized training that would prepare you for a potentially high risk situation?
Good question.  Especially since most have basic training and must serve to remain a citizen which I agree with. Each home should be allowed to defend their country and family. That was my first question also, why no 2nd amendment to at least have a fighting chance or to take a few terrorists out before overrun. I wish our own country had some form of mandatory service for citizenship, even in a guard or support role.  - But to be trained and not have the tools to protect your family.  Ouch
I didn‚Äôt say Hamas I said Palestinians. Don‚Äôt mince my words
So your calling for genocide too ?Its hard to tell from your short response.

Hmmmmmm.hmmmmmmm,hmmmmmmmm
Well [Hamas' stated end](https://embassies.gov.il/holysee/AboutIsrael/the-middle-east/Pages/The%20Hamas-Covenant.aspx) goal is the destruction of Israel.. So I can only think of two ways this will end.. the destruction of Israel or Hamas. Unless somehow cooler heads prevail.. but looking at history that doesn't usually happen until the leadership of the current regime is dealt with.
[This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRYZjOuUnlU&amp;ab_channel=Vox) one explained it pretty good to me last night when I had this same question.
Seen what I needed to see.  Thanks
But we can post a video of Wagner soldiers cutting the nuts off a Ukrainian soldier...
Edit
Yes, there is but we all know that you will not do it.
Israel bombing students? And people will still defend lol what a joke
This should have been deaths to the Hamas and all terrorists they are just giving the Palestinians more propaganda.
Probably picking up people.
Trump being a dick.
Of course,  you left out the two women who died in that assault. The Department of Defense stated that they were "killed as the result of an enemy attack while supporting non-combatant evacuation operations."  Did you forget that George W. Bush got 4,492 servicemembers killed in the Iraq War on suspicion only of Weapons of Mass Destruction. They found no such evidence.We had no right to be there in the first place. But of course, they changed the resolution to say we were fighting to take out Saddam Hussain.  (I called him "So-damned Insane")
Dude this is simple, Islam is a religion of peace.
Is there any Argentinian victims or hostages?
As far as I can see, this continues on from various events that began in the Bronze Age.  Nobody really understands how it started.My only view is, everyone has already had a go at solving their problems with violence.  It hasn't worked before, and I don't think this time will be the charm.
Im American, and I work for a small company in the states. The owner is a woman who lives 30 minutes south of the village that got massacred.I still dont really care what happens. They have been, and will forever keep fighting.

You mean the 'schools' from where Palestinians fire rockets into Israel, to use the deaths and injuries from counter strikes as propaganda?
I‚Äôm having the hardest time finding any of them, that‚Äôs why I came here. I knew redit would know.
But where will they recruit more terrorists?
What do you mean "reclaim"?  Israel has been pretty laid back about the holy sites.
f
The IDF is texting instructions to the public in Gaza on how to evacuate from Gaza to the West Bank, Hamas has told them not to leave and are actively preventing them from leaving. There is recorded audio from last year when the IDF went to blow up that Hamas HQ in the apartment building. The IDF pleaded with them to get the families and children out of the building, the Hamas terrorist told him to blow it up, they won't be evacuated. He said that they will be matyrs, to reveal to the world how cruel Israel is.
You are misled, they were civilians, many teenagers and even young children as young as 7 were kidnapped. A captured Hamas soldier admitted that they are going to rape them. Hamas is posting videos of them killing children. Idk what more proof you require.
Nah probably just more innocent families needlessly being slaughtered
Isreal' was the Jews' territory long before Islam even existed.

Specifically on your third point, if you go to pinned posts, they have a post pinned about the Russian invasion of Ukraine. So to answer your question, yes they have done the same thing. I don't remember what they did when the invasion started, but maybe someone else can answer that.
This video really helped mehttps://youtu.be/ZXfuqUhzESg?feature=shared

Akbar!
Yes I certainly can because Hamas were only founded 1987. Dickhead propagandist
Impressive strike
Caliphate = an all Jewish state. Just shut the fuck up and go circle jerk over palenstinian deaths
I mean if you know the history between these two.... I tell ya what... that's one of my selling points if I'm a builder.    I say " I can build a building to withstand 2000lb bombs...  5000lb bombs.... but it's gonna cost you..."
I could only watch a bit of that. It was hard stuff. This endless cycle of violence is not going to end if they just keep repeating this. Putting 2.2 million people in a prison that's 25 miles long is going to breed extremism, especially if you keep bombing it every few years. Considering that 50% of Gaza is children, they have been imprisoned their whole lives just because they were born there. If this was any other group of people, it would be seen as a concentration camp.The thing is, two state solution is not a real solution because the Palestinians are I'm tiny pockets within Isreal proper, it would only continue the madness that currently exists.One state solution they won't want to do for the main reason it hasn't already happened... the Palestinans are nearly or will be very soon the majority population there. Because isreal is a democracy, they would lose their control over the land.Most surprising thing about the situation is that the west doesn't acknowledge the Palestinian Christians at all. I think that if they did, the narrative would shift pretty quickly because they are also quite fed up with the isreali government.
Hmmmm thousands of years and no lesson learnt!
Can you show me any evidence that babies were harmed? Also these "women" are IDF soldiers remember Israel has mandatory national service meaning they most likely participated in the massacre of Gazans. Please explain how you can conclude anything you just said??????
Apparently the rapes and beheading of children was just propaganda. There is no credible accounts so far. I just saw a video on insta of isrealis cutting of a Palestinians arms and driving over the dead body saying some crazy things in the background. You can still see the post on Shawn Kings insta.There was also another one of some kid that was set on fire by a bunch of settlers, someone saved him but it was chilling to see.Would not recommend seeing either of the videos.I think from hamas side I saw a video of them stomping on a dead soldier they pulled from a car.By far the most chilling thing I've ever seen was a father trying to protect his little kid while some sadistic idf soldier was gunning them down for no reason. This was a few years back. Some ambulence tried saving them and it got shot at too. That video is gut wrenching.Man there's so many, it's sad stuff though, lots of videos out there of some random students walking and getting shot for no reason. It's not hard to find them but because it's mainly Palestinians you won't find them on the news.
While I do agree with you. Knowing any hostile-acting religion can have their hands on weapons of mass destruction hits different than them having horses and swords.
Hamas brought what is happening now on its own people. Gaza's current situation is on them and you can't debate that.
holy crap this is probably the least if not non-biased take, on the history of Israel and Palestine. Thanks for sharing
Look at me, look at how much I'm a victim, that makes my opinion more valid. Stfu. And if you're a veteran, you should despise politicians because they are the ones who start all of the wars. Joe got 11 servicemen killed in Afghanistan.
He had a hard time even focusing on giving the speech, did you even watch it? And Joe is so dementia ridden he can't even answer questions himself. Joe himself doesn't do anything, and his administration is also to blame for the withdrawal of Afghanistan. Why are you a dick sucking a politician, who does dodgy business deals in Europe, and talks about racial jungles?
Bottom line here everyone is beheading babies, burning old ladies alive, torturing, raping, mutilating and being stupid enough to not see your now the pawn of Iran, China and Russia makes you less than human. A group of people who allow an evil like this to exist in their midst is just as guilty!!! The same for Germans in the 1930‚Äôs‚Ä¶.. or anywhere else in the world. We as societies have to police our own. ‚ÄúIt takes a village to raise a child!!‚Äù Is a true statement. The people of Gaza could have turned these murderous creatures I can‚Äôt call humans into the Egyptians or Isreali‚Äôs‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. Instead not a word was said and this latest attack is a perfect example of how the people in Gaza obviously are part of the problem. How else did this attack go completely undetected. No one way they people didn‚Äôt know this was being planned and was getting ready to kickoff. It takes a a helluva a lot of work to plan and deploy everything all at once like that. So no Not all of the  people in Gaza are really innocent‚Ä¶. I pray for all the truly innocent people all over the world who are under constant threat of evil acts by murderous non humans!!!! When will the people of the world rise up and decide it doesn‚Äôt matter what color , religion , amount of wealth whatever else that we covet just doesn‚Äôt really matter. What does matter is the basic rights of everyone to be safe and protected from evil. We must all decide to stop these non human devil possessed creatures all over the world!!!‚Äô
Everyone that watches this and still believes in there fake religions is brain dead
Dude we get it but there‚Äôs a reason people are going to warn you. Plenty of us (I grew up stupidly seeking out war footage) have experience with this shit and it always comes down to regret. It‚Äôs good to remind yourselves every blue moon but for fuck sake be mindful of your mental health because this shit isn‚Äôt good to dabble in
Thanks for this synopsis!
So how long are you theists going to make us people that don‚Äôt believe live like this?
Please don‚Äôt take part in either sides craziness let them take one another out
Israel bombing schools again, color me shocked

You can search up codes such as PLF for polish military aircraft and RCH for US military aircraft in filters-airlines on Flightradar24
There‚Äôs been a bunch of military aircraft flying in these past 2 days with US C-17 and a C-5 (supplies), Greece (staging area for reservists), poland, UK, and Spain.

Middle East is never ending wars and conflict. Plus it‚Äôs basically all muslim countries vs Israel being the one Jewish country
And we have Iran like what $6 billion? And where did that immediately go? Thanks Joe
An end game for hamas and palestine
I‚Äôm pretty sure Hamas takes volunteers, if you‚Äôre interested.

Technically they believe in the same God I think just different religions. I definitely could be wrong so don‚Äôt downvote me just reply if I am wrong
Not insured for that deposit!
Go ahead join in the massacre of 2 million Palestinians...that is your Holy Duty...certainly the past four days these animals have survived your bunker bombs and are still alive...these scumbags deserve total anhilation in the name of self defence because poor poor Netanyahu shut down the iron Dome...created his own 9/11...this way Isreal gets Gaza in the name of peace.... certainly IDF is going to play by International Rules just like they have been doing for the padt four days
Holy shit! Triggers! This same exact scenario in the same exact way it happened, happened to me when I was apprenticing in 2004 at 18 years old. Luckily enough was wearing a face shield bc I was about to prep 150 live lobster when our morning banquet chef had asked me to pull turkeys out. When the oil flew all over me, Blanca, our morning pervy banquet chef, literally stripped me but naked to prevent and scalding on my skin
It all started in 1913 in Russia when the Jews burnt the church down.

Hi, I was in the same boat a few days ago. Had a very basic understanding of the situation but wanted to know more from an unbiased source.

History and religion be damned my boy that shit ain‚Äôt logical plain and simple
Is there a place I can volunteer to help Palestinians evacuate from genocide? I have some 2 million fellow human beings who live there. Anyone have insight on that?
The people of this region all have a historical and religious claim that is much more powerful than your 300 year rule. Jerusalem is split into 4 religious quarters because of thousands of years of history that has occurred in this region, and this history is worth dying for to them. This has nothing to do with BLM, reparations or any other American problem.
Confirmed video was from from Central America in 2015.
Not going to argue with your inaccuracies.  Go find a name of a kingdom that isn't Isreal that's ever been there, a collection of people that have been there that weren't jewish.  Ask yourself...why does every map of 1920 of the region show almost no settlements or populations?  Why did the league of nation have to name the region and the people...a name the people now use today?  What was their original name after all?  What was their society called?  Who was their last leader?  Are you saying the people who had been there for thousands of years all adopted the random name picked from a history book about ROME by the league of nations?Once you start asking objective questions looking for concrete objective answers, your statement fall apart I'm afraid.I dont want to be rude, but actual history records debunk your claims.  Considering its a narrative the media has pushed for decades now, it's understandable enough.
It was on here earlier today and now it‚Äôs gone. It was just brutal.
1) uhm, because they're the mods of the sub2) well, they're the mods 3) There wasn't as much hate speech around that conflict. So, it makes sense the response would be different.4)Ah. Well, I was going to recommend that anyway lol. Start a new sub! One completely without the power-tripping moderation going on here. One where **only you** can decide what's going to be in the sub. Oh. Wait.&gt;Stop censoring real life.I don't know about you, but I'm getting **plenty** of Hamas-Israeli stuff flooding my feed. Personally I *wish* more subs would mod this shit and keep the subs on track. I realize everyone's all over this right now and eager to karma farm or give hot-takes but that *isn't this sub*. So I welcome the mods doing their job and keeping the sub on track.
This is a good start for the last three days ben Shapiro has had some very strong and moving videos. No one wants to watch these videos, but it is the face of evil. The little silver lining i got from these images and videos is that it makes me incredibly thankful to live in America. As big and as atrocious as our problems seem, at least we aren't being beheaded or sodomized to death. I am very fortunate.
Usacrime.com has some pretty barbaric and fucked up videos. Never seen that much blood before. Grown men sobbing holding their dead babies and children. Hamas mutilating dead Israeli soldiers by stomping, stabbing and shooting their dead bodies. It‚Äôs horrific but I‚Äôm Jewish and have seen a lot of holocaust videos and this is baaaad bad.
Yeah before the Ottoman Empire which was 600 years old. I‚Äôd say anything over 300 no one today is alive for it to matter. Like I‚Äôm all for Black Lives Matter too and I can agree slavery and racist laws set back the black community but I don‚Äôt think black folks need reparations just need investments back into all poor communities in America. Jim Crow laws ended 1965 and the effect on black Americans is way more recent.  But 600 years ago? Trippin absolutely, at that point fuck you and your claims that was just expansionism you lost get over it if you or any of your relevant family didn‚Äôt get kicked off it ain‚Äôt the same
Don‚Äôt stop now! Level another one!
You choose to ignore the fact that there was a time before the Ottoman Empire when Jews dominated the region. To what point in time do you roll the ownership of the land back? It would be great to share the land, but both sides have ruined this option. Neither side is innocent of imposing mental and physical harm to the other. Unfortunately, Gaza is currently run by a terrorist organization who gets no sympathy from me or much of the world. If you invade a music festival to kill civilians, then you are the bad guys.  If you video yourself breaking into homes and killing the occupants, then you are the bad guys. It‚Äôs pretty clear who is currently the biggest problem.
He needs to see it.
We survived the past several thousand years with religion. A time when people were less likely to be amicable, level headed and tolerant of others. In that time, many wars were fought and many more lives were lost. We survived then, we survive now, we will survive in the future
Imagine we just never took over and gave it to the German and Russian Jews ? Now we gotta wipe em out cuz they didn‚Äôt lay down and let a bunch of ppl who been in Europe for hundreds of years take over ?
This indded my friend is the problem.
Okay that‚Äôs prolly true how do you justify what isreal does ? You prolly don‚Äôt even know .
They got the best Air Force and intelligence in the region and they controlAnd surveil Gaza they new it was coming it‚Äôs gonna be they excuse and the US is gonna support it cuz evangelical Christian‚Äôs tryna fulfill a prophecyb
It never belonged to the German and Russian white Ashkanazis in control of isreal and Palestine now .
Yeah, every time this gets posted they act like it‚Äôs one, but the whole area has tons of them. And like no pictures or streetview lol
They not allowed to leave Gaza it‚Äôs the one of the mostly densely populated places on earth . They treat the Palestinians like the nazis treated them .
Palestine ? You mean Gaza . the west end is run by Tafa they did not elect Hammas. Even though the Oslo agreements says there should be a Palestinian state there never was and never will be .
So what should they do ? England took over Palestine and gave it to the Jews . I just don‚Äôt see how it‚Äôs okay to use white phosphorous like isreal does ‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs a fuckin war crime . Lyndon B Johnson and the prime minister admitted there was no imminent threat when isreal attacked Egypt in 1967 . ‚ÄúDefensive war‚Äù my ass . You prolly think Mossad didn‚Äôt see this coming with the best Air Force and intelligence in the area with surveillance of all of isreal Gaza and the west end. They knew the attack was coming now they gonna use it as an excuse for an actual genocide .
Well, I've seen multiple videos of the Israel/Palestine war and also Russo/Ukranian war. Middle eastern construction is not that good. Ukrainian buildings stay standing after getting hit by similar bombs, that's why you either see holes or the skeleton of the building still standing. Remember the Turkey/Syrian earthquake several months ago. These buildings just pancake.
It‚Äôs not whataboutism . The zionists are evil plain as day they don‚Äôt follow the Bible they follow the Talmud . They attacked Egypt first in 1967 they own prime minister and Lyndon B Johnson said there was no imminent threat . This whole conflict is cuz we kicked the Palestinians out for Jews and Germans .  The Oslo agreement was never upheld there is no Palestinian state .
My question is what is the end goal at this point? Is it fight to the extension of the other??
As a veteran of the Iraq war I still hear the term "hidden weapons of mass destruction" as a term of propaganda. The same could be said for these "atrocities".  I don't want to be fooled again.
Didn‚Äôt you see what Hamas just did???
Basically  hamas wants to kill jews because of years of brainwashing adue to the fact they were givin the state of isreal and they crossed a line they can't  go back by murdering  and doing inhumane  things to innocent  civilians so they will get leveled  and unfortunately  many more innocent  ppl on the other side may die and iran is just watching this with a smile as they build there bomb
There is a good video on YouTube about the formation of Israel and the  forced removal of the Arabs that‚Äôs lived there on that land . And there is a video about the rules and limitations that the people in Gaza have imposed on them .
No.  I am a disabled American female veteran who receives a monthly compensation check from the VA for losing my ability to have children after being gang-raped the night my company graduated from Basic Training back in 1979.What have you done to support our country?
I don‚Äôt agree politically with ben Shapiro normally but this video is intense and moving. I just wish for no violence at all but if there has to be some that both sides stop using civilians, especially children, as cannon fodder. It does nothing but fuel anger and creates extremists on both sides.
Doesn‚Äôt matter that you have more or that you have larger nukes. For us, we can use that as a fireproof home defense against the Great Shaytan and devote our resources to financing and sending volunteers to our Islamic brothers in the global jihad. It‚Äôs a great position to be in, actually.
We got bigger nukes, if you want to play whos cock is bigger I can guarantee you it‚Äôs the US.
Are zionists not terrorists for what they did during nakbah? Do you even know about it to begin with
Zionists did the same.
This really is probably the most moronic post I have seen.  To come in and get on your knees to gobble dementia Joes knob is quite PATHETIC!!!!!  Nancy is that you?
And isreal is a country born of terrorism and bloodshed. Read about nakbah and come back
So what do you call isreal lol if Hammas is terrortists for sure , so is Mossad . At least the Palestinian are fighting for there country. Isreal don‚Äôt allow them chocolate or even lentils they control the land air and sea around Gaza . The crazy thing is y‚Äôall prolly think they didn‚Äôt see this coming, they got the best Air Force and intelligence in the region. it‚Äôs just they excuse to bombs the women and children in Gaza . Like the ‚Äúdefensive war‚Äù in 1967 when they attacked Egypt . They own prime minister said they lied and knew Egypt wasn‚Äôt gonna attack . Lyndon B Johnson said the same , they investigated Israel‚Äôs claims and found no evidence Egypt would attack ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è whole conflict built on lies .
You can hate the Israeli government without hating Jewish people. You can hate Hamas without hating Palestinian people.
Hopefully religion will end religion
Lol, unbiased? The Palestinian arabs are the closest living descendents of the original palestinian people who held the region for millenia. Also the name Palestine  precedes the romans by a quite a bit. Herodotus an ancient greek historian/geographer named the region as  Palaist√≠nƒì from the 5th century BC, that is \~500 years before any roman influence on the region. Even the jewish texts have a name for the region as Pelesheth. Israeli attempts at downplaying palestinian history is literally just a justification for their colonial behaviour.You forgot to mention that in the precursor to the first Israeli-Arab war, 700,000 palestinians were displaced and expelled from their ancestral lands into arab lands by zionist militia which the arabs call nakba. The israelis did have some legitimate concerns initially since they thought the second holocaust was about to happen but what the war evolved into was just an expansionist state with their form of manifest destiny. Those children of Nakba are still stateless which is considered a human right violation.Also you talk about how much money the palestinian people recieve in aid. You forget to mention that Israel has enforced a blockade on them for years denying them access to amenities like water, electricity and food. Israel doesn't even allow desalination plants in occupied west bank where 97% of water in occupied territory is toxic. Talking of money, the US has given over $250bn for Israel and all of that money is for weapons and missile defence systems. Israel an OECD nation is considered one of the top reciepients for american aid.The funniest part is "Israel has been extremely forgiving". Due to the occupation and blockade, the median age in gaza is 18. 40% of them are 14 or younger. When Israel has started indiscriminately bombing buildings, they are killing kids. What a funny concept, a warning missile. I wonder how many people would hear a missile hit their property and then think, yes this is actually the warning missile. They are taking down civilian infrastructure like telecom companies and then claiming that they can phone people to warn them in advance.Just remember that for the last 5 decades, the UN has tried to pass resolutions critical of Israel over 53 times, and every single time gets vetoed by America who encourages Israel's actions. Ultimately its not good that civilians are getting killed, and I'm sure as this drags on, casualties will pile up on both sides. However the western media will never cover Israel's warcrimes and will just hyperfocus on Hamas and demonize palestinians.
Caused by 6.8 earthquake in 1815.Tried to find this in the comments, but failed, so...
The Palestinians have harboured terrorists like Hamas in Gaza for Decades. Its time to clean out the nest. At least Israel sent text messages to the civilians to leave, even after Hamas slaughtered Israelis.

Listen to 178. Israel At War by The Rest Is Politics on Audible. https://www.audible.co.uk/pd/B0CKRX6GN8?source_code=ASSOR150021921000VI think this podcast is pretty unbiased and sums up some of the reasons
It's very impressive how most of these missile strikes destroy the target building without really destroying anything else around it.
Not a doctor here, thats not supposed to happen
It amazes me how you can have all the information IN FRONT OF YOU, and you STILL can't see it...I clearly state that their caption is obviously wrong (do you see the words "obviously wrong" in parentheses?). And by it being wrong, they are suggesting a false version of the event. I'm stating the false meaning they're inadvertently suggesting by using incorrect wording in their caption. I'm lamenting that they made such an obvious mistake. Their caption says the plane is pictured seconds BEFORE colliding, while the picture clearly shows it seconds AFTER colliding (or rather the moment OF collision). By suggesting that what we're seeing in the picture is the B-17 seconds BEFORE it collided, it suggests (falsely) that the plane broke up in midair on its own, BEFORE the collision. I know they did not MEAN to suggest this, but by mistakenly using the word BEFORE instead of AFTER, they have misrepresented the event. Do you understand now? You're the only one not getting this. I got many upvotes. Everyone else understands.\*If we're going to belabor this further, I strongly suggest we spare these kind people our bickering back &amp; forth, and take this discussion to direct messages. Please engage with me there, if you must.&amp;#x200B;Thanks.\-ACSF
If you weren't so stupid (and you are in this case), you would know better!I just watched him give a press conference where he talked about how hard his administration is working to make sure that as many people on earth as possible can find peace. He didn't look too sleepy to me.The last thing he said was that he wouldn't be taking any questions himself,  but that his staff would answer as many questions as possible after he left.One person in the crowd responded.  At first, I thought it was another moron asking another stupid question.  But when we were finally able to hear him, he was thanking the president for his great leadership ability and for his love for humanity. The whole crowd erupted in applause.   I just cried. Pay more attention!

I don't really think it's possible to look at it unbiased, it really just depends on where you fall and what you think is right. If you don't think Israel should be allowed to exist, which you are allowed to believe, you might support the Palestinians, but if you believe the Jews deserve to live in their original lands, which you are also allowed to believe, then you would support Israel, and there's so many other factors like previous battles between them that factor as well.
You should be thanking the American taxpayers for buying the iron dome, not sleepy old Joe. Hes probably sleeping right now lol.
No, I didn‚Äôt. Read it again.
Seems that Israel has better Technic to take buildings down with rockets than Russia
Nah dude, you very clearly stated the article claimed the plane fell apart in mid air. It doesn‚Äôt.
Nah.  The farthest back this goes is the founding of islam.  Muhammed HATED jews, though not initially.  He had tried to establish his own religion in his hometown, they kicked him out (religions were a way of making money).  He goes to Medina I think it was, where he tried to convince the christians and jews THERE that he was a prophet on par with Jesus, they didn't like that and kicked him out, the jewish community was in particular hostile to the idea.  So while initially "people of the book" had a form of protection, he later rescinded that before he died and said if they don't submit and convert or pay tax, christians and jews were also to die.
Fuck your god if u do this
Ironically what I find so many people didn't know that when Israel fires a missile they fire a warning signal 3 to 10 minutes before they actually fire a missile into Palestine. But why does Hamas not give a warning sign to Israel? I did leave a comment but I feel that this war goes back to Abraham because Ishmael is the descendant of the Arab people and Isaac is the descendant of the Jewish people and they've been fighting this war since Abraham was alive all because Sarah could not get pregnant and therefore Abraham impregnated the Egyptian maid named Hagar, ironically then Sarah Abraham's wife gets pregnant and the two boys have fought for was fair between the two of them
&gt; It‚Äôs terrible what is happening but please do not use this tragic event (on both sides) to push agendas or as an excuse for hate speechIt‚Äôs truly sick the level of picking sides that is going on, I don‚Äôt see this in terms of sides, I see this as innocent human beings are suffering. Sadly in times like this the innocent suffer the most.Religion is truly the biggest monster.
https://www.instagram.com/reel/CyRaNJmolGf/?igshid=NjIwNzIyMDk2Mg==This is what isreal doing at gaza and they still doing it.
Basically, the British Empire.
I think you misread my comment. I wasn‚Äôt seriously supposing that the plane fell apart in midair by itself, and that the other plane crashed into the debris. I was saying that, because the caption is obviously WRONG (the picture quite obviously DOESN‚ÄôT show the B-17 seconds BEFORE colliding; It clearly shows it seconds AFTER. Or the moment OF impact), their wrong caption relays the events incorrectly, thus suggesting that it broke up on its own. They weren‚Äôt trying to assert that, but their careless mistake made it it seem so. Clearly, whoever wrote the caption accidentally wrote ‚Äúseconds BEFORE‚Äù, when they actually meant ‚Äúseconds AFTER‚Äù.
What you‚Äôre describing is comparatively a de-escalation.   I‚Äôm asking if the political will is there for the Jews to finally do what they‚Äôve wanted to for the past many centuries.  Not that you proposal is without merit.
I will answer your profoundly stupid question:Even if true (unlikley), the argument YOU MADE ME/TRICKED ME INTO COMMITTING ATROCITIES has never been a valid defense of anything
Trust me bro, I saw it on telegram. No wait I saw it on RT!
I think you may have misread the caption. It says it was ‚Äú*seen* before colliding‚Äù but no where in the article does it say anything about falling apart before the collision.https://preview.redd.it/onkplsnv4ntb1.jpeg?width=828&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c73e93b4db3b8f51da432fbb00a83dd8b254371dThe article specifies that it split in half on impact.
From the way I understand that this war goes back for many years into the Jesus days. In the Bible it states that Abraham had two sons Isaac and Ishmael and Ishmael he had had with the maid her name was Hagar the father of the Arab Nation and Isaac was the father of all the Jewish Nation home Abraham had with his wife Sarah , she could not conceive and then he wanted children ironically she became pregnant. So because Sarah Abraham's wife could not conceive the maid Hagar from egypt. Depending on who you ask the Jewish people or the Muslim people they were told different things to be totally unbiased. The Bible States that Isaac was to inherit the kingdom of Abraham because he was born to Sarah and Ishmael was told he will be the ruler of a great Nation the Bible says that the Jewish people are the chosen people and they shall in her inherit Jerusalem and then of course something similar was mentioned to the Arab descendants feel that they are entitled to the land of Israel that is the sacred land of the world in the center of the world. But basically it goes all the way back to Abraham and his two sons. The descendants of Abraham who are Ishmael and Isaac have been fighting since the beginning of time.
If Israel citizens were arms the outcome would of been different.case closed

Keep going drop some more until it's just a pile of rocks and dead shit . IDF is going to wipe em off the face of the earth and nobody is gonna do a fucken Thing about it
I think it is because Hamas sent a lot of people over the border to Israel and they murdered a bunch of people. Well Israel didn't think this was a good thing, so they declared war on Hamas for going into Israel and murdering hundreds of Israeli citizens. Hope that helps.
You aren't going to find many unbiased views, it's just that deeply tied, so you have to look at both and come up with the middle ground.  I'll try myself from readings I've gotten.  I make no claim as to the perfection of this small novel.By the end of the 19th century (1800s) the UK had a problem it didn't like: Jews were immigrating to the UK fairly heavily with 200k-250k at the turn of the century.By the 1920s jews had also been actively working to go back to isreal and began independently resettling their homeland.  As such, and because the UK had a growing jewish population, the League of Nations (predeccesor to the UN) gave the UK a mandate: resettle the jews in the holyland from across Europe."According to article 22 of the Covenant of the League, the basis for the establishment of the system of international mandates, the authority to define the terms of mandates and the supervision of their execution was entrusted to the Council of the League. On July 24, 1922, the council confirmed the Mandate for Palestine, which included the Balfour Declaration, and the British government was thereby committed to place the country under such political, administrative, and economic conditions as will secure the establishment of the Jewish National Home. "The issueL The uk was very antisemitic, and they placed as the administrator of this mandate an arab who was also fervently antisemitic, who along with working to "resettle jews" he ALSO called for something else: an immigration of arabs.Prior to 1922, there wasnt a very large arab population in palestine, it was mostly uninhabited with bedouin nomads/traders and...jews..in jerusalem.  That changed after 1922.  There was no such thing as a "palestinian" because it actually wasnt even a word.  The word comes from the roman  ‚ÄúSyria Palaestina‚Äù which simply referred to the southern region of syria.  IT was literally never used again until after world war 1 as the designation by the league for the territory.After 1922 hwoever, arabs began pouring into the region from all over, and besides settling the land, they held pogrom after pogrom of jews (a pogrom is a mass killing of jews)  There is a book called The Pogroms in Palestine‚Äù (1929).  The perspective of it I couldn't tell you.1937 I think is when the UK abandoned the project because it wasn't working.  The jews they were sending were being killed by the arabs that they also called to kill them (it wasnt national policy, again its what happens when you put a non-neutral party in charge of a project he hates)The resettlement wouldn't be brought up again until after the world war 2 when instead of a trickle of jews, it was a flood as they globally sought to escape the horrors of europe.  This time the UN as a whole was to administer the process.  What you wound up with is several different channels of dsicussion between what was the arabic version of the UN, the Arab League, the UN, and the leaders of the resettlment movement (whats generally called the xionist movement).  In the end, there was a promise of the establishment of 2 states: A palestinian state which had the majority of palestin, and the isreali state.  The nation known as Jordan was created as a result which holds the majority of "Palestine'The day the UN announced it was done and Isreal was it's own nation, literally the day, every nation (including Jordan) attacked isreal with the intent of destroying it.  Thus began the animosity between Isreal and the region as a whole regarding actual nation states.  That isreal not only defeated the league but took massive tracts of territory didn't help.You then have basicaly 50-60 years of on/off warfare as the remains of the arab league kept trying to kill isreal and it failed.  Finally,. tactics changed and instead of armies, it became insurgencies and the likes of hamas and hezbollah were born.Open the 21st century:  In 2000, literally every single day there would be a bombing or shootup of a cafe, bus, hospital, market, something, by anti-isreali terrorists operating out of the west bank and gaza.  By this point, Isreal had offered palestinians on (5?) seperate occasions peace deals that included up to 94% of the territory they asked for.  It was soundly rejected every time, with every deal being responded to with increased waves of attacks.Isreal, since no natiuon can be seen as weak and survive, would respond to every terrorist attack with an attack on supposed terrorist locations.  Locations almost always placed intentionally next to civilian targets. The vast majority (but not all) of the killings by isreal of palestinian civilians is because it was intentionally designed to be so by groups like hamas, for whom no sacrifice was too much, especially the sacrifice of people they didn't care for (the locals)Due to isreals inability to stop the attacks, they finally got desperate and in a last resort before outright anhialation: they built a wall to seperate the palestinians from the isrealis.  Gaza is called an open air prison, and for good reason to the isrealis: the most dangerous people to their society are imprisoned there: hamas along with 2 million supporters who have never appeared to actively seek peace, only elimination of isreal.  Thhe walls though were a double edged sword: It DID succeed in slowing attacks from the west bank and gaza because it's much easier to guard a wall than open fields and streets, but it created an isolated breeding ground of resentment (deserved or not) of/by the locals.Palestine as a whole has received insane amounts of foreign aid compared to the actual land space getting it.  There are many who argue that despite the wall, gaza could be one of the most richest and beautiful cities in Isreali territory with all the money that has been sent there.  Obviously, a significant portion was diverted to purchasing weapons.And that brings us to where we are now: 5 generations of conflict back and forth.  The arabs for some reason refuse to permit an isreali state at all despite the isrealis being the only ethnic group to ever have an actual nation in the region that wasn't a semi-global empire like the romans, the palestinians are descendents of 20th century immigrants who went there for land and to fight jews.Both sides have commited atrocities, and my personal opinion is that the isrealis have been incredibly forgiving in their responses.  That roof knocks and phone calls to vacate targeted buildings happen even TODAY supports this belief, while hamas' continued forcing of civilians back into builings they know are about to be blown up continues the trend of sacrificing lives for optics.I hope that helps, I tried to be neutral overall and provide a base history of events a lot of people don't know of.  Many peopel think this is a conflict going back hundreds of years, it isn't.  They think there is an ethnic group that isrealis forced out of palestine, there actually isn't, that claim cant be made until the 30s and 40s once the arab population had exploded well after the jews had begun resettling the region.For the current generation of combatants in the region, frankly there's no peaceful outcome anymore.  Peace has been tried by one side and not the other and I' mafraid the only answer now is one side will have to kill the other, despite the "UN" and its "lofty ideals".

War crimes.

The Ukraine WAR is not an equivalent. The deletion of isis beheading videos would be an equivalent.
Pretty much everything hamas has done since Saturday is a war crime. Beyond that their goal is to spread it while bragging. People like that don't need a platform.
Welcome to battle on the beach brought to you by the Israeli navy. It's a one sided war picture with excellent footage of hamas terrorist being sent into the hereafter to claim their 72 goats. Explosions so hot there isn't enough spf sunscreen to shield the hamas fools. Stay tuned for parts 2 thru 1000.
Beautiful shot . May you have many more .
How true . Looks like the whole complex is gone. Bomb making 101 , wife beating 101, pedophile 101, and goat humping 101 as well. Those are just the required classes. Wonder if class was in session or just hiding rockets and weapons in there. It would seem to be a legitimate target. They'd hide weapons in a mosque, why not a school.  Trying  to make it look bad to western audiences.  But after babies killed and beheaded most of us don't care . They just want the terrorists dead , not caring how it's done now.
Not unless the PLO change their stance.  The PLO had actually recently taken a stance of non-conflict finally, and as a result the isrealis put the contruction of THEIR wall on hold.  It's amazing how when you stop actively trying to kill your neighbor, your neighbor doesn't kill or wall you off.
You didn't answer my question... Egypt warned Isreal about the attack...why was the Iron Dome shut down and Hamas was given free entry...blood is on Netanyahu's hand of the Isrealis killed on Saturday

No territorial dispute calls for the butchering of babies, elderly people and the rape of women and girls. You're failing to conceptualize the mentality of Hamas fighters, they aren't revolting for their lack of liberal rights, they're ideologically genocidal, genocide is quite literally their moral obligation. They're barbarians.

&gt; And then what are the odds of getting in a plane crash by collision in 1 of only 5 planes. Those odds go up a lot based on proximity. As a private pilot, my probability of hitting the Texas Raider was 0% because I was never within 1,000 miles of it. That probability was much different for a plane that worked airshows with them.
How. Does. This. Happen??? Alllll the safety checks and air traffic control???
hope some hamassholes were in there
I couldn't even finish the article.its a blame Israel ,poor Palestinians piece. They shouldn't support the kidnapping rape and murder of men women and children. The woman they pulled out of the jeep in Gaza was literally bleeding from her ass.and people are cheering it on.they raise kids to hate and kill jew whatever happens the Palestinian people asked for.why isn't Egypt helping them??? Or other Arab nations ? Cus they want nothing to do with them.they getting what they asked for
Can someone do the math. If it's 1 and 11 million (per Google) chance of getting in a plane crash. What are the odds of getting in a plan crash by collision. And then what are the odds of getting in a plane crash by collision in 1 of only 5 planes. Unlucky.

Thank you for the reply.
you need to know the somewhat recent history of isreal: they were having daily bombing and gun attacks in cafes and busses and every random mudnane place you can think of back in the early 2000's.  This is the ultimate reason gaza got a wall put up around it: Not because jews hate palestinis, but because they were desperate to stop the terrorists coming out of gaza from killing random people in the towns.  So what did the ydo? They did the modern liberal approach to gun violence: Restrict access to guns for lawful citizens.Except what they just discovered is what every conservative american knows: guns aren't the problem, the people with the guns are the problem and when you take away guns from good people, then the only people left with guns are the bad people who WONT give up their guns.Which is how you then have entire communities slaughtered or heavily reduced in number because no one in town has a gun to fight back.Part of the reason their attack was so effective was that everywhere they went, so long as they avoided the idf (which was easy so long as you were quick) then everyone they encountered was unable to fight back.  Had those towns had even a small number of people with guns and ammo, they could have delayed hamas groups long enough for idf to show up because the first place the army is going to go is the source of prolonged ongoing gunfire.
No that‚Äôs Shani louk .. apparently she‚Äôs alive in a hospital yesterday her mother confirmed.. but still no word since yesterday

That‚Äôs what they use(d) to share the hostage executions
Telegram, or 2ndyomkippurwar subreddit, brace yourself
Lmao of you hear the enemy is cutting off the heads of babies, doesn't that sound like propaganda at 1st? It's a good way to get support for your side if it's a lie or not. That's why people wanna see proof, to confirm if the information is legit or a way to condem them.
Thanks for your abundant insight‚Ä¶
No
Interesting.
i mean that is kind of the point
tht building just got wack fuked
watch the video again.  the missile comes down and hits the ground right next tothe base of the building.  the missile is designed to delay its detonation for 8-12 milliseconds to allow time for the bomb to basically burrow but before it begins to break apart.  THEN it explodes, and the blast will ltierally liquify (effectively) any ground around it temporarily (ground acts like water with enough kinetic impact) and the foundation of the building and groundthe walls are on literally ripples like water and shakes the foundation apart.  The issue is these bombs are DESIGNED to cause this, so you have buildings that are designed to withstand storms and such being hit by munitions designed to bring them down...so yes they're going to come down.  These arent mere cylinders packed with tnt blowing up on impact.
You're so deep in the propaganda and ignorance it's comedic. Youll say Anything to justify the atrocities of Hamas.
There‚Äôs usually a large hole blown into it, short buildings like this don‚Äôt typically crumble like I‚Äôve seen a lot of them do.
I mean the arabs have been calling for death to jews and death to america for decades, can anyone truly be surprised the jewish population has gotten tired of being the world's punching bag?
Ughhhh damn you can‚Äôt even run smh
Actually not true.  It's estimated that only 2% of isrealis own firearms.  The reservists who are issued firearms to carry are NOT issued ammunition as well.  They have incredibly strict gun ownership laws and ironically one of the first things done after the attack was an order went out ordering the government to work to arm the citizens as quickly as possible because the isreali population is in fact NOT armed.
I mean...are buildings REALLY meant to be constructed to resist 2000 pound bombs?
There goes that atm...
Not exactly True......I've seen police officers full on mag dump suspects that had overwhelming  firepower like Ak's Ar's Uzi's we see it all the time over here in America.....Doesn't matter if you have a machine gun or a pistol, of course having a tool like a multi shot rifle helps in terms of suppressing fire capabilities but it's not the end all be all in a gun fight......All that matters is the user of the weapon system....with the proper training of course.....only takes a couple well placed shots to end a threat and sometimes being prepared and having it on you might be the difference between a good day and a very different day that will be on the news.....and gun owners should also be educated on the fact that it's not always gonna come down to will I get home okay  at the end of the day.......sometimes instead  it's if I'm not getting home at the end of the day can I at least take the aggressors attention off of the unarmed so that the other potential victims can get home safely at the end of the day......  "if we are gonna carry also be prepared for the possibility to get buried" it's what my father used to tell me all the time
I am not here to debate you. What gave you the impression that I was?
1 the middle east is fucked historically they have so many layers of bad blood. its just a shitshow.   literally a parade of empires occupying/ colonizing/ opressing in  that whole area.  assyria, babylonian, helenic, roman, byzentine, caliphate, crusader , mongol,  muhgal, turk,  and british to name the ones I know off the top of my head.   2) post colonialism drew  new national boundaries  and people who were going to be independent  for the first time in a LONG LONG time wanted to fuck around and find out,  they fucked around, they found out.   and everyone has been fighting about who fucked around most and found out the most and what-exactly was  found out ever since.  a few groups keep fucking around and finding out,.  and they find out more and more each time they fuck around.    3) european jews look white   and western  and western powers fucked arround and found out some things  in Iran. Iran has money and  Iran has political issues.   External problmes are a good way to distract from internal ones, so  they  propagandize, arm and agitate.  becasue  they don't have to do the killing, they don't have to do the dying  and they get to milk the sweet sweet  suffering of  the fuckers and the fuckees that are finding out.
Zero response to what I actually wrote which tells me you literally don‚Äôt know anything about the subject. Just another person jumping on some bandwagon ill educated on the subject.
Westerners look at Media, and stand by a country that has been doing this for a century now, ignoring the people that have been suffering for that century and calling Israel a just hero when they truly know nothing. Israel controls Western Media, and as Abraham Lincon once said "‚ÄúYou can fool some of the people all of the time, and all of the people some of the time, but you can not fool all of the people all of the time.‚Äù You are being fooled. You know nothing about this conflict. I do not agree with the actions of Hamas, but you are out of your mind if you think this is one-sided terrorism, and that Pro-Israel is the "right" answer. Israel is one of the most racist, xenophobic countries in the world, as is any religious state. I just want people to stop dying, but that won't happen on Israel's watch.
If Allah willed it, your comrades would do it. You don‚Äôt understand the nature of submission, and that‚Äôs fine. One cannot expect an understanding of hierarchy and subordination from Catholics, who are fundamentally polytheists. Muslims do however. It is central to our creed.
Thanks , I am not familiar with a situation and want to learn, so I reached out to Reddit , that makes me an idiot ? Appreciate your contribution to this platform

Pretty crappy construction
How long did it take to form the valley?Was it caused by a fast acting sysmic event or something that was already there, and someone decided to build near the edge?

They have weapons but for protection, fighting against machine guns and rocket launchers with just rifles is not a winning combination.

Come again?
What do you mean by Oceania? Isnt that Australia and NZ? Dont bring us into it!
Channels name pls
We've always been at war with Oceania. Palestinians are the bad guys. Why wouldn't you just believe the news?
I wanna know the stories of this place. Are those towns rivals? Are there teenage lovers from one side whose parents want them to marry a nice person from the *right* side of the rift? Do they have summer games where they try to pelt each other across the rift with water balloons? I have to know.
Was it not the same video as the one posted in this thread? A different video?
It‚Äôs really not, you use that as a fuel for your bullshit. I have been in several wars and fought side by side with  many Muslims, (Sunni, Shia) and I‚Äôm a Catholic. The two religions aren‚Äôt very different and come from the same blood. They trusted me with their life and I trusted them with mine. They never raped and killed women and children. They never cut peoples heads off or tortured people. They didn‚Äôt live in hate unlike your ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù. I would go as far and say you probably never actually read the Quran. I myself have received many lessons in it. I would also say you are some keyboard warrior talking all kinds of shit and never have actually fought in war. You enjoy seeing your families living in rubble because of your so called ‚Äúbrothers‚Äù actions? They suffer because some idiot wants to hate so they may grasp power using your own religion as a tool for it. If you were true Muslim you would be fighting for those looking to destroy your people and religion. Those people sit directly in your Mosques corrupting your people minds. Your young men die to their bullshit and you just sit back and let it happen.
Not really, it makes money for those planes maintenance.
Yes, Hamas could also leave these buildings, which they do leaving the woman and children to die so they have more photos to spread for more sympathy. The only reason why you don't see that on the Israel side, is because they have an rocket defense system. Which is currently defending even more attacks from Gaza.
Just FYI, OP is a religious nutjob and keeps posting whacky shit in every subreddit they can about demons, angels, spirits, god. Basically like a Kpop superfan, but instead it's for christianity.
Trust the news? This is the most absurd thing I‚Äôve heard today.Edit : spelling
You should just trust the news buddy. Why try to find proof of anything? Israel is under attack and we've always been at war with Oceania
They are sending via text. Saying it's ok for Hamas to kill innocent people and Israel isn't able to defend its self is tone deaf. Correct in a war/conflict civilians pay the ultimate price. Look at Ukraine, they didn't even attack Russia and look what Russia has done to their country.You may be interested in researching Hamas more, especially their mission statements of ethnic cleansing of Israel.
Someone else misspeaks and you turn into a sarcastic shithead, only to also misspeak. The irony is as thick as your skull.
We can make a dumping ground outta this!
First off claiming racism , when talking about a society of violent people shows me your ignorance. Secondly, you must believe Hamas to be a charitable humanitarian organization by the way you speak.I pray that you live in Palestine, and that you are subject to these dictatorships. Because if that‚Äôs the case, it‚Äôs only a matter of time before they come for you for using a computer and expressing thoughts, even if they are the wrong thoughts.
Telegram is an encrypted message app, kinda like WhatsApp but it‚Äôs pretty much uncensored. They‚Äôre large group chats on there that act as separate pages sharing different videos.
I promise you , you are so wrong. Big bad U.S is coming and you guys are going to be flat land soon.
You do you, but the price could be your mental/emotional health.     For the record, I accidentally happens upon a telegram channel that had the content.  Never again.
Id telegram not just a messenger app?
I know I don‚Äôt. I know it‚Äôs going to be hard. But I‚Äôm forming very strong emotional opinions against Hamas over the existence of videos I have never seen.
If you really can‚Äôt help yourself, there are telegram channels that have this content.  You were warned.
R/combatfootage has a few videos
You don‚Äôt wanna see it, mate.
Is that line of trees on that bridge looking thing in the center
Ok but how are they sending these messages? And wouldn‚Äôt the hamas also receive the message and just leave? And do they provide someone for these families to be forcefully displaced to since if a move or die situation? Saying they send a warning before they send missiles is pretty tone deaf‚Ä¶ like they‚Äôre STILL sending major deadly force onto them so it doesn‚Äôt really matter‚Ä¶The problem is, the only people who are winning are those filling their pockets coz no matter which way it‚Äôs painted, civilians are the ones dying. They kill as many as they can in hopes to win. In hopes one side will beg for it to end. They don‚Äôt care if they have those to spare.
While I agree in some respects, it isn't farmers fields that are the target it's embedded Hamas in the area. They embed themselves in civilian targets like schools etc. Gaza is a HAMAS fortress with complex tunnels and networks. Israel is at a state of war and HAMAS has directly opened the war. Israel still even sends messages of where they are attacking to atleast give civilians an opportunity to go somewhere else. Which for obvious reasons is challenging or near impossible. You are picking a side when you defend HAMAS whether you know it or not.The areas history itself is tragic but still gives no excuse to HAMAS' actions.I certainly fell sympathy for civilians on both sides. And we are just pawns in a world built by the rich to make themselves wealthier.
I‚Äôm gonna make it!
Completely agree.the cycle of hate continues.....in the 21st century.
Everything reminds me of her‚Ä¶..
How you crash in the vastness of the sky #links
I'm inclined to agree.
It‚Äôs literally a war crime and open fields = food‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre starving them out‚Ä¶ how‚Äôs that any better??? I didn‚Äôt pick a side. There‚Äôs no civilian winners in war. Only the rich win, they gamble and line their pockets. We‚Äôre just pawns and live stock.
Solid edit to your statement videos I have seen have shown these munitions being used in open fields not dense city centers.
Good job justifying mass murder.There is tragic loss of life. As I said earlier "sure free Palestine but f*** HAMAS"I wonder why all the surrounding Arab states including Egypt have a closed door policy?
I can agree especially when they accepted them on their land it may have not been the best part but they took em in when nobody would shit needs to stop and end now
Like the US? And many others that are no different?
Meanwhile Isreal drops phosphorus on innocent Palestinian families‚Ä¶ your point still ain‚Äôt standing
Thank God
I‚Äôm genuinely stumped how one sides fight is terrorism but dropping phosphorus over Gazas civilians doesn‚Äôt make the Israeli gov terrorists‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt support violence of any kind. I‚Äôm just stumped at the double standard here‚Ä¶
Everyone is scared
In theory, it seems that way but without 100% proof then it‚Äôs just a theory at this point. It could have been a number of other countries aswell.
Your daft as all hell to think that would end the problems
It is war. Picking sides just makes them more money and they just keep going. Don‚Äôt think this 100 year war couldn‚Äôt possibly have been ended earlier. It could‚Äôve, it‚Äôs just profitable. And now we sit here watching each parties civilians be brutalised and murdered like chess peices.
Agreed! The first thing that came to mind was Deathwing.
It is a crime but this isn‚Äôt phosphorus. It‚Äôs thermite incendiary.
Not every religion preaches violence
Is that only one city ? or nah?
1 year ago is "a couple"?
This is why i turned away frm religions
So you tell, to kill millions of innocent people ? ... Hamas !== Gaza man.
Ah yes because using the name "DemonicWhisper" immediately invalidated any point I could have regardless of who I actually am and what I know.
I make it about religion because that is what it is about. You may convince your cattle otherwise. Free men know what this is about.

Ok retard terrorists are terrorists and will be treated like terrorists and some yellow belly retards defect
This is the truth! He is not a retard, you &amp; a lot of people who are easily being brainwashed into hating other human beings. He is not defected to Palestinians side; he's speaking the truth!
The Jews who defected to the other side a retarded and blind this war will stop many deaths in the future
Yes it‚Äôs true. I have seen the video :( so sad

Iran game them the resources and has been giving them resources for some time.
Israel never took woman, broke their legs, then raped and murdered her. Then drove around the strip with her lifeless body in the back of a pickup truck. An eye for an eye leaves the world blind.&amp;#x200B;Israels reign over palestine and gaza wasnt good, but they never did this shit. Blast them all to hell as far as im concerned. Every last one.
So with Hamas being the aggressor, they can't cry victim.  People say well it's not Palestinians, it's just Hamas, but then there are all the videos of Palestinians running out and kicking/punching the hostages - what we would call regular every day Palestine.
Elon Musk?

Well trained but still dead.
Killed him and buried him with one shot.
Why does this come off as a propaganda video ?
It's always innocent civilians that pay the ultimate price :/ (on both sides). This whole thing sucks.
I thought the use of phosphorus a war crime?
I'm pretty sure Israel was attacked by all their neighbors multiple times . And has grown each time by defeating their enemies and taking land as spoils.  Maybe stop attacking them and Israel will chill the fuck out
It‚Äôs dumb because even news channels play the videos. It‚Äôs news
I read somewhere that they consider any shared footage a, "Promotion of terrorism"
They need tacos.
Why the censorship?

Mind linking me the telegram groups?
Every year the Palestinians shoot thousands of rockets into Israel and their terrorist Hamas government believes that Israel has no right to exist. If you get rockets shot at you, and your family and countrymen get killed, would you run up and give them a hug? The first couple times, sure you might think it‚Äôs just a couple bad apples, but after months and years of continuous rocket fire and border murders, eventually, you realize that they‚Äôre not very friendly. If anything, Israel has been more than patient with them. They usually give the civilians a chance to leave areas that are going to be bombed and try to limit unneeded casualties. This is the opposite of Hamas who literally just murdered babies and unarmed music festival goers. What needs to change is the Palestinian people need to realize that peace is better than war. They need to take it upon themselves to embrace at attitude of bettering themselves and remove their terrorist government. They need to disarm and accept a two state solution. That is the best case scenario.
It‚Äôs almost like they could dig wells with their money and not make rockets, clown
Rip to the innocent

Yup. Saw that on r/holdmycoffin at least a couple of years ago.

Not soldiers Terrorists, make sure you distinguish the two
Well its a multiple choice question. Are they;A) Unlawful combatants not to be given POW status (ie execute them as spies)Or B) Soldiers guilty of war crimes  (the punishment for that in Isreal is death)Let's just hope one of them is the son of someone powerful that Isreal can exchange for some women and children.

KABOOM!
Yes. Though I don‚Äôt believe I have heard of reports or doing so intentionally so I cannot speak to that, but their rockets for many years were not particularly sophisticated and they would accidentally land in Gazas own territory due to various misfires. I‚Äôm not aware of report of this happening in this particular conflict. Here is an article that discussing many occurrences over the years of this happening. https://www.hrw.org/news/2021/08/12/palestinian-rockets-may-killed-civilians-israel-gaza
Well they certainly didn't eat those and if they did I would really loooove to know how
You‚Äôre* (x2)
Don't give them any ideas.
Killing people.  Gain more support when the massive counterattack comes and kills a few 100 kids. It's just a never end circle jerk of killing that has been going on all my life. I would hope that the IDF would be more measured this time ( not that they deserve it) with an eye towards the future.  Either way, Hamas must be destroyed.  How could Israel be cought of guard so bad?
The sooner you realize there is no god, things come into perspective, and you see just how petty and primitive humans are.

My unpopular opinion is that air shows are a pointless waste of resources and it's absurd that we still do them. Taking vintage planes out for a spin is fine, but there's no reason to be doing anything remotely risky.

Where is the evidence of that? I‚Äôm only ever referencing one claim. That is the founds given to Iran is what caused this. You added to it by say it did because now Iran doesn‚Äôt have to worry about humanitarian money. There isn‚Äôt any evidence that points to being true. That is what this is DIP nothing more. It is asked to cause a further divide and blame Joe Biden for something not even in his realm of control.
perfectly said
Not once at all did I say that the 6 billion we unfroze caused this.I said that it frees up more of their own assets (which they are absolutely using). They would be funding such attacks anyway, but now they don't have to set aside extra for humanitarian spending.

The P-63 has terrible forward visibility, he couldn‚Äôt have seen the B-17 at the AoA he was at
Ummm, that's not ideal...
75yo pressure cooker going boom.
Anybody got any info on this? Where, who, what? Was this recent?
I can‚Äôt see any way anyone could have survived that. That was brutal
Did everybody die involved?
Never understand why people poke hornets nests

Even if you erase religion  conflict is human nature no matter how hard one denies this.....Animals have fights for turf and resources much like we do or did back in the days of 1st man.....Men and women have been killing each other since we could pick up a rock, make a fist,  discover fire etc.  If mankind loose religion then we fight over money,  if we loose money then we fight over turf,  if we loose turf then we fight over resources. if we loose all that then we fight for our rights to those things. You see?  This concept of peace is a false reality....WW1 "the war to end all wars" Ww2 soon after came and went, as well as Vietnam, Korea and others. You see? This war will wage on and there will be others after or during. Religion is just another excuse to fight no matter who you rep. God, Allah, The Devil it doesn't matter. Everyone will find a reason to argue, kill and humiliate. Some of you are in conflict right now although not kinetic, when we disagree about things here or in conversation.  Its a natural thing Mankind tries so hard to deny because it disgusts us at the same time for the simple fact of witnessing the things we can do to each other just so we have a sense of victory or purpose here in this world. The "art" of warfare or conflict is seared into our DNA I think by now we would have all woken up to that fact after the countless wars today and in history we have had. War is a necessary evil. No matter what anyone says " There can not be peace without war" many famous people have said.....the peace never came centuries later......Because IT DOESN'T EXIST

Maybe they're just super dedicated to their craft lmao

That doesn‚Äôt make the claim that 6 Billion is humanitarian aid caused this.
Each hour more of our battle-hardened brothers arrive from all across the Islamic world. Each day we take more of Israel‚Äôs women and children. It will not end well for them.
wow
That sure looks like Syria‚Ä¶
where?
Hamas is killing ‚Äútheir‚Äù people. Hiding behind the innocents. I‚Äôm not picking a political side here‚Ä¶. But this is where my ethical line is drawn on this matter. Attack military and economic objectives. Specifically targeting civilians for rape, murder and kidnapping is unbecoming of an administration that claims to be for its people. They have provoked a nation with the will and means to retaliate with hellfire and now these brave soldiers are nowhere to be found!? You want to do battle? Meet the enemy on the field. I wish I could go back to the 40s-50s but we are here now and what I see is Israel cares for its people more than hamas cares for their own.
There are few reasons, the most important is, if the president of the USA will not help 100 procent, for sure he will not be elected for the second time. Jewish people have so much money, influence and power, you can‚Äôt go around them. I think that‚Äôs also the reason Saudi Arabi√´ find out that people will not need oil any more. If they want to make business here  on this planet, you will for sure encounter Jewish people.  They can‚Äôt do business whit a country or Jewish people if you are in state of war or have very difficult diplomatic relations. That the reason is that they buy a lot of wapens, I don‚Äôt think so. The Americans were not so happy to sell them art of the state technology, because they are smart to update it and to improve it. For exempel the patriot system was very late delivered in the first golf war, a lot of reasons, but what I think is because they copy the technology. What happened, before they system was operational, they already updated the software of the patriot system. End the there are many other reasons more, but the Israel is a very reliable partner.
Collateral damage involving a child is sad. However, invading someone's home and choosing to murder them is a little bit different.
both sides have committed war crimes, Can you say that There have not been Israeli solders who have murdered Palestinian families???????
Use it as a dump?üëç
This entire thing is just so fucking sad
This entire thing is so so so fucked and sad
Isreal should kill all children women and man No mercy any in gaza strip kill all people in gaza strip and Isreal burn every children women man .......continue Isreal don't stop you fight with animals
let em burn...
Are you retarded?Fire mortars from an apartment building, at armed military forces, you can expect a retort from said military.
blood for blood
They‚Äôre about to get an education that‚Äôs for sure
Not sure what your watching but Gaza bout to get leveled homie
Burn Baby Burn!!
it was texas raidersthe wiki mentions it, but also you can see the signature red tail in the video

Not part of any 5%.   Conversely, you appear to be someone who believes cows are sacred and there are multiple gods.   Fairy tale shit, ya know ?
OP doesn‚Äôt  give af about cnn.   I see two sides both engaging in killing women and children.  Shameful across the board, religion agnostic.
There‚Äôs a secondary explosion in a residential area‚Äî say what you will‚Äî fact is that says something about the people who put the explosives there.

Have them FEAR you Isreal . Let their God sort them out
That how karma whores work. They get it wrong on purpose so more people will comment to correct it.
Respect for not arguing for nothing and accept that you fucked up
Burning Hamas üëç
Those "innocents" were celebrating, I watched a video of Palestinian children hitting a young Israeli boy that was taken hostage with a stick. They are just as guilty as Hamas of they were truly for peace they would fight against terrorism not condone it. They have teens running around with the gunmen taking videos spitting on raped and killed women.
Have land, will use!
average russian reaction
Oh my god....they were roomates
I believe it was show that the fighter has limited cockpit visibility, and at the high bank it was in, the pilot may well have not seen the bomber at all.The NTSB has at this point mainly blamed that and bad airshow planning.
Oh it will someday!
no, they were clearly let down from the impact plume
If only half of the men had guns they could have taken these assholes down.
If someone pays your rent do you suddenly have more disposable income to spend in other areas? Obviously yes. Humanitarian aid to hostile nations absolutely frees up additional resources to fund their activities.
No, they were wearing helmets and kneepads.
They prod Israel to get a reaction to publicize it to other Palestinians,  and feed the hate they have for Jews.
The P63 was in a high g turn and could not see the B17 from his attitude.
Ohmafuckinggaawd!
Ermergaaawd!
The small fighter deliberately took down the B-17. There‚Äôs no way that was accidental. I‚Äôm thinking it had to be a personal grudge.
They really farm right to the edge of that chasm.
Well put. üëçüèΩ
I don't know. But I know no religion has the answers. We are on a speck of dust in a vast universe we barely comprehend. But, sure, your book of fairytales explain everything.
Mr. President a plane has hit the second plane
Think next time.
Damnit can we stop destroying all our B-17s
It‚Äôs true kind of ironic most the Israelites want total extermination. Sounds like certain Austrian Painted
Some propeller aircraft are actually jets, but you're right. Both of these planes have piston engines
I think they were talking about the planes
Sad thing she wasn‚Äôt even a soldier and some of them were civilians
This was at an airshow in Texas. A lot of planes in relatively close proximity to each other, it is bound to happen sooner or later.
Still not a good thing to have inside of you lol
Hamas, but theyvare using civilians and their infrastructure as shields. When it gets bombed, they cry out and point their fingers at the jews for retaliating when they were shot at and their people killed.
Damn, those are relics. Shame.
Hamas has literally said this was planned and funded with and by the Iranians.
If you ever see the pic of the pilot in the bomber as it‚Äôs going down it‚Äôs truly harrowing
You can watch her whole thought process from the rear. "Oh my god i should...Maybe if I...Yeah there's nothing."

Nothing it's just means that he was meant to die in technology and equipment dating back to the 1940s .
Whoever gave them the resources and training definitely has a plan. Hamas must know the IDF will enter Gaza, it will be a bloodshed if they do and maybe give Iran and others an excuse to get involved because I can‚Äôt understand why Hamas would make a blitz, kidnap people and then return to Gaza for no reason, they‚Äôre barbaric but they clearly aren‚Äôt stupid. I don‚Äôt want to be a conspiracy theorist but I have a feel that something bigger is at play.
Who made the devil?
Op: We should stop with religious wars and nonsense.You: nuh uh. My God is better than your god.Yet Jews, Christians, and Muslims worship the same God of the Bible.
Inelastic physics.
Is Israel scared to send in troops instead of just bombing building that don‚Äôt discriminate between civilians and soldiers.
Man humanity is dumb. Rejoicing over innocent lives lost no matter the nationality is disgusting. Nothing glorious to celebrate. I feel bad for the people that think this is OK just shows how badly they are brain washed.
Holy fuck. There was so much sky though.
Well if you had 96 year olds piloting you might have situation like this one so is it rly so unreasonable to assume?
Which one is based on testing and replicability again? I always get the two confused.
Thank you it seems both sides never want to admit fault nor actually help each other. Seems like everyone today just wants to play the victim or hero. Rather we should strive to find resolutions and diplomacy. There needs to be recognition that there are some good things that have happened with republicans and democrats. However, that being said we do need anti corruption laws in place to this circus. Until then the show must/will go on. Money and power perverts truth and true progress/healthy growth.
When a guy lands in a music festival with unarmed civilians and 250 were killed, more injured, and more killed while fleeing and that not being the only attack on purely civilians ... people getting pulled from cars and getting murdered, going house to house and executing... kids being targeted... they went on a horrific spree on civilians. it's a difficult situation over there for sure, tragedy on both sides. If they stuck to military targets it's a different thing entirely. I am only commenting on that day not the tragic history of the area. We've also seen Israels reaction.
oh mah gawd
This is a helpful point of view.
I'm not a real doctor, but most people who don't support Isreal in their imperialism and atrocities also don't support the US imperialism and atrocities either.
Did they know something was coming? Yes.  But it needs to be understood that the complexity of this attack was insane, and the warnings they had gotten were not specific.  What were they supposed to do, not celebrate any holidays and remain on high alert indefinitely waiting for an attack that might not even come?
Ironically you can blame the UK.  In the 1920s they had been given the mandate by the league of nations to settle jews in Palestine.  At the time, there was no palestinian people and the only population groups were nomadic bedouin's and ironically, jews who had made their way back to jerusalem on their own.  The majorityh ethnic group in the region of actual residents was jewish for a while.The problem is that the UK deliberatel ysabotaged their mandate and they assigned as the "Chief" of resettlement a fervant anti-jew arab who began immigrating arabs from all over the region.  These people became the first "palestinians" because until then there was no such people.  WHen they arrived they began pogrom after pogrom trying to kill the local jews.The UK would abandon its mandate in the 30s, and the reformed United Nations would then try again 1947/48 by which point there had been discussions and deals in multiple channels with what was literally a new population of people that had spent 20 years living in the region after coming there.Ironically from the get go Palestine was supposed to have a nation in the west in gaza, and a nation in the east in the westbank.  The local jews had agreed to this even.  The issue though is that ltierally every single arab nation said NO to the deal.  On teh day that the UN released its authority in the region, every single surrounding arab nation attacked beginning a wave of wars that Isreal somehow repeatedly won.  From tehre on, it's a complicate back/forth wave of history that gets more violent and complicated as time goes on.  By this point, there is no one side that's innocent or at fault.  They've simply been fighting for 5 generations now.
Smaller plane never saw the bigger plane. He was doing a high g turn and the bigger plane would have been *below* him relative to his attitude and not visible.
When a plane flies directly into another plane, they have a tendency to explode catastrophically.
First operational jets entered service during WWII. But they weren't the planes in this video.
The extremists would not be able to function if it were not for the support of the people. Israel has given so many concessions over the decades and look what it got them, their people slaughtered not for military or political gain, just because. Israel going to have to do what we learned to do in WWII to stop this BS, bomb the populous into submission to the point where there is no will left to support those that they now support.
That was 1 of the 5 remaining B17 that are still airworthy. I assume it was [Sentimental Journey (44-83514)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentimental_Journey_(aircraft\)) or [Texas Raiders (44-83872)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Raiders).
I agree because evil is man-made. But if religion was erased, the earth might have a chance.
There is no devil. Well, maybe Hamas. Or ISIS. Or Warren Jeffs. Man made up the devil to excuse his own evil. Too arrogant/self-absorbed to take the blame for their evil. Make up a god and devil to blame.
At the moment this is just a rumor.  Theres nothing on any of their telegrams or discords indicating such, there is even a proof of life video from later.
Why does there have to be an explanation? Why is it so hard to say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know.‚Äù? Why is not knowing, worse than righteous terror?
Source?
Congratualtions, you are a victim of propaganda.  In this case, it's propaganda by hamas becasue what they do is place all their military hardware within and underneath civilian targets.That way even when they lose the military ahrdware in a strike, they GAIN propaganda power to effect people like you because they can show civilian homes being destroyed.If you're curious, ukraine was also doing this and apparently still is to an extent, especially early on in the ukraine conflict, many of the strikes in ukraine on civilian targets ( a mall is the best example where theres video and images) was because ukraine was storing military hardware there.While that's no longer the case because it backfired, it was powerful starting propaganda there as well.
I made a mistake with misremembered information, I did try and correct it by editing my original post with the official information.
Look I never would call for violence but can we just imbed her with Hamas fighters and see what happens? Maybe airdrop her down onto the Gaza Strip with a name tag and let them know she‚Äôs coming and than just see how long she lasts
Thanks.  I appreciate.  Whenever I see something talked about in the media especially in the Middle East I try to educate myself as much as possible.  Last night I watched some testimony from some Palestinians on you tube and Tik tok.  And then some Jews from the region explaining how Palestinianshave been treated over the last centuries.  It seems like they have been very mistreated and the fighting started a long time ago and it‚Äôs been an ongoing rivalry for many many years.  Each side trying to one up each other by whatever means possible. And the poor conditions in Gaza.  But that doesn‚Äôt justify murdering children.  Nothing does.It needs to stop.  Both sides.  I‚Äôm not taking sides I take the side of peace.  There‚Äôs always a way.  Stop treating someone like they‚Äôre less than you because you don‚Äôt believe like they believe.  I remember jews being made fun of in America in grade school in Texas.  And blacks.  It would make me cry in my bed at night as a little girl.  It makes me happy to see the one Jewish boy from school doing very very well for himself after struggling for a long time to get an education.  He is quite wealthy now. üëèüèªI refuse to let the US media tell me how I should think and feel about a conflict.  Thanks to social media and people putting their testimony in front of a camera I can be well informed.  If someone chooses not to be informed they are ignorant, they should take the time to find out what‚Äôs going on first.
It‚Äôs possible the attack was partially funded as a result of the 6 Billion released.  It doesn‚Äôt matter the 6 Billion was designated to be used only for humanitarian needs - like food.   If they cut those costs from their other accounts, that frees up money that can be diverted to anything else.  It also doesn‚Äôt matter if the 6 Billion hasn‚Äôt been spent yet.  The anticipation of funds has the same effect as actually having the funds.  Russia is increasing their military spending by 70% next year based on the projection of elevated future oil export revenues.  If I won the Powerball this week but couldn‚Äôt claim it for three months while I assemble a team of lawyers and investment professionals, I would still quit my job today and start going on a spending spree maxing out my credit cards in anticipation of the future funds.
A real muslim is a real piece of shit on the society of earth. they bring nothing to the table except backwards idealogies and stinky armpits.
The pilot was born 20 or 30 years after the war ended, according to this. He most certainly was not a B17 pilot in WWII.
No they have airbags
I guess no one gets your joke, OP deserves these downvotes for calling a WWII bomber a ‚Äújet‚Äù ‚Ä¶
You sunk my battleship
What are you talking about?
That‚Äôs not a jet
Yeah! How dare Israel react to terrorists attacking and killing their women, children, and elderly! If my neighbor raped and killed my family I would be really concerned about how he is doing through this traumatic experience!
source? who is accounting for rape and killing women and children and are they to be trusted? and does this so called act of terror excuse isreal over the past 75 years and victimize them again? and how are the isreali military dealing with the matter? i sure hope they arent comiting genocide in ghaza or else i side with the terrorist, oh wait nvm they have been raping, toturing, killing, poisoning, segregating, kidnaping, comitting genocide, falsely reporting, falsely accusing, and a number other crimes over the past century, sorry to say but I'm siding with the terrorist on this one.

I see. Well i'm not a doctor by profession so you know more but i'm not a fan of forceps being stitched into me anyway.
Do you actually think the wave they sent in has an exit strategy? It was a suicide attack. They have no end game, it was "send those young men to die to get sympathy for our cause by murdering everyone" that was their wad, now that they shot it they will play the victim card.
He [went to another hospital](https://www.dawn.com/news/709442/forceps-left-in-mans-abdomen-termed-preventable-error) at Karachi but they too were demanding payment. Not sure how it ended for him.

No otherwise those militias driving trough town and roubding up people like that would be shot from every corner and every building
Hundreds if not thousands of Israeli civilians have been killed on sight by these hamas not to mention hundreds being taken hostage from their own homes!
This is not a pair of scissors. It is a pair curved artery forceps, probably Mayo Artery Forceps.Scissors don't have a locking ratchet.
There is and always has been an extremely influential lobby on capitol hill representing Jewish/ Israeli interests.  The US has been a guarantor of Israeli sovereignty since the inception of the state and Israel has acted as a strategic ally to the US, and the west more broadly, throughout its history.  There are many shared interests and values that make Israel a defacto part of the West in many respects.
There are fine lines everywhere and not everyone takes it seriously
After reading wrapped up and oppressed I stop reading.  Anyone truly educated or knows a real Muslim knows to wrap up is a choice if the woman.
Can you point to the parody here, please?It looks more like someone was just making things up and presenting it as fact.
Israel has a large population of ‚ÄòPalestinians‚Äô so you can be sure that Hamas has killed them, they don‚Äôt discriminate except by where you are.They don‚Äôt stop and ask for identification or ask questions. That should be obvious from the videos.
Things don‚Äôt have to be true to be upvoted, or verified, and in some cases, parody or faulty logic is highly up-votable because of the type of humour many redditors have.
Sound like there citizens needed a 2nd amendment? Am i wrong?
My mistake -I was going by being *born* in 1945.... You are correct. They'd be much older
What does this have to do with who was piloting?
One of the oldest on board the b-17 was 88 years old. The rest were under 70
I think part of asymmetrical warfare is provoking over the top responses to galvanize the population that isn't ready to fight or participate in other means. There are people that want to starve and kill the general populace of Palestine in the name of fighting Hamas. Seems like it's getting the response they expected.
My dad was 11 when WW2 ended. He turned 89 this year. I think any remaining WW2 pilots would be closer to 100 than 80.
Did you really just post this video with a uninformed title, and not even think to look up anything about it?
Happens frequently at airshows
The VERY FIRST PICTURE from that article:https://preview.redd.it/4zkbk5rwzdtb1.jpeg?width=1290&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ca8b51164aca3f2dd70684626295a156b7f6b145Wow, so according to this (obviously wrong) caption, the B-17 fell apart midair BEFORE colliding with the P-63! So I guess it fell apart on its own, and the P-63 just flew into the rubble? Certainly doesn‚Äôt look that way in the video! Seriously, it AMAZES me how such an obviously wrong caption can sit on an article like this for SO LONG! And it‚Äôs the FIRST DAMN THING YOU SEE in the article! Do they not have proofreaders at Business Insider?
Miscalculation you say?
wtf when was this!?
Is that what they were doing?
Practicing all their life for this
Imagine fucking dying in a tragedy just for a random redditor to say that your death is fake
Looks like they are
Why do people say ‚Äúfrom an American‚Äù?Lots of people don‚Äôt live in the Middle East, let alone follow what‚Äôs going on there.Bravo to yourself for actually digging in though!
You think... you *actually* think that the original pilots are still piloting these today?At the very youngest, they would be ~~80~~ 96 years old...Who upvotes this garbage?
All that air and they couldn't crash in peace somewhere else. That's some final destination shit.
So was it left behind or did the run tread through the handles, cause mistakes happen and it's one of the reasons every tool in a operating room is accounted for. It's been that way for quite a while in western medicine,
OPs have never looked at their own posts.
By putting their head quarters in hospitals they hide behind there citizens and when the head quarters get bombed the blood is very much on there hands it‚Äôs sad
I love the non thinly guised racism and absolute lack of grasp on history in your post. You voluntarily wrote a dissertation to feel smart and contribute nothing of substance besides making yourself look like a vague ass without any actual discourse. You support apartheid and substantial genocide with no voice but the moment a conversation comes up where you can skim a page or two and try to sound informed with an excuse to be racist you type social commentaries from a bubble, quite pathetic how western identity politic rats think they're politically informed just because they can name the president
With her flipping like that, I wonder if she‚Äôd get badly tangled up when/if it deployed?
What other choice do you have? You‚Äôre born into an open air prison and what just stay there your whole life? They don‚Äôt have access to control basic human rights and needs. Isreal cuts off their water supply and only delivers them minimal amounts
SO ARE THE ISREALI SOLDIERS WHO HAVE BEEN OPENLY DOING THE SAME TERRORIST??? don‚Äôt apply your morals to one side and not the other hypocrite
Hamaz is a terrorist organisation but the IDF is far worse.
And what should she do?
You‚Äôre taking up for one side when it‚Äôs the reaction to the other side‚Äôs oppression imagine that. I bet you also ignore the videos if hamas fighters in other areas saving children and woman and saying it‚Äôs against the religion. It‚Äôs fucking war isreal beat Palestine like a dog and now the dog is biting back. Nothing else should be expected unless you‚Äôre some kind of moron too dumb to see a beat animal will lash out. It‚Äôs bad I agree 100% but that‚Äôs fucking war buddy you got bad actors and good ones. But you don‚Äôt get to ignore that they had the same thing done to them over decades and no one has helped them
They literally were dominant Palestinians Muslims for 600 years under the ottomans isreal occupying them in their land for generations because the wester countries said it‚Äôs cool after WW2 is bullshit. Isreali soldiers killed 32 Palestinian children in the West Bank and is in video shooting them as there were just walking. Any group of people who is having their children killed would obviously start a war and murder the people of their oppressors. What delusional crack pipe are you smoking

How???? Did a MTF fall asleep in the cockpit??? What a fuckin way to die... smh
They're both planes but neither are jets
probably from Afghanistan tbh
 see and ethics says you can't do that.   Fucking atheists   that post this shit are all the same.  you're just as bad as the religious extremists.  you want to force the rest of the world to believe what you believe and you're just too bent to say it outright.   Gervais is a cunt
Nah, the belts saved them.
They put their headquarters in hospitals, and have kids around as they shoot rockets.
OP didn't research this topic at all, karma farming poophead. They were the P63 and B17, 2 extremely rare aircraft (neither of them have ***jet propulsion***) were lost due to what is believed to be a miscalculation from a drone operator as well as poor coordination on the planners part.
Wow... the stupidity of that statement is amazing.
Thought this was cgi.  But i guess it's real.
They lived through WWII flying those planes just to die at a laid back airshow.Fucking tragic.EDIT: made a mistake with misremembered info, here's the full scoop - I'm leaving my original comment as a point of integrity - I fucked up, and I'll own it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022_Dallas_airshow_mid-air_collision
And fortune cookies too!
God has a hard on for American marines. He plays His games, we play ours. In as a good gesture for God blessing us with so much power, we keep heaven stocked with fresh souls.
Wow
And then?
It just reminds me of the stories about bombers being shot down over Europe during WWII and disintegrating on there downward spiral. Just image if it happened at 30000 feet.

What‚Äôs weird is that there were some Russians killed aswell
Technically it was South Korea that released Irans frozen funds for humanitarian purposes apparently
I‚Äôm not a pilot, and know basically squat about planes. But why didn‚Äôt the smaller plane ‚Äúpull up‚Äù or turn hard or something. Obviously the big boy can‚Äôt do it that fast but jeez it‚Äôs like the smallPlane didn‚Äôt even try to avoid

That is a better analogy, but who forces Indians to stay in their land? They are still citizens of the U.S. and some parts of the U.S. are racist sure, but other parts are very diverse. If you are talking about what the U.S. did when we founded the country, then yeah, it sucked for Indians. Basically every country that gets founded is founded by blood. If you want to hold on to that history and hate people that had nothing to do with it, they can live in their own hell.
Beautiful
agree 100% - Faith unites people but religion divides them all.
Yes. Insulting people however I‚Äôve found isn‚Äôt the best way for people to come around to your view.
You mean nazi Israel üáÆüá±
Lol, neither of those planes are jets. Both are propeller aircraft ffw. No one looks before posting something nowadays??
Oh god, I expected to get rickrolled. RIP. ‚òπÔ∏è
The plane that caused the accident was a p63, it has terrible visibility. The b17 was in his ‚Äúblind spot‚Äù.
And they were both planes
Assholes, maybe. I rather have an asshole who gets results in my government than a nice person who is a complete asshat. Instead of working on issues that will benefit all Americans the Democrats are more concerned about expanding government, raising taxes, and making sure grown men can use the little girls room.
This was in Dallas, TX last year. I grew up right by that airport.
Do you really want to go down the list of what Democrats blamed Trump for from 2016-2020? I‚Äôm confident while that non sense was happening you didn‚Äôt take a few minutes to post on Reddit the same thing you took the time to post on here about Biden.
Their souls will burn in hell for thisü§¨
So sadüò™
Which part?! All the airborne debris? That big ass fireball? The spectators reactions? What exactly looks 'fake' to you?!
Y'all are going to hell
The fighter jet sort of just..._disintegrated_ upon collision. That's terrifying.
Neither was a jet, B-17 Dallas Raiders I think and a P-63
That‚Äôs how you die
They know that they fucked up with this attack, straight low blow and now they are scared knowing us Americans are gonna give a good ol fashion right hook
I think if all religion were completely erased, humans would still kill each other for stupid reasons.   Religion is just a pretext for doing horrible things to each other.

Sorry ma‚Äôam, but you failed this course
Well he isn't right, It was not even 1 year ago. Don't make me feel old, because I remembered it like it was just 6 months ago.
Your argument is completely flawed. Palestine, Iran, and the rest of the trinity of terror. Have been invading, murdering civilians, oppressing people wiping out entire lineage as a families. I‚Äôm sorry that you for some reason think that that makes them innocent. Look how they treat their own people. Wrapped up, oppressed, punished for letting hair fall out, beaten, and murdered, if disagreeing with elders. They are a complete dictator and totalitarian type of society, not regime, society!  that means their society values and what they are fighting for is completely flawed. I am fairly certain that if you expressed any sympathy for things that they don‚Äôt believe in, you would be the next one on the back of one of those pick up trucks. Being paraded around like the worthless piece of trash, they view as.I completely stand with the retaliation from Israel. And if the Palestinians can‚Äôt figure out how to live peacefully. They probably shouldn‚Äôt be living anyway. Animals, at least have common sense they don‚Äôt attack for fun.
It's in front and below him hidden under the noseDidn't see him maybe even until they hit
Ah yes, the porn star that‚Äôs not even respected by her own people contributes valuable advice. Don‚Äôt forget to go live on Facebook
Looks like success is erupting in Gaza!!
Still under investigation but the general theory is the fighter pilot lost track of which B-17 he was supposed to follow, didn't see this one until it was too late.
This seems the most believable
How it that even possible? Looks deliberate? Anybody know why this happened?!
Funny. https://www.npr.org/2023/10/08/1204545880/the-biden-administration-is-building-a-controversial-part-of-the-border-wall-in-

IDK why you are getting downvoted. Thanks !
Two things can be correct1. The funds were not used in the recent terror attack on Israel.2. It looks bad to release 6 Billion in aid to a country that monetarily supports the group behind the recent attacks.Of course the Republicans will spin it to make it sound as worse as possible, but that‚Äôs politics.
The airboss...they never saw each other, just doing what they were told. Airboss put them on a collision course and didn't realize it....
Both WWII vintage aircraft.
That is the rumor but did he guarantee that another country was going to pay for it?
I think you don't even know what propaganda means

That's funny because you're not wrong. üòÖ
Yeah it‚Äôs really a shame you get your utilities turned off after you commit war crimes and and rape/pillage.
I mean if a video that is obviously very real looks fake to you you have a distorted perception.
They would stone her to death.
You mean this isn't real life?
You‚Äòre being online too much buddy.
Thanks!
Which one ran over the stop sign?
Except that the current government looks morronic incompetant now and after this is over their careers are done, because they let this happen. This is far worse than 9/11 because Israel had all the defences needed to prevent this and didn't. This doesn't look like a conspiracy, this looks like the worst incompetence in Israels history.
Bidens building the wall. How about that?
Not a jet
Don't know why you're getting downvoted bud. It does look fake. Obviously it isn't, but it does look heavy fake!
B17, p63
ad hominem, nice. What am I missing?
You're right. Found a report about it here: [https://www.businessinsider.com/texas-airshow-collision-fighter-jets-b17-p63-2022-11?op=1&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T](https://www.businessinsider.com/texas-airshow-collision-fighter-jets-b17-p63-2022-11?op=1&amp;r=US&amp;IR=T)
Neither of those was a jet
Air show . Couple years ago I think
There was a plane and a collission, but I didn't see a jet.
Are you dumb? Evacuate to where? There‚Äôs steel fences with barbed wires surrounding all of Gaza, and military patrols guarding those fences, where should you evacuate to? Actual ignorant animal, if the people dare get close to those fences the Israeli army has a right to literally gun you down. So now riddle me this where should the civilians evacuate to? Up your gaping ass? Cause that seems like the only logical solution in this nonsensical argument of yours
It's from an air show :( if I remmember it was a b17 and a mustang who colided. Could be wrong
So you‚Äôve been tired for the past 2 years of your accounts existence stop making excuses for being a man child that knows nothing about politics, stop sticking your nose in matters you know nothing about
Some made up stories from thousands of years ago about gods and profits and promised land.  These fanatics just don‚Äôt realise it was a story and will kill for it.

agreed. Russia‚Äôs propaganda disinformation machine is just as strong as Amerikkka‚Äôs tbh. If not better
Amerikkka sees opportunity to use its war machine and make money. That‚Äôs why
When/where was this?
Yes, America sees an opportunity to use it‚Äôs war machine and make money
this is nothing new unfortunately. They been fighting over land forever. This will never endhttps://youtu.be/1wo2TLlMhiw?feature=shared
RIP to all the people on those planes...
Your so dumb you‚Äôre the one that‚Äôs misinformed Hamas and Hasbulla have every right to defend themselves. This has been going on for 75 years too long. The people have suffered and have been slaughtered have lived in fear got their lands and rights stripped away from them, so fuck you and fuck every Israeli supporter I hope you fucking burn in the deepest pits of hell along with all the Israeli soldiers that got massacred as they saw righteously deserved it free Palestine!!!!üáµüá∏üáµüá∏
Unlikely, a secondary explosion of that size would need to be a hell of a lot of propane &amp; wouldn't there be a bigger fireball if it was propane?
Hamas have played the fuck around card.... Israel Uno reversed them with the find out card
They do in most places, but it's better not to rely on it.
Israel is a terror organization
No, fuck the fake followers who pervert Allah and Jihad religion as excuses for terrorism. Fuck terrorists
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ib6TC0JVfi8
No it doesint, I've agreed with you on that regard. Maybe instead of assuming, my point after a single sentence try a reading comprehension class.Point: The war is bad regardless. But you can't completely fault the Palestinians as Isreal has also been doing horrendous acts. Both countries and people should be delt with.To a certain extend the Palestinians deserve to defend themselves. They've jumped past that into attacking civilians in horrid ways. Just as Israeli soldiers have been doing aswell. But both sides have taken things to an extreme.
Right??? Something so hot about watching him save her.
I think the better analogy would be if some Native Americans rose up against the people and government who took their land, slaughtered their people and forced them to the margins of society.   Sound familiar?   They would be treated the same as Palestinians and while the NA would have the moral high ground in a way the terrorist do not, they would, rightfully, be annihilated.
These is usually and should be an AAD in the rig. It's an Automatic Actuation Device that will pop the reserve if you hit a certain altitude at a certain speed. It's still a danger though as if you are unconscious you can't control your landing of course and if you aren't in a stable position when the reserve pops you can get tangled in the lines and what not.
Yeah, I honestly don‚Äôt really care TBH (about downvotes). And thank you - it is true. Literally just doing the same thing over and over and over again. And what? In the name of religion? Because of land? We will never evolve if we can‚Äôt learn from our own stupidity. It‚Äôs very frustrating and disheartening.
And then get captured.. then be captured on a nasty comedown. I‚Äôm not making fun either - I‚Äôm being very serious.
It takes more faith to believe in science than God. That must make you a hypocrite
He's got more intelligence than you if that is your response. He took the time to articulate a good argument. Your just throwing sticks
Everyone wants to blame God when bad things happen, God isn't the problem WE ARE. If you want to blame someone blame the devil.. don't be so dense

Eh, Americans all over the place call the Russians orcs and make fun of them. This is reality
She should probably just go tell them herself, in person.
free Palestine
This is so fake. Please.
I think we can do better without the whole region (not talking about people just all the landmarks). I like jews, Muslims and Christians but the history there fucks the whole planet constantly, everyone gets far warning then boom reset!
cartel in Mexico did the same thing to me, pants down zip tied left my white ass is the hot sun for hoirs, never been burnt like that in my life. but didn't get butt fucked so I call it a win!
If you COULD care less, that means you currently care a lot about it.
they must has missed the last 4 john wicks.
Who said that
Make Gaza Israel‚Äôs parking lot
Or propane tanks.
Not so funny now is it Palestine?
Oh what do you know m4 rifles
The fact that this is a real quote and a real question makes me want to cry, Noah get the boat indeed
This is actually horrid.I wish something could be done so these people didn't exist...
And tell us exactly why the air strikes were happening. Maybe it was due to hamas using civilian buildings for military purposes. It seems to be common trait of terrorist organisations. Using their own civilians as effectively meat shields knowing that if Israel reacts, they can simply say they‚Äôre e killing innocent people. Let‚Äôs compare that to what‚Äôs just happened. They targeted a music festival butchering hundreds of people. Absolutely no military importance. Pure murderKarma is a bitch. Isreal will make sure of that.
She sadly probably is dead and got raped
so Ukrainians are aloo terrorists?
I lived there all my life
Wipe Gaza off the map.
The wars are thanks to bankers.  Follow the money.
Interesting thought.. whether it's true or not, we can agree people are brainwashed, and those who cheer in the western and other NATO countries seem to be uneducated whats really happening. I think who support this disgusting attack need to wake up, if this was happening in their own backyard it would be different. Those that hold a Palestine flag should go to the Gaza strip for a year. Perhaps I'm brainwashed for my western ideology, morally these attacks look evil to me.
It was never Palestinian land‚Ä¶ Jews in Israel has origins since biblical times
You may have a point there are founds being ‚Äúfreed‚Äù but non of it has been spent( the money for humanitarian aid) so Iran would still need to put the money. As of the moment of posting there is no evidence to prove your claim. What if folks say isn‚Äôt it a coincidence that the US doesn‚Äôt have a speaker and now Israel is in a conflict. This would be a good time to attack because the US Israel‚Äôs biggest ally can‚Äôt really help like they did at the for front with Ukrainian. Why? No speaker. Nothing gets passed. These claims do nothing but help the divide. So what if politicians spread misinformation and division. Should you then engage in the same ? The DIP is no good.

War is not something to laugh at
They killed 11 Americans so far and kidnapped more
Doesn't justify the massacreing of women and children in the thousands. The hundreds of r*pes and kidnappings. What about the 100 dead foreigners who had nothing to do with the conflict? Shooting people running away... hanging, r*pings, and mutilating soldiers who are surrendering. Machine gunning families fleeing from their homes.
funny how its account is now deleted, however "Gaza fights for freedom" by killing innocent citizens raping and killing women and children is not freedom, its terrorism.
Why not collect your turbin and your goat and make your way to palastine.
Oh sorry
Have you ever been to isreal or "Palestine"
You do know hamas and your average Palestinian are not the same. What you are talking about is mass genocide of innocent people because of terrorist actions..hmmmm
Muslims steal land all across the globe by the second but no other religion can exist in the middle east, it's easy to call Israel and the west racist, but go try raise a family and build a church in Iran let's see what happens
Did you not read the part where I said hamas were evil and deserved to die? You should go back to my replies and try reading instead of making stuff up.....you seem to be a zionist because you defend the actions of Israel, you haven't talked about even one of my points which means your stupid or you know your wrong, nothing else....
Or maybe it's because every single day the iron Dome stops innocent people dying? If you were from Israel would you put up with the fact everyday could be your last due to terrorists firing missiles over your head? The worst people in all of this are the ones supplying terrorists with weapons that's what puts Palestine at risk
$$$
This video is a good starting point but keep in mind it's very generalized.  It glosses over the fact that the formation of Israel was most likely a British strategy to gain more control over the suez canal.
Found the incel neckbeard
My bad.  You are right.  You said mother is raped.  I‚Äôm not a Zionist and I never said the Israelis hands are clean here.   You seem to do an awful lot of justifying talk. My stance is that Hamas is a bunch of murderers full stop.   And there is no justification for what they have done.
Not a surprise coming from the Neanderthal bridge link between humans and pond life
Sure the land was originally Jewish go read a book
They are all just stupid. They are all low intellect people, they don't know the consequences and such. They are living in stone age
While I don't doubt some Russians cheeres Americans deaths, this looks like bad photoshop. Nothing is parallel.
Good riddance
Fair enough so it's retaliation and now they're grabbing women and children and chanting god is great it's not going to end well for them. But what do I know
Sympathizers join Gaza
No I will watch the IDF level Gaza until they're all swimming with the fish
Your responses in the comment section seems to be more balanced than your actual post and don't forget that the title doesn't mention Hamas needs to change. After explaining yourself in the comments I don't totally agree with you but I understand and respect your point.
Damn, you racist as fuck.
Soon to be Gaza fields
It's just funny how they blame him, but never any reason or evidence behind  it.
They should flatten Gaza up and plant a Forrest
Note the secondary explosion s. Hitting arms caches.
Israel is the US's pitbull in the middle east and gives the US a strategic advantage. Not to mentioned, our cultures are more in-line contrasting the more extreme religious views in the middle east.
This doesn't stick it's silly and ridiculous. Muslims in Nigeria think the entire geographical area of the land known as Nigeria belongs to them.
Why are people saying he got hit? He stepped on the grass and broke his ankle. What kind of bones this dude have?
See this is why good everyday citizens need firearms
Fake news
Lol another religion war
In previous posts of this video it was reported she was.
Amazing save.
American Christian facts what to force what they believe is the literal apocalypse from the bible.
Ah shit they drive like they dive apparently.
Fuck this format. Just play the video. Straight dope.
There will be no end until we rid the world of this evil. It‚Äôs obvious this isn‚Äôt anything other than evil. The blame fall on parents of the world to keep hate out of our hearts and our children‚Äôs hearts. Jesus said this day would come if we didn‚Äôt love all. Love conquers evil.Oh and so does a laser guided bomb, or a U.S. Marine.
Talking to the demon whisperer the name checks out
If you looked at this conflict through the lense of a Bible scholar your opinions might change a bit
You clearly don't read your bible
That land was promised to them by God since the beginning of time. You want to be the enemy of God's chosen people be my guest there is plenty of room for you in the lake of fire
Tell that to Hamas.  Who else put these people in harms way.
You both are dumb as fuck.
DUMB RELIGIOIS ZEALOTS ON BOTH SIDES.
I've SEEN Israeli soldiers sniping children who were doing nothing. Open your eyes. Drop your religion and think.
You have fallen victim to the same hate that consumes some of them. Grow up in Russia and I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd think differently about their situation. I don‚Äôt support them but I understand that not every Russian is their government and we are probably more like them than we imagine.
It‚Äôs too late. They‚Äôve released the flying monkeys!
I was downvoted for pointing out both sides are shit.
Now I‚Äôm not super well versed in the history of all this but I believe Israel has offered many opportunities for peace but hamas always says nope. I can call a spade a spade.. if an Israeli extremest went and did what hamas did to innocent Palestine children I would feel the same way. It‚Äôs horrible. And if any person celebrated that I would say that person is a terrible human being. I don‚Äôt know what you expect Israel to do in this situation with what has gone down‚Ä¶ and i think hamas knew there would be major retaliation which included many civilian deaths of their own people and they don‚Äôt care. They don‚Äôt have any value on human life. That‚Äôs why terrorists are so dangerous
Israel is just fine.  It's Palestinians that need to change.  Try modelling Israel as a state.
News alert - Hamas knew this would happen.  Anything that happens to civilians is the responsibility of Hamas.  Israel can proceed with a clear conscience.
was she unconscious?
Always will be
That little child has probably been raped to death by the pigs!
Well yea sorta I don't think the world is literally ending per say but yea
Palestine is a freaking region, not a country and for Muslims to claim the whole region has always been theirs is complete revisionist bullshit.
I'm not comparing hamas to all of Israel, I'm not even talking about Israelis, 90% of them are cool dudes, normal people, but 10% of them are zionist extremist and the government is evil, they kill and oppress Muslims, and call Muslims dogs and animals and treat them poorly then wonder why hamas wants revenge against them, my  main point is this, listen good.....Violence begets violence.The cycle of hatred doesn't end unless someone in the cycle decides to be the better person and turn the cheek.Peace not War dude.
Russians are spineless nuclear terrorists themselves, did you expect anything less? They want to end all life on earth including themselves lmao ü§£

I'm not educated enough on the history between isreal and palestine but the fact that people are happy innocents are dying isn't justifiable
All I see is mass shooter terrorists who were told to kill innocent people by the nuclear terrorist state of Iran and its Allie‚Äôs the nuclear terrorist state of Russia. You ignore bigger pictures. And small pictures. Well, you are just ignorant all around. Doesn‚Äôt matter that isreal is trash and terrorizes Palestine, Hamas stooped to their level but are far more evil with every step therefore becoming the bad guys in the eyes of the rest of the world. They sealed their own fate when they were raping and murdering innocent people at that festival. On the streets. In the homes of families. How ignorant can you be? Can you not see things in an objective manner? Or does god tell you otherwise. Just like how despite america being evil, Russia is the bad guy for threatening to end all life on earth by starting global thermal nuclear war. Incapable of critical thinking are we?
Why would the normal person know or care about this? What makes OP an idiot?
I don‚Äôt think western media is white supremes. Liberal bought American  social media brainwashed America to hate white people. Even the low iq white people hate white people now. Had to stop watching after they switched topics to racism in a different country across the globe
Cuse your dumb and don't pay attention. Use your head. Maybe think for once and you'll understand but your dumb af
You can‚Äôt compare a terrorist organization to all of Israel
Your dumb Easter boy
Your dumb
............................I know.............I said that.......I said they should die.......you should read more.....
I never said grandma got raped or that the government put out a official sanction to do that I can provide multiple articles of the Israeli government doing shady things such as stealing land, employing jewish civilians to harass Muslim citizens as they travel freely, jewish police misconduct and abuse and alt right jewish groups attacking Muslims Christians and foreigners. That's not hard that's a handful of news and video links but I'm not spending 30 mins putting that together for you not to watch it and play the smart ass who puts words in my mouth you obviously are a zionist and I don't deal with people like that who don't want to listen.
Jewish people are also very influential in American politics. They are highly represented in politics and other institutions.
Reality is often cruel.
Pride, envy, selfishness, hatred, the Devil is working very hard in the Middle East, and God's prophecies will be fulfilled. Read Revelations and let the spirit of truth reveal that the world is slowly dying.
You my friend are a idiot!
Jews and zionists? No. Right wing extremists who have genocided more than anyone and not just genocided but have done even worse things and expected the child they killed the whole family of not to get revenge? Yes.I know more of their crimes than most of the population of earth, if there was actually a need to compare who has done more bad things in the conflict, i'd say it was Israel, but not the jews, they never have done anything wrong (fuck extremists tho)
You‚Äôre a victim of western propaganda. Watch the documentary Gaza Fights For Freedom. This is a matter of genocide.
Looking for it too. Friends are saying there‚Äôs a video. Any news?
Hamas centers all their military operations throughout civilian areas including under hospitals. They clearly do this intentionally. They have no regard for human life
If this is propaganda then your head is stuck so far up you're own ass you can snell your own breathe.
Hamas are literal terrorists!!
Hey look found a bot
Do you really support isreal ??Do you side with the invader not the defender ??So it's ok for you if some one invaded you and when you try to fight back you are the one who is called a terrorist?
Learn the history of Gaza. It is a CONCENTRATION CAMP. An open air PRISON. Why are you here supporting Nazis?
Came here to this sub for exactly this video.  Thanks for posting it from an American.  It‚Äôs nice to fully understand what‚Äôs going on now I have some clarity.
That‚Äôs what‚Äôs so fucked up! You‚Äôd be legit trippin‚Äô balls or peaking and next minute you have terrorists landing using paragliders and gunning you down. Terrifying.
Professional tennis player Jaime Sommers was critically injured in a skydiving accident and we all know how that turned out.
The money has in fact not been spent on Hamas funding you're accurate there. But what people on the left don't realize, or choose to ignore, and what people on the right can't seem to articulate while arguing (I imagine the dumber ones) is this...While the 6 billion in unfrozen assets can only be used in humanitarian expenses and is still in a bank in Qatar, that frees up 6 billion in Iranian assets that would have been needed to cover those frozen assets. And you better believe that funding Hamas and other nefarious actions is exactly where they're own money has gone and will continue to go now that we've unfrozen that 6 billion.Our government has created such a divide between the parties and our population that not many people actually think anymore. We're all just dying to prove each other wrong. Dying to argue.
The video linked above is excellent for anyone who isn't sure where this all started.  Thank you
Doesn‚Äôt matter what‚Äôs going on innocent children and people don‚Äôt deserve to be killed
Ok.     Lot to unpack here.  So can you cite me a few sources of the Israeli government sanctioning pissing on raping grandma etc?You have made the statement so I assume you can support it.  Take your time.   I will wait
Are Israeli people allowed to own guns like Americans?
It might not fair to blame him for everything as it appears he doesn't know what he is doing and where he is sometimes. But he is the person sitting in the chair, who else to blame?
That's one way around a denial for a vacation!
Thats the cruelest thing you can ever tell a person tbf.
Just observant
Thank you
Yeah its ashame if you think the definition of a prison is only the ones with bars and judicial sentences. The term prison is more general than that.I also see thats the only part you focused on. Nothing wrong with the water limiting/poisoning, apartheid, and them not belonging there in the first place part?
Yeah this was 10 years ago now, I did it in September then the season ended and I never got back into it the following year. After 7 months of winter and not jumping I wasn't confident enough without doing the course again. Been thinking about getting back into it every year since but haven't:(
I don't know why you're getting down voted. Nothing you said is untrue or controversial. Truth hurts I guess.
Yes. Also, the US knows that since Israel is the only democracy, they have to protect them. If the US isn‚Äôt strong enough to protect them, all lunatics of the Middle East with bombs galore will have no fear

As an atheist who lives in turkey, I don't much love islam myself. But I can't say they're worst because of muslims. There are socialist(alevi), liberal(quran only/modernist)and even pantheist pacifist(tasavvufi) readings of islam as well. In middle east USA destroyed the secular arabs since they tend to support soviets. This is why there's isis and other shit salafi terror organizations exist today. Did tou know Usame bin laden trained by americans and his brother was founded the first middle eastern petrol company with the fucking Bush!?
Hamas has woken King David and it's time to kill Galiath. You can blame Iran and Russia for all the weapons Hamas used. Putin has more blood on his hands. It's time to nuke Iran.

Blaming it on Biden is always the way. They blame him for everything they possibly can. Then love to tell how Trump would have never let this happen. GTFO with that bullshit!
I'm not sure how it is for other people, I do remember it all but I was basically paralyzed, unable to function. The instructors had a go pro on and I'm smiling the whole time so it's not out of terror. I had to do a couple drills, like test pulls of my shoot and I wasn't doing those. And eventually we hit our altitude to pull the shoot and I was a deer in the headlights so they pulled it for me. The next jump was normal and I continued the course and ended up doing 30 more solo jumps that month.
The video is very 1 sided and doesn‚Äôt really cover a lot of what led to the current situation. Vox put together a video that is just the facts. Once you know all the history, I think it‚Äôs pretty clear why a militant group like Hamas was able to gain power in Gaza. Doesn‚Äôt mean what Hamas did is right, in fact quite the opposite. Any killing of civilians is reprehensible and I think it is fair to call Hamas all kinds of names. But to say this was completely unprovoked is also VERY misleading.

My worst nightmare comes true.
In Wisconsin 8 hr class jump solo you crawl out of the plane stand on the wheel landing plate . Guy on each side but jump solo 1 guy a head of you 1 after. I blanked for about a few secs came to, free falling, the jump master  stops in front of me does the eye check and thumbs up . Pulled my own cord. Awesome ! Oh and that taking while falling in movies is total bs.
Why did she keep twisting her body so she kept spinning though lmao
It wasn't our money
Blow back is never pretty
Sensory overload , adrenaline..
What does held onto the pull mean?
What causes the blackout?
Dude, I never said anything about supporting Israel, I wasn‚Äôt even trying to insinuate that they deserve it, but I understand how it could appear that way. I just meant that the religion of Islam is a disease in general, as in the oppression and terrorism and etc in the name of religionTLDR, I didn‚Äôt mean it that way
I heard as well, someone said ‚Äúsame boots in the video‚Äù but it seems this old video the girl has black ankle boots too. I would really be devastated if it‚Äôs true. Her fathers words had me sobbing
The moment I saw your name ƒ± feared you'll defend israel to death haha. It's weird to seeing 100 indian spawned whenever something bad about muslims happens. I can understand you guys hate pakistanis, I don't like them too lol. But it's weird afterall
They also provided protection to all the German scientist, America dose what benefits America selling weapons waging war for profit to think they care about democracy in the Middle East is cute they always play both sides and make the most money
People who don't want to live a long life.
Absolutely. 99% of people who support Palestine do not support Hamas. It is a terrorist group. It is evil. It isn‚Äôt good for its own people. It does want to genocide Jews. The only reason Palestinians put any support behind them is because they don‚Äôt really have many other options, nobody else is really coming to bat for them and laying down and taking it from Israel hasnt made things better in the past, so they have to by default turn to the only entity that seemingly is doing SOMETHING, and because of that Hamas ends up being able to push a narrative to the Palestinian people. This is largely a leadership issue. But obviously the situation has created cultural shifts that have bled into the populations and altered how they view the other side. Unfortunately it‚Äôs not a one side issue where if you remove one king from the chess board then the game is resolved. If Israel were to surrender (it never would and there‚Äôs no situation where Hamas can make them) then Hamas would attempt a genocide on the Israelis. If Palestine where to surrender (or be completely wiped out, both strong possibilities right now), then Israel would all but absorb the small portion of territory Palestine still has left and functionally drive their people out, if not subject them to an even harsher apartheid state than they‚Äôre already in. Basically, things get worse if either side wins. It‚Äôs either some form of mutual agreement or the suffering grows so great that it leads to the genocide of the losing side.
Yeah, that‚Äôs not it but you‚Äôre horrible for rebranding it
This video is an old video. Venezuelan vigilante justice. Her and some men robbed and murdered a store owner. They caught her and set her on fire. She was 16.
You ever try to explain to people that believe in this stuff that if they were able to capture video, record sitings, take samples, and analyze data gathered by what they thought were paranormal, it would no longer be paranormal?In other words, if you can use scientific tools to measure and experience a phenomenon, then it's clearly part of the physical world.
Yes, I‚Äôll stand still. Exhibit A: https://reddit.com/r/PublicFreakout/s/1f5vXpVbht
Exactly! It has nothing to do with USA, Biden, Dems vs Republicans. So stupid, just looking for someone to blame, &amp; blaming our own government for things that happening around the world. Putin invaded Ukraine, it's Biden's fault?  How stupid is this? How about Israelis have been molesting Palestinians for decades &amp; they just had enough.
Cheering for civilian casualties against any side is when we lose our humanity.
Just blame The trader of the free world‚Äù  for everything you all are talking about. Nobody is wrong if the USA is involved. Owned Joe is the thought, the catalyst, the gasoline, the dynamite, and the destruction of all good. He doesn‚Äôt get burned because he‚Äôs the Tin Man. I live in the USA and this doesn‚Äôt touch the things I want to say.
Because allah bad
I don‚Äôt think so
Appears so. Here‚Äôs the link

   Okay, then support communist palestine groups?    Israel even pour cement to their water sources and more and you're waiting people to be sivil. Oh those monsters, why didn't they  just post #freepalestine and cancel netanyahu?   Gazze is a fucking modern version of nazi ghettos.  Also not shooting civilians is impossible. Everywhere in that region filled with people.
I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre indiscriminately bombing like Hamas throws rockets. They‚Äôre dropping bombs on targets and homes of Hamas leaders, buildings know to be weapons caches, earlier they were bombing sites suspected to be areas where tunnels are, etc. you‚Äôre drawing a false equivalence based on nothing. OP is CNN‚Äôs fucking hero
Also, stupid &amp; ignorant!
Here is a thought for the Republicans. Iran has been giving Putin free Shahed drones? Iran has been selling their weapons all over the world, not just Russia. Putin paid top dollars for those drones &amp; various weapons that Russia has been dropping on Ukraine are from Iran.
No. I have repeatedly stated Hamas is evil and needs to be destroyed. But that doesn‚Äôt change that fact that using children as human shields doesn‚Äôt work for propaganda unless the other side is willing to shoot a child being used as a human shield. Imagine you‚Äôre a cop in New York. Some lunatic with a gun takes a 5 year old kid as a hostage and stands behind him. If this lunatic has already killed two cops and is willing to kill more who try to stop him, does it suddenly give the cops the go ahead to riddle the 5 year old with bullets to kill the hostage taker? Does that change if the hostage taker and the child are both foreigners? Israel has expressed a blatant disregard for the lives of Palestinians, children included. And as we saw with America, when a major military power treats a population inhumanly and kills civilians en masse including children, it WILL be used as propaganda because why the fuck would you NOT? America used 9/11 as propaganda to fuel the war in the Middle East, and Pearl Harbor as propaganda to fuel efforts to join WW2. Israel‚Äôs treatment of Palestine is why Palestinians look to Hamas for answers, and Israel (much like America in the Middle East) is doing a ‚Äúsolution‚Äù that works to exasperate the problem they‚Äôre trying to solve. We saw it for the last 20 years, killing a bunch of kids to kill some terrorists just ends up turning the kids you didn‚Äôt kill into more terrorists than you managed to kill. Israel has shown zero interest in addressing the root of why Hamas even exists (spoiler alert, Israel played a very large direct role in its creation) in the first place to be able to shoot rockets.
Likud didn't come to power until the late 1970s. Before that it was various center left and social democracy parties.There was a whole tit for tat going on in the 60s with fedayeen attacks and IDF reprisals.Since the War of Independence, the Arabs vowed to wipe out the Jewish State. Can you really blame the Jews for saying never again?
I hear ya!
Our president was having a cookout ignoring what‚Äôs happening on his watch.
Fuck Allah! And fuck Jihad!
Pile up the Arabs and let the birds feast.
Republicans also think Biden also burned down Lahaina in Maui too. First, they said it was Oprah, when Biden was preparing to come to visit Lahaina, the Republicans in Hawaii said don't come, because he started the fire. Republicans will use any event in the world, &amp; blame Biden administration. Putin blamed Biden for his invasion of Ukraine. Next, we will see these Republicans will be saying Biden killed Jesus! PUTIN GETS Shahed DRONES from Iran FOR FREE?@!#$ Putin paid hundreds of billions for them, with the gas/oil money he sold to EU for decades.
I don't WANT to know why it is ok to brutally kill innocent civilians and share the video on the internet so that certain 'people' (probably like you) can get high. If you want your children to live stop supporting  terrorists and stop using hospitals and schools as the base of terrorist operations.
If you feel that way about Israel then you must feel that way about America. You only have the freedoms you have right now because soldiers are out killing combatants, women, children, and innocent men. In the Iraq war will killed over a quarter million civilians. That‚Äôs just in Iraq america is the worlds largest country in the buisness of taking lives. Let‚Äôs talk about that you wanna?
Watch it
Shitty propaganda! How about the Israelis have been molesting Palestine economy for decades. Israel has been stealing Palestinians land, block water to Palestinians towns &amp; villages, not allowing them to fish on their own ocean, take away their mineral rights, not allowing them to mine their own oil on their own territories, killing innocent children, &amp; civilians daily. But there were no coverages on this. Now the Israels are crying atrocities what Palestinians are doing what they have been doing to the Palestinians for decades. When you pushed people to desperation, desperate people will do desperate things to free themselves from bondage. Now the world start seeing years of abuse &amp; bully can do to these people.
SpongeBob: ‚Äú5 minutes later‚Äù
Could you imagine if Mexico did this on U.S. soil... I'm actually happy they're are our neighbors at this point. Extremely hard working and have delicious food.
Gervais made a great point:Destroy every religious text and all traces of all religions, then do the same for all science books and research. In 1000 years, the science books would return exactly as they are now. The religious texts would be gone for good. Religion is made up bullshit and is a cancer on society.
I believe there is consistent, but not overwhelming support for Jews.  Persecution and all.  I also believe that a majority of Americans don‚Äôt trust Muslims and have a hard on to see some get waxed right now.  No matter how oppressive Israel has been to Palestine
It sounds like Iran was involved and now Hezbollah getting in the mix. Totally destabilizes the region with our long term ally. Plus Americans were definitely killed and taken hostage.
i'd fall in love tbh
‚ÄúThe military is getting sent over there or something‚Äù ffs
Ackshually, 6 billion like a week ago.
You're right they can tell if a pidegeon or dog gets close to the border you're gonna say multiple groups of armed men went unnoticed to the point of making it into nearby cities and not one alert ...not a single one at all. They shoot kids that throw rocks across a line like come on now
Umm 11 Americans died. Some have been taken hostage. If you come to reddit to get your news then...
I held my breath through most of that video. Even knowing she survived by the title, I was terrified for her.
BS what justify for Israelis for decades of dominating &amp; molesting Palestinians economy, killing innocent Palestinians, taking away their lands, mineral rights, food supplies, water, not allowing them to fish on their own ocean front, &amp; limiting their electricity uses. Nothing justified kidnapping &amp; killing innocent, you are right about that. But you must look at what Israel did to escalate to this level. Israel is not innocent. For decades Israelis have been killing innocent Palestinians, but there were no news coverages, it all a hush, hush operations. Don't be tricked to think that Irael is innocent. Israel has been provoking Palestinians for decades.
I heard one reason was that Israel and Saudi were close to an agreement on peace, trade, etc.  Iran hates Saudi and vice versa.  This essentially stonewalled the finalization of that deal and destabilized the region to level not seen in decades.
Parasailing can be learned on YouTube
I wonder how many of them haven‚Äôt been killed
I appreciate your passion.  Is it fair to say that leadership and culture of both Israelis and Palestinians are really fucking over their populations?
So like...you find that an appropriate military tactic?
You live under a rock bro?
You‚Äôre doing a lot of whataboutism, and you‚Äôre also a fuckjn idiot
Probably the most comprehensive, mature take I've seen  in a while.  I don't understand how so many people forget that it's OK to say that two sides of a conflict can both be wrong.  Israel is doing wrong things.  Hamas is doing wrong things.  Innocents pay the price and the world watches, or worse, supports one side over the other due to political leanings and interests.

You sound like a infamous world leader of the 1930's.....shameful
Oh my God
"when you sleep in Israel and wake up in Palestine..."
Because we are constantly being distracted by things on the other side of the world so we ignore things in our backyard.
Holy shit spell check my guy.
She's weak
But those threads.... They are otakus.... Wtf...
Or they just too fucking stupid to realize that iran pays them to fight a proxy war against Israel because iran doesn‚Äôt give a fuck about Palestinians either. They pay hamas to attack Israel knowing full well Israel will attack Gaza. And these people are too dumb to know they‚Äôre being used.
BIDEN GAVE HAMAS  275 MILLION   JUST  2 YEARS AGO  SO NO WONDER THEY HAVE WEPONS TO KILL THE JEWS
You seem like a deep thinker.
WHEN U RAPE AND KILL CHILDREN AND WOAMN   YOUR A TERRORIST
‚ÄúMaybe they can drink my grandson pee, it‚Äôs very clean‚Äù
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm saying - you know there were people trippin balls. I can‚Äôt even imagine.
Isreal is the only democracy in the Middle East. In WW2 Hitler killed millions of Jews and they tried to escape and create a new home. The USA promised to provide protection to them and has tried to ever since.
She held on for dear life the second time lol
History repeating itself for the millionth time. This is what the world does - war. Apparently, nothing is learned.
Israel and america have deep roots going right back to Israels inception after WW2.  Israel is one of the largest buyers of american weapons.  Israel is far and away, americas strongest ally in the middle east.Edit:  I am not american or israeli and know very little... the relationship is deep and complex... clearly more nuanced than ive stated above.  But those are the broad strokes, I think.
*Defense from israeli terrorism and massacare of innocents
Bunch of monkeys screaming allah akbar . Kill em all.
Get the women and children out, leave the military aged men in. And carpet bomb the shit out of it.
Remember when they put "love" messages on missiles aimed at Palestinians?
Get the women and children out and just carpet bomb it with all the military aged men still inside.
Storing weapons there is also a war crime.
Day by day oppression, I live in the US, and even though it's a fucked place to live, I've also traveled all over the planet and I have seen that I am blessed and have it so good even thou US is pretty bad,and If my government did to me what the Israeli government did to the muslims i would wage war in a heartbeat, now i wouldnt rape and murder women and childern, but im not sticking up for hamas, im saying Israel has contributed to this death cycle through their oppression, if you are being honest and looking at all angles, Israel is also bad, they have killed innocents by the thousands, created an actual 2nd class citizens with Muslims, and are even starting to attack chirstians, now most Israelis are cool people but it's always the fringe that set an example, and the Israeli government has not cracked down on the alt right groups, I'm not defending hamas brother, I'm calling out the other side, they are both evil, and this will never stop until both sides stop the evil, we all know hamas is evil, many of us don't even know Israel is evil, that's my point.
its all about the money
I thought my work deadlines were harsh
That would be a warcrime
Most of them probably thought it was part of the show. How horrifying.
Yeah shockingly enough it does make good propaganda to show your enemy willingly and frequently mass killing children and repeatedly blowing up critical infrastructure that leads to further suffering and death for hundreds of thousands of civilians. Who would have guessed?
Military intervention is a lot different then massacring and raping civilian population. when has Israel done anything close to that disgusting stuff??  Sit down brother.
Can confirm, I never pulled my chute I blacked out haha. But got it the next time.
Gaza = rock quarry!!!
I just gotta say one thing is that the traditional Jewish person does not believe that Jesus was god in human form. Jesus preached the exact opposite of what Israel does. Jesus preached about giving all of you possessions to the needy. The bad part is that gods word has be perverted and there are so many people that are driven by hatred and anger.
Hello, FBI?This shit right here.
Yes the Israeli bombs are guided. They know the yield area of damage. The Palestinians (just Hamas) are firing low income rockets random targets no idea where they gonna go. Hell some landed in Gaza. They have been fighting for thousands of years. It‚Äôs in their dna
Right!!!!???
Now listen to this ;https://youtu.be/DfR6S_2lj_U?si=S8QcsKTCWTYOlmjH
I guess if you're in Lebanon, this is the really the only thing going for them.
It‚Äôs cute that you basically ignored everything I said. So I guess a modern military power doing mass killing, segregation, unfairly claiming land, brutal policing, forced relocation, trapping populations in a confined area under harsh conditions, preventing escape, and siphoning resources, against a weak impoverished minority, is what ‚ÄúIsrael has never tried to genocide anyone‚Äù looks like to you? Yeah, sure dude, you‚Äôre being super genuine and honest here I can tell.
Not in a cave.  Been in a rocket attack. It‚Äôs not fun.
Yes, I would. Compound fractures are really dangerous, and with the risk of infection, potentially life-threatening.
'held onto the pull'? What does this mean?
You‚Äôre right but the people who only get their information from the news and not actual history books or historical text will say Israel good Palestine bad unfortunately and they will then hurl insults your way ‚Ä¶ but i say again‚Ä¶. You are right
Israel isn‚Äôt depriving 500,000 Palestinian civilians of clean water because Hamas has rockets. Israel isn‚Äôt gunning down peaceful protestors by the thousands because it‚Äôs defending itself. Israel isn‚Äôt allowing its citizens to steal family homes from Palestinian families because it‚Äôs afraid for its future. If Palestine threw their weapons into the sea there would also be no more Palestine. Sometime look at the territory map of Palestine over the years and see how big it used to be compared to now. Again, you‚Äôre talking about an impoverished nation that‚Äôs population is literally 43% children whose most advanced military technology is cobbled together rockets that Israel has an active counter to, versus a nuclear armed modern country with an organized standing military supplied and funded by the most powerful military superpower in the world. Palestine surrenders and then what? They‚Äôre still stuck in an open air concentration camp. Israel still keeps them trapped in their country. Israel still controls the borders and seas. Israel still siphons their water supplies. Israel still segregates their roads. Israel still allows its citizens to kick Palestinian families onto the streets. None of that changes if Palestine surrenders, because this is shit Israel has been doing for decades regardless of if it‚Äôs a time of hostility or a time of peace. Israel wants to take over and/or wipe out Palestine. It‚Äôs a common belief among Israeli citizens that Palestine needs to be cleansed. Genocidal rhetoric is very common in Israel, it‚Äôs just you only ever hear about the genocidal rhetoric of Palestinians because it‚Äôs more narratively convenient to categorize the brown Muslims as genocidal maniacs as if they aren‚Äôt the ones CURRENTLY BEING GENOCIDED. Hamas is evil. But it‚Äôs not the aggressor, it‚Äôs not the one in control, it‚Äôs not the most dangerous one in the room, it‚Äôs not the most powerful. Hamas cannot take over Israel, its physically impossible. Israel CAN take over Palestine though. And currently that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs been doing for decades.
Also Hamas is Palestine, as Hamas is Iran, as Iran is Al-Queda. It's all one group of depraved people following a barbaric religion they use to justify waging holy war on any they see beneath them. Israel has never tried to Genocide anyone, these group actively pray to their gods that they hope they can genocide Israel.
Where can I watch these Israeli war videos outside Reddit?
Palestinians actively use schools, hospitals, and children as shields so they can slap a nice little propaganda piece out if Israel ever retaliates
Jesus is king
At this time, the greatest, most advanced army in the world, instead of engaging the infiltrators unleashing hell, are indiscriminately lobbing massive ordinance into an area full of non-combatants and people of all ages. They have cut everything from their lives. And you support that?For 75 years the world has been deaf and immune to laws which itself erected when the Palestinians are routinely brutalized.This act of Hamas is a desperate yet brave act of individuals who refuse to give up their freedom. They realized they are being systematically killed and it's only a matter of time before they too are exterminated. So why not go down fighting? Give them a taste of their own medicine.You support this action of Zionists? Gaza and Zionist relations were that of a barrel full of fish and a man with a shotgun.The fish are just trying to be free. This is support for the bravery of those fish to stand determined against a man with the shotgun who respects no boundaries, follows no law and is morally bankrupt.Where do your morals lie, OP?
ThisüëÜüèªüëÜüèª
"Irrational Faith?" All faith is irrational, thats why its called faith. I beleive in $Deity as much as I believe in the easter bunny but I have to see that community is organized around religion and that reminding people to respect one another and help one another is not a bad thing. Of course usurpers will manipulate these traditions to benefit themselves but thats true of every institution. People still believe in god long after god has stopped believing in them.
This is Reddit. You came in hot. WTF are you expecting?
Why do people downvote a fact?!!! Truth hurts?
Is that all you could say? Instead of actually providing a meaningful argument?
You need to ask yourself "why" they do what they do.
I've heard this quote- What do you think of it--If Hamas threw their weapons into the sea, there would be no more war.If Israel threw their weapons into the sea, there would be no more Israel.
Sir, this is a Wendy‚Äôs.
Wow, that comment was really helpful, providing huge evidence that my facts were completely not true, and i'm truly unable to respond to your evidence
They can‚Äôt leave the Gaza Strip.  It‚Äôs being fired upon.  Walk or run?‚Ä¶. No airport‚Ä¶.  You sound like a C- kinda  guy.
Nothing can justify what Hamas has done to these civilians.
Your post is worth less since its already proven not to be true.Stop trying to feed hoax news into the world.
‚ÄúIsrael has done some bad moves but Hamas and Palestinians are a different kind of beast‚Äù. Really? Has Palestine sabotaged Israel‚Äôs water supplies, leading to hundreds of thousands of impoverished people without access to clean water? Is Palestine currently siphoning off vital clean water supplies in Israel and redirecting them into Palestine? Has Palestine imposed a blockade onto Israel? Does Palestine control the seas outside of Israel and prevent Israelis from going more than a few nautical miles off shore under threat of being blown up by warships? Does Palestine segregate Israeli roads? Does Palestine control the border around Israel and regularly shoot Israelis that get too close to it even in their own country? Do Palestinians regularly wander into Israel and claim occupied houses for their own, kicking out impoverished Israeli families onto the streets, with the backing of the Palestinian military? Does Palestine have a modernized military and organized standing military that it regularly uses to subjugate the whole of Israel? Does Palestine currently have access to nuclear weapons? Does Palestine currently have the explicit unconditional backing of the most economically and militarily powerful country in the world? In the last spout of violence a few years ago Israel killed 60 times as many children as Palestine did, and 6 times as many Palestinian CHILDREN as Palestine killed Israelis total, (Israel killed 220+ Palestinians 60 of which were children, Palestine killed 10 Israelis of which 1 was a child). At one point Palestine firebombed a field which didn‚Äôt even injure anyone let alone kill any Israelis, and the response was Israel bombing a public center and killing over a dozen civilians including 8 children. About 50% of Israeli youth believe Palestinians should not have the right to vote. It is a frequent discussed stance among Israelis to wipe out the Palestinians. And unlike the Palestinians who can‚Äôt, literally CAN‚ÄôT, genocide or take over Israel, Israel CAN and IS doing that to Palestine. Yeah genocidal rhetoric is a lot more serious when it‚Äôs coming from a country that actually can do it and is currently in the process of doing so. Palestine is a nation of children, the median age in Palestine is 19 years old, 43% of the population are literally kids. This isn‚Äôt to say Hamas is good. Hamas is an evil group that needs to be destroyed and is not looking out for the Palestinian people. Israel‚Äôs government/military can be the most evil and damaging entity in the situation while Hamas is also an evil and damaging entity, it doesn‚Äôt have to be one or the other. You don‚Äôt have to support Hamas to say the Palestinian people deserve to be free and Israel is doing more harm than anyone else. But objectively and indisputably the overwhelming majority of suffering, subjugation, and killing of innocents, has been committed by Israel against Palestine, not the other way around. And the abhorrent and evil treatment Israel subjects the Palestinian people to on a daily basis made it obvious to anyone that was paying attention that eventually it would lead to a large violent retaliation (which lets be clear, this is retaliation, not an unprovoked attack).
There you go, that's one of many  reasons the deal was turned down, I would put money that many more problems were in the way such as resources, money, food, business, politics, revenge, religion, outside nations, etc. Hamas are evil as I have stated for the 1000000th time, they are evil scumbags who will die horrible deaths and even that's not justice for them, but we need to understand the pschye behind why, WHY are they doing this, again a lottttt of reasons why, most probably crazy, but some I could understand, if I'm being mistreated by the jews, beaten, pissed on, property taken, children taken, power turned off, water turned off, internet turned off, government that is racist to me, spit on, father is killed, mother is raped, brothers are abused, I'm poor and live in poverty while the Jewish people are rich and live in luxury, and now extremist are promising me a better life a life with dignity, why would i not take up arms against those that hurt me? Again, hamas is evil and crazy, but Israel is also evil and racist and they break international laws like McDonald's makes burgers and they face no consequences because daddy USA backs them.
Bulldoze Gaza!!
I read a story on this a few days ago and cant remember where it was. So, yes the funds were released. However, those funds were released to Qatar instead of Iran. The whole point being that Qatar is the middleman between the humanitarian aid groups. Is it possible for Iran to be funding this still? Of course and they probably are. But, to say the 6b would cause for an immediate attack when this was obviously planned out for much longer than the release is just being willfully ignorant. Hamas sending rockets into Israel is not a dem vs republican issue.
Dude is a hero
OP what the hell does that even mean ?
Hamas are bad because of xyzX= murdering civiliansY= kidnapping civiliansZ= using their own civilians as human shields Arafat straight up said he turned down the deal because the extremists in his own people would assassinate him if he made the deal
That's a yikes....dude go outside and get some sun.touch some grass, meet a girl and come back it's not too late for you brother.
From Biden aid to Ukraine and Iran and the weapons left in Afghanistan! Biden should be jailed for treason.
then they will die alongside their fathers? For one time in the worlds history, mud hut monkeys are getting a taste of their own medicine.
Who disables their AAD?
Of course I know that, it's funny that anytime someone says Israel bad people will automatically start saying "well hamas are bad because of xyz!" Like I said there are no good guys here, everyone has fucked up, everyone is evil, everyone has failed, on various levels, at various times, and to not see that is blindness, ask yourself why they said no to that deal, there was probably more on the back end, politics, religion, ideals, revenge, etc, who knows, plus even if there was a 2 state, does that mean violence stops overnight? No. There would still be this hatred between the jews and Muslims, there would still be the alt right group of jews attacking people and starting conflict, we have no idea what that path has laid out, but what I do know is both sides are evil and both sides have their sins, and at this particular time. Israel pushed hamas and pushed and pushed until they got a reaction, and now thousands are dead. And that's the main point, all of this, and people are dead and the cycle continues...
And yet I bet if I looked at your post history you‚Äôve never once called out when Israel celebrates when it massacres innocents by magnitudes more than Palestine. Hamas is evil, it is a problem, this situation is not black and white. But if you don‚Äôt think the Israeli government and the IDF are the most evil and doing the most harm in this situation then you‚Äôre not paying attention. This wasn‚Äôt a surprise. The effective genocide Israel is doing against the Palestinians and the open-air concentration camp they‚Äôve transformed Palestine into made it clear that eventually this would lead to a large violent backlash. That doesn‚Äôt mean the mass murder and torture of civilians that Hamas is doing is good or justified, but it‚Äôs a direct result the apartheid state Israel has imposed on the people of Palestine.
Why? Is video fake? I don't care about either Israel or Palestine. I just wonder if this video is true.
Of course Israel is gonna wipe the floor with them that's not even a question, but then what about the sons of the men who are killed by Israel, they will grow up with hatred and revenge, and then, the vicous cycle continues, thousands more die, on both sides, and people will wonder why.
What's wrong with her? I mean, why would she jump out of a perfectly good airplane?
I was just responding to your statement that Isreal needs to change.   You know the Palestinians could have had a two state solution with pretty much everything they wanted like two decades ago.
They all need to change, to not see that is you showing your blindness
Israel has been breaking internationl laws and human rights for decades.Its not their land, they are invaders. Even on this sub there was a vido of Iraeli sniper shoting a child held by his father, how jews spit on and thow trash at christians for simply walking by.What is one day some fkn dude walked into your home, said its his now and locked you and your family in the garage with no electicity? Would it be inhumane to try to break out and kick him out of your home?
I think the video is propaganda undermining the whole history between Israel and Palestine.
There  is no reason to jump out of a perfectly good airplane
What are the telegram channels that have videos?
I think it is all staged. I think that it is all a part of a bigger plan. They knew that Israel would respond with heavy fight. I mean they went in with minimal weapons and support. They had to turn right back around and run home afterwards. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if a country like Iran isn‚Äôt using hamas to stir up the hornets nest and get a couple other super powers involved eventually. It‚Äôs sad that man kind is so cruel not just hamas but all of us. I hope this is the beginning to god coming back and putting an end to all this shit.
and Russia. This helps Putin immensely
I'm with you on that. But complacency is a severe bitch when she catches you out like it seems here. It can happen to the most elite troops once a pattern is set. I don't doubt these messianic maniacs nor Netanyahu the top mafia Don and narcissist are capable of something like this if it finally means burying the two-state solution and returns all of what they consider Eretz Israel for good. These are deeply indoctrinated ministers and a deeply corrupt and ambitious flawed man.
Israel has been committed human right violations and violating international law for 2 decades and no one cares, when the victims fight back it‚Äôs a problem
Now this is a real hero.
The most scary part is that Iran can offord to give more money to ISIS or other terrorists. ISIS may be able to send it's fighters through the widely open south border. See what happened in Israel. Are we prepared? Some people are stupid, others are not. If we think ISIS is stupid, then we are.
Bruh im not being edgy.  Its fucking true.  This is what happens when you allow rubes to believe fairy tales.  Whats edgy about that? Unless you are part of the 5% of humans on this planet that thinks fiction written 2000 years ago is actually real actually
That's the point!
Walther Filipek
Well Im sure the Israeli people didnt celebrate the children getting bombed on the gaza beach playing football or the bombing of a disabled hospital in gaza either. But its been 16+ long years in the openair prison that is gaza strip so freedom may be worth celebrating for some.
I mean people celebrate the US military always‚Ä¶
They cry out as they strike you
They cry out as they strike you
Wipe them all out, fuck Gaza they are evil and should be wiped clean to keep peace
As an American I am appalled at how much money has been given to the people of Gaza and that nobody verifies that it‚Äôs spent as humanitarian assistance. It‚Äôs obvious that some financial aid for Hamas came from those funds. Other fanatical Islamic shit groups also give them weapons and money.
You‚Äôre a fucking idiot!
Doesn‚Äôt mean they literally used that same money sent. It increased their budget.
Wild how excited people are for violence and war. Like really wild
Yes I am so sick of conspiracy spreading...so sick of the lies, the anger, the inhumanity...it is revolting.  Everyone who spews conspiracy is responsible .
That's too troublesome. I'm glad I could care less about parachute. One less way to die as well.
No means to leave?  They can‚Äôt walk or run?
I feel that this war will never be over. So why does Israel allow the Gaza Strip to exist? Israel controls water, power and access to Gaza. Cut off the Egyptian access, cut water and supplies and slowly push the people out. Transplant the Gaza people to the West Bank when they are willing to leave.  It will be a matter of time before living in Gaza will not be possible. It is horrible any way that you look at it, but reduce your enemy strongholds.
Think about possibilities..... Did the White House defense sound logical and reasonable?
Middle east in general has more problems than I can keep up with.
Israel is going to wipe those Gaza cheeks, goat fuckers taking hostages isn't going to stop it
There's no God, heaven, or hell. People are shit.
Lol! You can‚Äôt even prove your own claim. Show us the receipts of the money moving and give us the links. Don‚Äôt do the type snake shit if google and find out. OP you and many other drones spread DIP. This does nothing but divide folks.
Yes. AAD. They can be disabled, but are required for AFF training programs.
Maybe the Palestinians need to change or this will keep happening.
War corrupts the soul
Israelis have superior forces &amp; weapons. This is a complete destruction of Gaza. Israel has been molesting Palestini economy, stealing their lands &amp; resources, deprived them of water &amp; electricity &amp; terrorizing their people for decades. Netanyahu is a terrorist!
A Hindu girl in Israel being burned by hamas? Or totally unrelated?
The 6 billion has not spent yet! Iran has been selling arms to Putin for over a year. No one is looking at how Iran made money before this event?!@#$%. The 6 billion is nothing relative to what Iran has been selling arms all over, especially to the Russian.
Massacring civilians isn't very nice.
Everyone knows who is the real monstrous animal. You were shelled after launching rockets to the civilian population in Israel, and you die because you choose to be body shields to the Hamas HQ and their rockets launchers.Israel always warned population to evacuate before it bombs the hamas infrastructure - no one warned the children and women that you slaughtered by shooting to their heads in their fucking homes. You are the animals who cheered while rapes and lynching of tied hostages just occured on your streets.
UN, US, NATO should stay away from this conflict. It's Irael's doing, it has been terrorizing Palestinians daily in control manner that the world can't see. Israel has been stealing land, fishes, mineral rights, blocking aid &amp; food supplies to Palestinians, over 60% of the Palestinians are living below poverty done by Israelis. I am not a Muslim; I have been following up both sides of the stories. In desperation Palestinians do stupid moves like this, because they feel like they have nowhere to go but this.
Naw, just tired. Inarticulate sloppy responses at this point Had to Google karma farming
Ew
So BS, what we need to look at the situation that led to this point. Israelis' current government are known to feed the world lies. The Israelis are protesting Netanyahu for months now, he's an evil man. Hamas is playing directly into Netanyahu's hands. Because of this there will be no election, Netanyahu is staying in power. Why is he allowed so many rockets entering Israel? Israel has the best rocket detections in the world??!@#$% Netanyahu wants this so he can push Israelis down &amp; distracted them with the war against Palestinians, &amp; not fighting to get rid of him.
Either way, very sad‚Ä¶ probably the worst death anyone can suffer
All those bastards will pay with their lives. Revenge is a dish best served cold. Israel always caught all the murderers of its civillians - always.
I always thought the guy flying the plane for this kinda stuff has the BEST JOB ON THE PLANET. And he *never* jumps out the fucking plane. Which is more my style lol
Bro did you learn history from Wendy's?? What bullshit are you even saying?
I'm hearing the video going around is of a hindu girl, unrelated to Israel.
I pray it is too, but I cant imagine that any of the hostages will survive‚Ä¶ i am sure they will all have a horrible end‚Ä¶ very sad‚Ä¶
Are you a bot? I‚Äôm looking though your account it literally looks like your karma farming
I dunno, I've seen a few videos of isrealites spitting on christians for being christian. They certainly hate the palestinians for more than their land, over the years.
What? Where did you read that? I'm talking about both civilians. War crimes aren't justifiable, no matter who does it.
Hamas and Israeli government are at fault and people die for it. The people would live their lives better if it wasn't for extremists of both sides, both sides have people who are muslim, Christian, jew, secular, etc and still live together as friends and good neighbors
The world needs more parking lots!!
Beautiful!!!!
I hope it's false, her father was heartbroken and pleading all over the news for her safe return. An Israeli doctor friend of mine refused to send it to me because it was so heartbreaking...
Finally, someone understanding difference between extremists and normal people. Finally some ACTUAL human being on here
There is no way you read my post that fast your just a pro Israel bot
Tell me in English how much you are upset
I don't support hamas at all, i know of the situation of people who aren't right wing extremists of either muslim ethnicity or Jewish, who live their lives together, but Israel has done WAAAY more than yiu can imagine since 1948 until now, and it has mostly been IDF who has the most right wing people you can imagine, and hamas being filled with either angry young people or corrupt cocksuckers, this fight is ONLY gonna end in bloodshed of the innocent, it has been for 78 years. Israel and Palestine will never stop but the one who started all of this was Israel from the beginning and they caused start of a chain of conflicts that will never end. People die when they haven't even done anything, while Israel, IDF, hamas, hezbollah and the likes are at fault
Free Palestine üáµüá∏
shut up bro
I'm not justifying their actions In any way. Reread my comment and you'll see me point is that you can't say this started with the actions of the Palestinians. The hatred the Palestinians have been holding for the group that's been oppressing and victimized them has festered into an ugly war.The brutal killings of civilians and the way the attacks are going out in general are horrible and I detest the actions of these groups.That's not to say I don't understand that the brutality of these actions are from a place of deep seated hatred for a group that's been responsible for not only desecration of their churches but blantent oppression by force.But in your logic Isreal should also be taken care of for their crimes and brutal inhumane practices in warfare.
A bunch of privileged redditors will never understand this nor do they know about the massacres conducted by Israel in Lebanon.
At least it wasn't another gender reveal party.
The country who‚Äôs using white phosphorus on a country that half the population is under 18? Fuck your moral compass lmfao
Would you call the murder of civilians from around the world in Israel organized resistance? I don't think the history of oppression is okay, but terrorist attacks aren't going to fix anything. In fact, they make it all much worse.Palestinians as a group have not put this down. Now they will suffer more. I was a supporter of a free palestine, but now I believe it probably can never exist. I'd be happier if I saw Palestinians protesting and resisting Hamas, but all I've seen is them celebrating them.The world is hard and unfair. Some people are born in awful circumstances. But still, they need to act to improve the future. Otherwise, things will always get worse.
I think the US internet service providers are filtering it out‚Ä¶ I cant find it anywhere, but eventually the video, if true, will make its way to reddit and 4chan
Cuz that‚Äôs where the people attacking them hide‚Ä¶ no way around it cuz Palestinians are such cowards
I knew how it ended and still was nervous as hell watching this.
UN ARMY
I was mostly worried she would accidentally throw your chute and screw herself. Do chutes still have that device that will deploy t automatically when altitude gets below a certain point?
Yes, I've heard the same can anyone verify?
Yes. People saying no don‚Äôt understand how dictatorships work
Thorough take, helpful link.
Their neighbors have tried for 76 years to wipe out Israel... and failed each and every single time.They'll say 'But western support for Israel!'The Soviet Union was sending tanks, infantry carriers, SAM systems, SPAAGs, field artillery, fighters, bombers, helicopters and small arms to Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Still failed.Heck, the Soviet Red Air Force sent a fighter regiment or two to Egypt during the War of Attrition and got wafflestomped by the Israeli Air Force.When will they learn? Israel is here to stay.
Finally someone with common sense on Reddit!
So was the IRADoesn‚Äôt make England right . You‚Äôre always a terrorist when you face an evil empire . We gonna go to world war 3 cuz our country and the evangelical Christian‚Äôs tryna fulfill a prophecy in Zion . But don‚Äôt call me anti semitic lol Arabs are semites too ! Isreal commits war crimes uses white phosphorous . Luke Skywalker was a terrorist .
Never forget that hamas was funded by isn'treal to destroy leftist and progressive Palestinian organizations
Of course its Palestine's fault for getting invaded smh. They should accept every offer made by their oppressors right? Fucking dickhead
It doesn't justify anything. It never will. Grow a moral compass and actually support the real victims instead of picking a side on a war of bad guys vs bad guys.
https://x.com/BenShapiroShow/status/1711418033913078162?s=20
You're right. This is bad guy vs bad guy. Normal sane people who have a working moral compass judge inhumane acts regardless of who's committing them. Israel has done them, Palestine is doing them. It's not justifiable and the civilians are the ones who'll suffer.
I wouldn't say an extremist insurgency, created through the actions of a systematic oppression and victimization of the Palestinian people, quite qualifies as the Palestinians starting the conflict. Id argue the gradual annexing of a country and the ww2 style ghettos created for the oppressed people is worthy of an organized rise to protect a victimized people to a certain extent.
Hamas uses civilians as cover, it's no secret, it's not new, its been going on for decades.  It demonstrates their disrespect for innocent life.... it's pure evil.  Give Israel credit for at least using costly precision weapons (and delayed fuses to keep the majority of the blast below ground) when attempting to defend itself from indiscriminate firing of these unguided rockets from civilian areas into Israeli cities.  Israel could be like Syria or Russia and just indiscriminately level the place... but they don't.  They are attacking military targets, most are placed by Hamas knowing that when they are attacked it will be the civilians who pay the price and become martyrs for their cause.... whether the civilians want to be or not.  I wouldn't be surprised if Hamas are now using the captured Israeli civilians, especially the elderly, women, and children (well, the ones that they didn't kill in cold blood over the weekend but instead took hostage) to be human shields for their military targets.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uE3feo\_b8Cg&amp;ab\_channel=FRANCE24English
The Hamas decided to invade Israel and Lebanon is probably going to directly help them. Oh yeah, the US has also deployed an aircraft carrier because 9 US citizens have been killed, and probably more have been kidnapped. So this might actually escalate even more.
This isn't a matter of Islam vs Jews or whatever, I am an atheist and I fully support palestine. I can never imagine the death of innocent civilians, and I hate seeing children and women dying. But let's just make it clear, A settler is an aggressor, a soldier, and an occupier even if they are lounging on occupied beaches. There exists a colonizer and the colonized, an oppressed and the oppressor. The people cannot be dissociated from resistance. How can I walk into someone's house and claim its mine and shoot up everyone who is it. Can you convince me how a polish, a German, a Russian, an American has a right to the land and not the natives living there? I am ready to heat and have a civilised conversation. When the zionist marched into Palestinian houses they never asked if they were Muslim or Christian they just killed them. This isn't a conflict, this is a one sided thing, the state of Israel along with its people have been killing palestians and segregating them for the past 75 or so years and palestine has finally had enough of it and is fighting back. When tyranny becomes law then resistance becomes duty, there is no two state solution, the Israelis should go back to their countries and leave palestine for the Palestinians. How can you even believe otherwise I have no idea.
But it's true
I didnt mention anything about Hamas so i dont understand why you replied to me.
Crazy, I didn‚Äôt realize they allowed stockpiles of weapons/ammunition in prisons.
Free Palestine &lt;3.
This is propaganda!
You've chose a side, publicly.
Edgy..  on Reddit.. super original.  A toddler wants a nap and a snack.  Maybe a stone to play with..  shouldn‚Äôt be bombed over someone else‚Äôs bull shit religion they don‚Äôt understand yet.
Iran duh
They are their own victims for wanting to live in the stone age
Ever just feel like you're not being truly *seen*?
Wouldn‚Äôt thwarting these attacks before they happened be a better look???
Right? Was Palestine just supposed to keep letting this happen? A revolution isn‚Äôt pretty lmao
Artillery shelling and going house to house raping and murdering aren't the same.
The money was never released.  It's still in the bank.  This is republican bullshit.
Where can I find all the videos
Assimilate into Israeli culture knowing they will be second class citizens or emigrate.They have lost. No reason to continue the violence.
Could rebuild Maui...???? Just a thought
I‚Äôm not going to defend anything those fools did once they got across Israel‚Äôs border.  It requires stiff response to those responsible.   Casualties of war are often those of the innocent.  Collateral damage.  As a man, I understand.  As a parent, it‚Äôs sad.
Yes.
Like I said Biden needs to go it‚Äôs horrible it‚Äôs like he wanted this shit to happen
Info Wars
Israel slaughters Palestinian teenagers every day. Are you willing to admit that or are you just arguing in bad faith?
I guess my cave in the US.   They‚Äôre told to get out, but they can‚Äôt leave.   That‚Äôs all I‚Äôm confused about.  If I lived there, and wasn‚Äôt a terrorist, and have a family, wtf would I do?   End of day it is what it is, they‚Äôll get bombed to shit.   When you clean up the rubble and children are under, how do you justify it.    Maybe you oughta crawl back in your cave there Dex.
Yo freaking hero there wow that was awesome
he actually looks incompetent for letting this happen on his watch.
Don‚Äôt be a jerk. Racism, sexism, lgbtq+ phobia , hate in general, and direct attacks on others will not be tolerated here. Your first offense will be a warning, second will be a 15-day ban, and third will be a perma-ban. Be nice!
the rockets are not new. they shoot them at israel constantly.
They opened up a can of worms doing that to Israel
Flatten every masque, that's where the weapons are and the terrorists.
Someone died
What cave did you just crawl out of?  Where do you think the scum is hiding and launching rockets from?  The middle of a field? Gaza civilians and non combatants were warned to get the Fuck out.
Imagine if he wasn‚Äôt able to regain contact with her the 2nd time
Most people who call themselves republican are assholes
They weren‚Äôt being oppressed by innocent tourists at a music festival. They lash out at those who can‚Äôt lash back
Fair point from all of you.  Just thinking of the innocent children and women who have no part in this.    And no means to leave.     Seems wrong.   Response warranted, but should be targeted.   They even killed some of their own hostages on accident while indiscriminately bombing back.    Israel should respond, but women and children have always been off limits in most conflict.
Let's not forget that Hamas claimed to have launched over 5,000 rockets into Israel at the start of this.
Outstanding
Go to the Treasure Department of Iran and find evidence if you can. Good luck!
I‚Äôm not an instructor, but I‚Äôve jumped and have time in a tube. To me it looks like a wrong arch and hold - she‚Äôs causing the problem / may not be strong enough to hold the position.
"I don't like hamas but I support their lashing out of killing civilians". Nice argument idiot. And I'm not a jew what the fuck are you on about üíÄ. It's as simple as don't support the terrorists murdering and parading civilians through the streets. How the fuck is that hard to understand. The Israeli government is wrong for the murders of innocent Palestinians.  Hamas and the Palestinians who refuse to acknowledge how bad the terrorist attack is are wrong for supporting the mass murder of jews. It's not a hard concept
One airstrike = one ofThem gets executed Glory to the original land of palestina üáµüá∏and the one who unfortunately helped the dirty jews after ww2
I've heard that Israel has one of the best intelligence groups in the world. How was Hamas setting up thousands of rockets, eventually launched into Israel on a 140 sq mi piece of land without anyone noticing?
Ukraine didn‚Äôt attack russia.  Russia brutally attacked Ukraine.  I would love to see rockets flying into Moscow the way Israel is doing to Gaza.
No it makes them like Hamas.
These guys are laughing about committing war crimes... that is evil.
Here we go an airless claim. Where is the evidence?
Scary
Ok, what the absolute everliving incellite depraved loser fuck is this. These guys probably got rejected once at prom and now hate women for, Being women?!? The same guys who just wack off to their pics. They probably getting off to these vids too, disgusting
These are the people who have become too fat to even stand up and go outside to touch grass, all that time stuck in their parents basements has rotted their brains.

Unfortunately for you, I think you put me in the wrong box. I don't like hamas and they don't like me. I just say it as I see it. I am just another Christian that gets spat on by respectable people like you.Keep on spitting and you'll have another people lashing out üòâ
Doesn't justify acting the exact same way you fuckin hypocrite. You're no better than them. Murderer scum

Did she pass out or lock up ? You would normally do tandem jumps prior to a solo I would imagine if she passed out easily they would have known before this. That instructor was on the ball knowing so quickly something was wrong and taking action. Definitely the kind of person I would want watching me in this situation.
Who pissed in your cereal in the morning this time?
I get you, I hope it is a coincidence. But Iran‚Äôs checkered past is questionable if it quacks like a duck it must be a duck.
And the badass award goes to...
Why? These things take time and coincides happen. Working off a tingle in your bones?
Oh wow.  Netanyahu is going to be so popular letting this happen.  He let it happen while he is prime minster.  Smart poster will say this makes him more popular.  I would blame him for being asleep at the post.  He should resign.
well, you need to learn a thing or two about trauma coping. Because from your pov it may look like evil, and it sure is. But laughing is one of many coping mechanisms related to trauma. So they might be laughing, but that does not necessitate that they think what they did is funny.
Let's watch and see what happens..
Blah blah blah that side this side. You're the real POS here for being okay with innocents being murdered on one side only.
I don't think they will do that tbh, I would imagine that they have killed hella hostages already
üíØ, people are kidding themselves if they think that this is a coincidence.
Being war criminals like you. You're both trash. Killing civilians who have nothing to do with their government makes you the biggest scum on earth. You seriously thought hamas could walk into Israel and kill everyone in their way and that they wouldn't be bombed off the face of the earth? Actions have consequences. If you want to fight the Israeli government then fight the government. Not killl every Jew in your way and parade their mutilated body through the streets.
Keep reading.
"the victims were buried in a mass grave, which today serves as a car park for the nearby [Tel Dor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Dor) beach "Wow.....just depressing.
Lashing out with their "eye for an eye", what do you think the Jewish Israelis have been doing all this time üòî
Looks like it
This reminds me of when the guy pulled his own shoot after Peggy Hills shoot fails
I don‚Äôt know why the executive branch is controlling where money is spent now.
This is a demonstration of sub-pigeon levels of critical thinking right here.
Lashing out revolves around murdering civilians and parading their bodies through the street? And you sit there and wonder why the rest of the world wants you dead. Hamas supporting scumbag
Was she unconscious?
Money is fungible
We literally have no evidence for this conspiracy, everything is just heresay at this time, we will likely never know the depth of mistakes  leading to this. But if i had to guess there may have been some kind of sabotage or inside man like a cyber attack or something.
Not necessarily. Soviet-bloc weapons were widely copied (often without a license) and distributed en masse during the Cold War.Some 200 million AK-47 rifles have been produced since 1948. That‚Äôs about 1 for every 35 people.
Intensity 5000 for both involved I imagine.Her: I‚Äôm safeInstructor: I‚Äôve got herHer: No I‚Äôm not Instructor: FuckHer: Fuck!
Oh wow that would be crazy.
Lol
You telling me that  One of the highliest contested Borders in human history where atrocities happen all the time Where Israel's had the flare foot on the palestinians peoples throat for an unconsciable amount of time Had no idea about a giant build up?  We're talking about the most sophisticated of all time... just no idea.. not even a clue. 1 To me that's more of a conspiracy than anything
Nice save bud
My thoughts exactly, I mean seriously this is so un popular thinking but yes
The first war on Israel was it defending itself from Palestine, Iran, and Egypt, who banded together because they're Muslim and didn't want Jews living in proximity to them. I wish it was something more simple like economics that can be peaceful resolved but a holy war where one side will stand for nothing less than the total destruction of the Jewish people will be harder to end without massive bloodshed.
When you have a heavy Israeli boot on your neck for decades and finally manage to lash out at your oppressor, there is reason to celebrate. Unfortunately the cost of lashing out will be high, the world does not see the Palestinians as human beings.
It depends how close they are to the "west". Isreal is basically the only western nation accepted. But China, Japan, Thailand etc, they are mostly accepted. As well as some levels of like Saudi for the Arabs etc.
yeah and religious disputes are stupid. and i don't think it's about religion, it's probably about economy like every other dispute, but that's just a guess.
What happened?
If I saw that outside my window I‚Äôd be calling in UAV pretty quick.   3 down
If only Palestine had the foresight to accept a deal in 1948 they would have their own state. No they wanted to massacre Jews with the help of the Arab league. They lost but tried again and again but failed.
Byeplane
I remember reading somewhere the banking jobs were the only jobs available at a time and Jewish peeps by circumstance took those jobs. Good for them, I say.
no but neither did the palestinian population, the amount of israelis that died in 2 days of the war is only a tenth of how many palestinians died or were injured because of IDFs god complex over the muslims in israel. You cant just tell me israel is right because theyre both way in the wrong
Now that's a damsel in distress, with all due respect
Sorry the people replying werent very helpful, yes it was an idf strike. Idf claim that thier strikes are on military targets and Hamas is known to keep important military targets near civilian areas. By the looks of it it was probably a revenge strike
All I can think of when seeing this is just "Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
Doesn‚Äôt mean we don‚Äôt have them.
When they get the money, they will most likely try to use it for something in else. But, they already got those billions of dollars worth of weapons when Biden just pulled the soldiers out of Pakistan.
Wow really quick thinking on the instructors part! Well done
&gt;For example Jamie Lee Curtis posted a photo of children looking up at missiles saying that they were Israeli children but you know what?I saw that, what an idiot. Most ppl dont understand the situation. They just here biased snippets from their favorite whoever and run with it.
Well that‚Äôs what I mean. Everyone is eager to jump on the bandwagon without actually looking at the facts. For example Jamie Lee Curtis posted a photo of children looking up at missiles saying that they were Israeli children but you know what? The photo was actually of Palestinian children. It‚Äôs tragic that kids have to be in this situation period but I just wish people would look at both sides instead of instantly vilifying the other just because that‚Äôs what‚Äôs popular.
The other Turks think that because this isn't a land dispute, it's a religious dispute. Anyone who says it's a land dispute are the same people who would say the American civil war was about state's rights.
Agreed. I just wish everyone isnt so pro-israel, Palestine bad about it. Thats the dumbest conclusion to make.Edit: Must've hurt alot of feelings with that factoid.
Palestine must translate to piece of shit
I'm just now trying to get informed on this topic. If Isreal is such a close ally to the U.S, then why are we sending aid to the gaza strip and Iran. Especially when Iran seemingly hates the U.S? Surely Isreal doesn't like that the US is sending them aid? Maybe I'm confused, tho. im still very uninformed
I'm intrigued by....hot snail water.
is this a joke clarify
Israel has been occupying Palestine for 75 years obviously war is never a good thing but yeah they aren‚Äôt saints either.
If I know I will get some extra money tomorrow, I probably will spend some money today planned for tomorrow, for something else üòï
People supporting a group who openly approve of rape, forced marriage, political assassination, religious extremism, violent torture, murder at any age, etc etc etc just because "Le Israel bad" is hilarious to me. Apparently taking rights away from people in the US is alright if you don't agree with them, but take rights/land away from people in the Middle East who openly cheer for your murder and have been doing so for years is wrong. Israel has done some bad moves but Hamas and Palestinians are a different kind of beast that openly want to genocide an entire race...
You can use humor to mask trauma AND also be a bad person. Them laughing about trauma doesn't make them bad people. It's the acts that they committed that made them bad people. Just so we're straight. They are indeed still bad people.
If you are both then you should be able to see that Israel is an apartheid state and Palestine is the largest open air prison where even Israel controls, limits, and even has poisoned the water. Hamas is terrible but I see Hamas as less of a threat than Israel. Israel has done more than enough harm to Palestine which it has no business controlling from the beginning.
I mean, no, probably not, but even if they could, none of the money has even been released yet, so .....
U ain't gonna get what u want soo suck it up
??? The average life expectancy in Gaza is 73.7 years‚Äîthe same as Turkey and higher than Egypt, Bulgaria, India, and Jamaica. The median age of 18 is just due to there being a lot of young people because of a high birth rate.
See that's where this issue gets controversial. Coming from a guy who has both Israeli and Palestine - descended friends, this war is not as black and white as most would want it to beOn one hand the Israelis have been treating the Palestinians in occupied land abhorrently with hostilities too numerous to name. On the other hand the Palestinians are being backed by dangerous extremist elements like Hamas and Hezbollah who don't see the value of Israeli human livesIt's a cycle of spite, bloodshed and pain which is being egged on by (no thanks to) foreign powers who don't give a damn about the individuals most affected by the conflict.
I wish Israelis who oppose the oppression of Palestinians, and the Palestinians who aren't against Israel's right to *exist *peacefully** outnumbered the others a 1000 to one. But then the horror that transpired Saturday wouldn't have been a thing and we wouldn't be venting about it while knowing worse is yet to come.
These are mostly  citizens...they didnt do anything killing children other innocent people isn't gonna do a thing
Always with the conspiracy please stop

You are literally so fucking dumb
If Ukrainians have the right to freedom, so do Palestinians. If you are put people in ‚Äúopen prison‚Äù for 16 years, and kill 1000s and 1000s of them over these years, take their houses away, there is gonna be retaliation. If you tell me where you live I would love to come kick you out of your house and see how you react
Long history of double dealing. Gotta make sure you‚Äôre on the right side of victory. By playing both sides
Go do some research before you run your pathetic little mouth.
No u
You are fucking dumb
What unrestricted access to the internet since childhood does to a mfer. On a serious note carrier group ford give them hell
In scale? Are you having a fucking laugh mate.  One day of attacks against Israel and the world went crazy when shit like that happens daily in gaza. People like you have given the TRUE murderers what they want. A free pass to genocide.  Sit back and watch an entire population get massacred then come back on here talking about scale. Fucking muppet
right we are saying the same thing pretty much. Speaking out and protesting are enough to be not too guilty, but there are lots and lots and lots of israelis who have no problem moving right into someone else's actual house, settling in illegal over the border settlements, etc. then there is the whole subset of people who start foaming at the mouth crying anti Semitism at the first critical word of israel, youve got your nutbag fundamentalist christians all over who believe israel is required to exist for Jesus to come back who let israel get away with anything it wants, theres alot of blame to go around here. what Israel is doing is wrong and criminal end of story. the rocket attacks wouldnt have happened in the first place had they taken a more humane approach in the first place. thus, lots and lots and lots of israelis and by extension the jewish people have no one to blame but themselves for this one.
Thousands of missiles to neighboring countries?? Loool I can argue with someone at this level of ignorance.
Damn that girl is hot
Both sides are in the wrong they both have blood on there hands and need to stop going to war and invading each other
my logic does make sense. any democratically elected government rules through consent of the people check it out. thus, if people don't make alot of noise about things they disagree with their government doing, they are sort of culpable. americans are somewhat culpable in iraq/afghanistan, which was a crime, and I think Israelis/Jews are somewhat culpable in the crimes being committed against palestinians. this feels alot like what we did to the native americans, they just didn't have the equipment and whole nation states to feed the weapons to retaliate. you reap what you sow in my opinion
It's not about god. They are communists.
Wow this website needs to be reported to the feds
His foot fell off!
I have a wild idea, stop sending thousands of missiles to neighbouring countries and stop using children as human shields. I have seen Palestinians killing defenceless children and woman by hand on the video released by Palestinians. I have yet to see that kind of atrocities by IDF. So don't tell me Palestinians are victims. That ship has sailed.
The ppl occupying then are causing carnage to them regardless if they do anything or not. Anyone aware of the conditions Palestinians live under due to Israelis regardless what is occurring there? Its absolute cruelty. Israel is literally an apartheid state and the reason why the average age in Palestine is 18 years old as there hardly are anyone who survives to be old surviving Israel. They have Palestinians living in the biggest open-air prison ever.What you are suggesting is like telling them to be obedient and suffer because they have been conquered.
Oh yeah I knew this was some pro-israel shitstorm sub. Fuck you POS. I bet you dont look at Israel as being colonizing terroristic occupying force, but when ppl rebel against that occupying force and what they have been put through, they are the bad guys. No love, no sympathy for Israel.
Yeah you‚Äôre not the only one thinking that.  What‚Äôs a few thousand civilians if it locks in your power position?
So I ask you, sincerely, what do you want Palestinians to do in order to live in peace and freedom? What do you want them to do
Someone tell me that snail water isn't what I think it is.
In 2021, the Bidon admin released $75 million "economic and development assistance as part of a $235 million aid package to Gaza.  Keep in mind, Hamas is in charge of Gaza at this time.  Shortly there after the Biden admin sent another $15 million in so called Covid19 assistance.https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-56665199The USs own Government Accountability Office warned that they were worried that Hamas could use the money for non-humanitarian purposes but the Democrats in congress passed the legislation anyway and of course Biden signed it and the money was sent.I'm guessing some of that free money offset what Hamas would otherwise have to spend on keeping the lights on allowing them to spend it on rockets and machine guns to attack Isreal with.
We just released 6 billion in frozen assets to Iran for a hostage exchange in September. While USA might not be ‚Äúdirectly‚Äù funding terrorism, our actions sadly allowed this attack to be funded, as Hamas is completely tied to Iran, who is their biggest state sponsor.
But sadly we did just released $6 billion to them‚Ä¶.
What? Plz go see a doctor. I think you are having a stroke.
This is so fucked up. Hed need to face consequences, but the sad thing is he probably never will
don't really care about redditors right now so I'll just ignore thatI just don't get the mentality where you would attempt to risk the lives of the people of your own nation --and i'm no nationalist by the way, i'm making this remark from a practical standpoint and a belief that it's in the best material interest of every nation for each nation keep to themselves as long as it is not necessary-- to save some people you identify with because of their religion or race. I'm a Turk and I'm just fucking baffled at other Turks who want Turkey to be involved in this shit just because the Palestinians are muslims so we're brothers or something. Think for two seconds.
you sir are a prime example of there being reasonable people in the world, you didn't shoot down his argument directly knowing he won't listen but instead explained something in a non argumentative way based on facts, more people should strive to act this way.
Iran, which got its funding from the Obama, Biden administrations
Looks like its a coping mechanism to me
That's the first thing you become, superior to the evil, corrupt, nasty enemy. Your side is vastly superior, moral, and just - the other side is vile and needs killing. Every country, people, military has done this since warring was created by Satan.
Exactly.
Here is the difference. Israeli soldiers typically weren't going from house to house murdering all men, women, and children. If they killed noncombatants it was because of collateral damage or because Hamas was using non combatants as human shields. Trying to fire rockets from schools hoping that Israel would just let them keep shooting because they were intentionally keeping non combatants around the places they were firing from. Hamas is not capable of achieving their goals by military means. So any attempt to do so just equals terrorism. If there was even a tiny sliver of hope then you could call them freedom fighters. But as it stands now they are a conquered people. It would be the same as if Native Americans started butchering people outside of their reservations. Zero hope of retaking their homeland. All it will do is cause carnage.
Imagine being stupid enough to support Biden after all of this.
Get rotated

Terribly coincidental that this video pops us straight after an *organised* massacre of Israelis...Pro Palestinians trying to even the field...Comparing war crimes that happen during a war (which every country sadly is guilty of, including USA and UK), to this intentional attack and raping and murder of innocent civilians is a rather childish attemptDon't mix up Israelis civilians with what Israeli security forces do, the same way we don't mix up Hamas terrorist with the Palestinians in gaza who are the real ones who suffer from all this
Thank you for this. It's not even close, but their perpetual victimhood can't allow them to see the reality they've become what they always hated.
Are you implying that the brain in a body says "let the heart die I'll take care when it stops" ? Don't you think that is absurd? For a moment, even if what you say is true, then wasn't there a chance to withdraw the attack by the terrorist organisation ? I don't think so, do you? And what about the people that were at the dessert festival? Were they holding any weapons of threat towards anyone? But they were kidnapped as evidenced by the videos shared by the terrorists themselves. So let me tell you: to admit what's happening is not the same as happening to admit. This is not a "surprise"attack per se bot a "shocking" attack!
Israel aren't the ones abusing the Palestinians and giving them the terrible life they are living. It's their own leadership like Hamas who are diverting humanitarian aid towards buying more weapons and then commiting more terrorism like they've just done. And they don't give 2 fucks about their own people. They deliberately set up their rocket launch sites from children schools and hospitals yo get the Israelis to bomb them.What israel do with regards to blockades and other such acts that are deemed as 'apartheid' is what any normal country would do when you have severe terrorist issues with a land right next to (and inside) your own land.Of course there are cases of Israeli brutality and war crimes (as there are in every war, by every country including USA and the UK during ww2 and iraq/iran), but to compare the brutality that all soldeirs seem subject to in the heat of battle after seeing ateocities themselves, to that of a organised attack deliberately on civilians, including raping, kidnapping and murdering women and children is a bit dense
Civilian with a rifle would have done a lot of damage here. Merica
My dad is technically British..His father was a serving soldier in Palestine then retired..so my dad was born in Palestine..One day the Jewish milita came to my dad's village.. Ordered everyone to leave. My grandmother tried to explain to them that they bought the land and were not technically Palestinian..They didn't care and told them they had to leave or would be shot..Later that day the miltia attacked the village with mortar fire. They didn't care if it killed woman or children..The family had to flee and dad ( a kid ) with only his older brother to help him ran for their lives..My dad remembers seeing bodies of a group of villagers hit by a shell men women and kids. He remembers taking cover in a shop. The cash still sitting in an open till. The owner gone..He said they looked up at the ceiling and there was an unexploded mortar shell hanging down..They eventually managed to get to Cyprus and with the help of the red cross find the rest of the family. Don't believe for one second there are not people in Israel that would kill you to get what they said god promised them. Also my grandfathers comrades would often be ambushed and killed by the Jewish milita.Its well documented how the militias acted ..now days we call them terrorist..
So let me get this straight, when Israel kills children (500 in the 2014 Intifadah), it is to be celebrated as a necessary act of self-defense, but when oppressed people living in the worst apartheid in modern history strike back, they are to be condemned?
My understanding is that Hamas is linked with &amp; funded by Iran.
A bitch
Imaginet the charges he will face, got a long one in jailwithhisvideo out here
If you want to claim righteous fury, you should take it out on the military, not civilians.
This would be a bangin crows nest. Too bad they‚Äôre unarmed.
How do you know they arn't celebrating removing the shackles of their oppressors? https://i.imgur.com/vyiGu5J.jpeg
Think of Nazis but the opposition. Just that for some reason we can‚Äôt directly say it. Some think they have some sort of alien intelligence which is how they took control of the banking system, the medical industry, and the education sector. They also control the media. Kings of propaganda allegedly.
There still is a difference, Hamas is primarily targeting civilians and raping women - motivated by Islamic religion and believe that women are worth less than men and are meant to be suppressed. It has nothing to do with a war about territory - show me videos in a significant number were Israel's soldiers rape, women, shoot children point blank in front of their sisters and parents and take people husted ob the back if pickupa truck to get beaten to death and then I'll change my mind - until that Hamas is nothing less than ISIS and needs to be eradicatedThe video u are likely referring to was old and it was a rubber bullet and the soldier went to jail for it - do Hamas ppl go to jail in Gaza for raping an killing kids?
Just because you don't see Israeli evil doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Only last week they shot someone in the head walking away from them.Any conflict you hear about 1 Israeli dead v 100 Palestinian dead. It's also disproportional aggression..You poke a dog with a stick into a corner it will bite.
I don't think so. They are saying will be traded for Palestinian prisoners. Fair deal.
It‚Äôs weird that if someone wanted any other racial state they‚Äôre racist , but it‚Äôs ok for Jewish people.
And what does that actually have to do with this video? There's always a bigger fish. Saying that there are worse things happening doesn't take anything away from this video, nor does it mean we shouldn't care.
I'm saying that at this moment , as we speak , a horror that is 100 times worse has just been committed by Hammas.Speaking about some guy laughing in a documentary about something from 80 years ago that pales in comparison is simply asinine .Speak about the teenagers that were butchered like animals in a music festival .Kids that are 16-20 years old had to run for their lives, and 260 of them were slaughtered by Hammas militants , when all they wanted was to just live and dance.https://youtu.be/w8IQN4yw7_8?si=1aKZulu7sB-pATVz
I'm not trolling. I'm telling facts! Sorry if you're offended by FACTS!
Like recognizing the right of Israel to exist.
???Why are you saying we shouldn't care about things that happened a long time ago? The video is interesting and history should not be forgotten.
Hamas is holding American hostages. They‚Äôve also shows they have no problem killing hostages, especially foreigners. We will see, but with a strike group headed that direction, British and German killed and taken hostage with the American ones, I don‚Äôt see a bright Hamas future.
Yeah I actually got really hyped for Leicester that season. I didn't have a way to watch the games and back then knew even less about football, but still thought the whole Cinderella season was awesome. I support Nashville SC in the MLS, since it's my hometown.

We don't make a AKs bruh
Do you have the mental capacity to at least acknowledge that Israel also did horrible things, not 80 years ago, literally basically every day. Of course, that doesn't excuse, or somehow justify what's happening now. But neither does what's happening now justify or excuse what Israel has been doing.
I only said that: while Turkey is actively INVADING Kurdistan, going through villages. YPG in this video carried out a specialized attack on the ministry, not the people. It was a message, not a terroriat attack, since it dis not involve everyday citizens.
I agree. But I do think we should draw a distinction between 'the Jews' and Israel. Its a small language thing, but perpetuates a really dangerous conflation between the Israeli state and everyone belonging to the religion.
Hamas is an organization, not a race/religion/culture. You don‚Äôt exactly genocide organizations.
In this case it was laughing about killing people. I don't count that as trauma coping, just evil.
Sometimes laughing is the only way they can do in order to be able to live with the horrible things they had to do in order to survive, both during the war and afterwards.
You're almost as stupid as your morals are messed. If I had to guess, you're from the US and you believe in God.
Reading these comments..This is why i dont trust the internet anymore..
I'm in Spain without the p
We both agree that what hammas did was brutal, cruel and unjustifiable but Israel had it coming. If you keep abusing people (stealing their homes and intoxicating their water...(look it up)) they will look to whatever salvation they can find even if it's some sick and twisted mfs who only care about killing the Jews.Also, Hammas was created by Israel as a way to divide the Palestinians (look it up) so Israel had it coming.
Harvesting airplanes today.
This looks extremely similar to a video posted I think a few days ago, where it was close to the peoples heads but there was no kind of collision? Looks like the same two planes over the same field.
Okay cos u almost sent me thenStill though, I don't think that's any sort of excuse to the atrocities these people faceI mean hypothetically speaking America has pissed off many nations right, now what if one of them nations invaded and started mindlessly killing civilians and two fuckos are on the Internet discussing it and one of them goes "well they chose to live in a country involved in political discourse"Like how does that wash
They mean both sides are fucking horrible...and they are right.
No I'm talking about the Right To Return that made Jews all over the world to move there.
...are you really equating the forced exile of holocaust survivors from Europe to British controlled Palestine at the time to "choosing to move there"
Literally everyone who lives in Israel moved there at some point because the country itself didn't exist 80 years ago.
Did the civilians who died recently move there or something
I'm not saying they should've moved out when they could, I'm saying what sane person would move into such an area when they could? Look at Afghanistan right now. Would you move there? Would anyone willingly? And if you did, would it not be partially your responsibility if eventually horrible things happened to you?
People die all the time man. Wars have been a thing since the dawn of civilisation .In this case, there was forced apartheid, killing, mass surveillance of one side etc over decades. If you take this recent incident into context, it‚Äôs merely a blip in this conflict.Essentially what happened recently is an example of what happens when a nation faces all of this crap for years. You get stupid people in Hamas who think more killing is a solution.
You fucking idiot
I don't understand what this is saying lol"Civilians are getting attacked, raped and murdered by a terrorist group but they didn't move to a different country when they had the chance so it's on them"like what the fuck is that
I wouldn't call it creepy. More like terrifying. Imagine being high on drugs, dancing, having a good time and then soldiers are dropping out of the sky, shooting at you killing people around you.
Can't you? It says "right wingers" in quotation marks. They're claiming to be the real right wingers mocking the fake ones. In other words, "no real right winger would support Jews" kind of shit.
Go troll somewhere else

Let's put it this way.Some aeas deep into Ukraine are already populated by Russians. A few days ago i saw some of those areas getting bombed by Ukrainians. Did the civilians not have it coming, deciding to live on occupied land?Sure the kids are clueless, but didn't the adults make a semi-conscious decision to continue to live where exactly these crimes were always a possibility and even a promise?

Basically a Jewish nationalist
Lmao, all these 5-10 year old videos about israel being spammed on reddit the past 2 days trying to change the narrative. Iran as bot accounts all over reddit.
Afghanistan via Iran. They used some weapons that were abandoned by the US after it withdrew.
Ooh boy!
Who cares about someone laughing now about something from 80 years ago WHEN THIS FUCKING WEEKEND 700 civilians were slaughtered by Hammas , 260 of them whole partying in a fucking music festival outdoors .You're talking to me about history of almost a century ago vs something that is happening right now .
But they're on israel side, but yea it has history of double dealing i think..
Well then Fuck IDF too. They are killing kids for fucks sake.
If it's true. I don't think it's directly sold from Russia.
they were celebrating a holiday in Isreal, how creepy being at a festival and bombs go off and all the sudden foot soldiers start charging shooting guns
Most of the west support the terrorist state of Israel so I don't understand whats the point your trying to make
You don't get to compare the size of atrocities when it is the same thing. That's what NO means you dumb fkk. Both sides have people killing people because they have been seeing this since they were born. VGrow the fck out of your comfort bed. The world is not that simple. Israel is not the good guy here. Neither is Hamas.
They were pissed at the Palestinians in the 1940s, the Grand Mufti of the Palestinians during WW2 praised Hitler's final solution and encouraged other Middle Eastern countries to follow suit. Even for years prior there had been attacks against the Jews living in Jerusalem.So there was really no love lost when Israel established itself as its own country.
It‚Äôs from a documentary about the [Tantura](https://m.imdb.com/title/tt16378034/).
So does that excuse him laughing about he did with his buddies? So if I shot someone‚Äôs kid 10 yrs ago and they comeback and massacre my father, mother, brother, kids and innocent bystanders does that give me a free pass just cause their murders are worse?
They slaughtered 260 teenagers in a music festival .They slaughtered and kidnapped families : men, women, children and elderly in their and from their homes - around another 550.What do mean by "no "-fucking imbecile ?
They and their buddies (accomplices) escaped and got to live their lives with no consequences. It‚Äôs like, for example, you and your buddies rob all the banks in town  and are never caught so the banks take measures to prevent such from happening. The newer generations never had the chance so it‚Äôs only the old guys who talk about it.
Isn't that pest control being sprayed? Aren't thry breathing that vapor?
Because as history has shown, Israeli soldiers that commit atrocities in Palestine often don‚Äôt have to face the consequences of their actions
Legit talking about a German peace activist like she fucking deserved to get raped and murdered is evilYeah I'm sorry these people are just not fixable
These are Russian made weapons AK-47‚Äôs, RPG‚Äôs are all Russian origin.

Didn‚Äôt know this fact as someone who watches soccer a few times a year and both world cups. but taking a second to think on it soccer (I‚Äôm American) players probably do the most cutting (changing directions) out of any sport with maybe basketball being the 2nd highest an even Acl tears aren‚Äôt that common.
What Hammas just did this weekend is x10 times worse in scale, and you're here talking about an atrocity committed almost 8 decades ago.You're a fucking moron.
Iran, who got the weapons from the US of A
So, they're so pissed off that they decided to slaughter 260 civilians at a music festival?[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIIzsW4FAGo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rIIzsW4FAGo)
everything that is described there is dwarfed by what Hamas just committed.

We're watching true monsters talking about the atrocities they did, like it was an episode of One Piece they watched yesterday.Smiling, laughing, talking about people like they were just insects... I can't believe how detached those monsters are, they simply don't give a damn.
Iran
How do we know this is real? Why would soldiers admit war crimes on camera?
Dont send water, send flames noah.
Ahh when the oppressed become the oppressors and the abused become abusersIsrael have relied on their painful history and utilised the world's sympathy and guilt to do the same to the Palestinians what was done to them. I know that after the War Europe was desperate to relocate the surviving Jewish people, somewhere safe,  but with hindsight they didn't really think through the long term repercussions of breaking up some fairly barren land from the indigenous population and creating an Israel surrounded by Muslims
Why is it always old people the biggest pieces of shit? And they said its the youth whats wrong with the world.
Did she really have an onlyfans tho? Asking for a friend
The same happened last week...but this time 200+ Palestinian victims ... Imagine that happened to one of your family numbers what you will do be honest?
This was exactly my take. People with brain diseases, hallucinations, schizophrenia and run of the mill diagnoses these days didn‚Äôt have any solutions or ideas about why people were the way they were. They were just the weird kid. That was pretty much it. There were no 504‚Äôs etc. Everyone was in a classroom together except the ‚Äúspecial‚Äù kids. That was it. No one on one, special teachers or accommodations. Later in life, they were the weird uncle who held odd jobs and never married, or the lady who has worked at Target for 20 years and is still a cashier. I personally know a guy who would have been diagnosed with something but we were in a small town and therapists were kept hush hush back then. We were FWB in high school and shortly after then lost touch. I saw him about 5 years later at a gay club in the city.  Not super surprised the gate swung both ways. Fast forward 20 years and I heard he‚Äôs a member of the Proud Boys. Weird, but not surprised. Incel, closet gay,etc. Weird how people we thought would be friends forever are now waaaay in the rear view mirror.
This is one the more nauseating things I've read... and I've read the Bittaker/Norris transcript multiple times.
Exactly!  How dare that combine be in its field doing its harvesting thing.  Its not like he had a whole sky to fly in like that guy.  Dang farmers I tell ya.  Start seeing by planes while on your combine people!
In theory it‚Äôs anyone who wants a Jewish state for protection of Jewish people from an oppressive majority. In practice it‚Äôs people that support the modern state of Israel and wish to continue its apartheid.
Yes, this guy was definitely complicit in downing people in cages and blowing up captives with artillery pieces like ISIS did. He's EXACTLY like ISIS by describing the horrible things he saw other people do ‚Äî as we can see in the video he's obviously very proud of what his comrades in arms didAre you about to tell me the things this 80 year old man saw justifies what Hamas did yesterday?
Honestly, even as someone who‚Äôs struggled with anger due to a complete lack of success with certain women post-college and with online dating in general, this level of vitriol is both baffling and more than a little frightening. Kinda seems like some of these guys were going to become monsters even if they had gotten laid a bunch of times. Just wtf.
It crazy that people defending those animals and say they laughing because they sad wtf the Media did to your Brian
Oof... I don't even know how to begin breaking the news for you. Maybe this infographic using UN's data:(I didn't save it dang it hold on I will go get it)EDIT: there it is, I feel like a dingus for not making sure I had it saved before.https://preview.redd.it/155j5doba3tb1.jpeg?width=1079&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=38499b09a132a9294f17701ac68aea242caf3550
Bruuh replace it with ISIS member and let see if you say the same
And even those that live in the country... not all of them support what it did and does to Palestinians, many just happen to have been born there. Just like not everyone who defends that Israel's crimes are recognized and punished, and that the Palestinians have their rights recognized and granted, supports what Hamas did yesterday. The concept of every human being having their rights protected and every form of violence against civilians should be condened shouldn't be a shocking hot take, yet here we are...
Jewish people who oppose Israel's past and present attrocities against the Palestinians aren't to blame for it, just like how US citizens who protested the many imperialistic actions of the country they live in are not to blame for them, just like how German citizens who (at least tried/died trying to) opposed Hitler or hid persecuted people in their homes aren't to blame for the Holocaust. People who did what was within their reach to protest and fight attrocities committed by their country, by an entity they are connected to by mere chance of location of their birth, are not to blame for those attrocities. They did their best to prevent them, and while it is a shame that many times their best wasn't enough, the blame it is not theirs, but of those that failed to oppose the attrocities or at least not support them.
He seemed disturbed by it all and is nervously laughing because that's what people do when they are uncomfortable.Also the timing of this upload? Is OP trying to justify what happened yesterday?
&gt;its not that he‚Äôs a bad personwell they did what they did, it's likely the bad person judgement comes from being a mass murderer of innocent women and children and who knows what else - the laughing is just the terrifying cherry on topim sure no one mandated they rape a 16 year old or take a flamethrower to citizens
ü§£ü§£
Watch Isreal commit more war crimes. Isreal is fucking üòà  most Americans know this!they stole Palestinians lands and slaughter them for decades now. It's disgusting!
The first one refers to the Tantura massacre 1948, [see the wiki article here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tantura_massacre)It's ironical that these guys ended the same way like the Nazis did only a few years before in WW2. The massacre could also have been carried out by some Waffen-SS units.But about the "joking", it's often a form of coping with humor. Met some WW2 vets and once i asked one about why he's joking about such a serious thing, he told me: "If i'd not joke about it and cope with humor, i'd go insane".But i also saw this in other cases, like when people talk about traumatic accidents, they are often not that much affected in the first place because they learned how to cope with it. Like my ex gf lost her leg in an accident and she has no problems to tell the story, it's not like that this would be a mental breakdown for her.Don't get this wrong, i don't side with anyone in this conflict there. It's always wrong to kill civilians and also POW's, soldiers that surrendered and didn't fight anymore.

Terrorist
Bro I can't stand religion 99.9999% of the time and I don't live in the never ending warzone sandbox so I could care less who actually "owns" it. I didn't even know what "Zionist" meant until 2 seconds ago when I just googled it. That being said hop off of the "supporting Hamas terrorism" dick. It's not a good look. Regardless of who it is, doing that shit to civilians is not acceptable. Anyways if this was about Palestinian women it would be just as bad. Hate towards any group of people based solely on their nationality, religion, sexuality, race, etc is never okay.
No, but people on the left have already defended Hamas.
This has nothing to do with pro or against Palestine. Go to Twitter and see US and isaezli politicians calling for genocide. This post is pure hatred for women, they would say the same any women victims in any part of the world.What an effing strawman you throw, zionist!
Thank you for the explanation!
people use humor to mask trauma. its not that he‚Äôs a bad person, its that it‚Äôs easier to laugh at the unimaginable evil you, a soldier, were used for, than to confront them. humor got me through afghanistan but i‚Äôll lie if i say i dont cry about it too.
Fucking rabid animals. Put them down
Obviously the harvester should have moved out of the way.
&gt;Also isn't every single Jew in the world afforded Israeli citizenship? All they need is a plane ticket. Doesn't that make all the Jews somewhat implicit in Israel's pretty brutal treatment of the Palestinians?Your logic makes no sense. While every Jewish person is eligible to become an Israeli citizen, it's important to recognize that not all of them necessarily want to live in Israel or support the idea of the country.
The original post image is the most fucked up shit ive ever seen in my life. holy fucking shit.
Play stupid games ‚Ä¶
No, that's hummus. Hamass is a car that is really bad with fuel economy.
Harrassment
Reminds me of interviews with japanese ex-soldiers that commited atrocities back in WW2. They were the exact pos that did it and not talking about their comrades. They were laughing and smiling while talking about it with glee.Unrelated but there was a post on reddit that is a screenshot of a post written by one of the pos that tortured Junko Furuta. The pos is alive and active on social media like the rest of us as if it did nothing wrong because of ties with the mafia, and the post was about the pos trying to justify its actions.
If it's any consolation, each and every one of them will die alone.
To them, any woman who isn't a viable sexual outlet is already worthless.
Nothing terrifying about some make believe religious ghosts
Ex-Israeli soldier describes atrocities committed against Palestinians.  New headline
No, I'm not. You're telling me, who has never been to Israel and never wants to, that I'm responsible for the fucking IDF? Yes, that's an antisemitic opinion. Own it or self-reflect.
I think you are just trying to do character assassination to my reddit account because you very strongly disagree with me. Wouldn't you say all Americans are at least somewhat implicit in the war crimes we committed from like Vietnam up? I do definitely. Once we figured out weapons of mass destruction were a lie in Iraq for example, anyone still on board with it is partially guilty. edited for context
No, it doesn't. Happy to help, and you seem to think things about yourself that aren't true. 'All Jews are responsible for Israel' is like, Antisemitism 101, up there with 'they're all rich'.
"You're better off askin Ariel Sharon for compassion, you're better off beggin for 20 points from a label, you're better off battling cancer under telephone cables" - Immortal Technique
They (the Israelis) regularly brutalize the population, cut utilities like power and water, bulldoze homes with people in it, the works. Truly criminal stuff. Almost like what a lot of Jewish populations suffered themselves through history.
hey I'm not some rabid anti Semite, I'm just saying its funny when the shoe is on the other foot. Also isn't every single Jew in the world afforded Israeli citizenship? All they need is a plane ticket. Doesn't that make all the Jews somewhat implicit in Israel's pretty brutal treatment of the Palestinians?
Oh mate, look up the life and times of Ariel Sharon if you're a 'big supporter'.
'The Jews' are not Israel and Israel is not 'The Jews', but I can tell you are really keen on this theory.
Backstory? Were these people ever investigated for war crimes? I'm a big supporter of Israel - but I thought this type of thing is not tolerated. I know there are Israeli soldiers who have gone to prison for abusing Palestinians. This is just shocking.
You don't harm them, they are currency for return of hostages.
&gt; If it's not listed on search engines it's technically dark web.lol
And yet the American political left is the ones that support it while the "Nazi" right seems to support Israel. Ironic isn't it. Accuse others of that which you do. But yet again the left is allowed to be antisemitic ie. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Talib still being allowed to be in Congress while being a rampant anti Semite
go on telegrAm type in hamas
To incels, women aren't even people. They are just soul sucking daemons that look down on the "least desirable" and therefore are oppressing them. Or at least that's one way I've interpreted incels
Not even a residential tower... fuck off. You can't punch a tiger and expect it not to bite you. Those that want this to end need in palestine need to demonstrate their resistance to terrorist Hamas or just get away from the buildings because the bombing is going to happen no matter what now.
Nah he‚Äôs just faking it
Since war was declared, it looks like a bunch of spies to me . Not a uniform among them. Therefore, it is not subject to the Geneva convention.  So hanging wouldn't be off the table. Probably will be traded for hostages......after their biometric data is taken. Isreal will know 100 percent in the future who to have mossad visit . I have seen photos of the celebrations in Gaza . Palestinians of all ages rejoicing.  That removes all doubt on any complicity.  Bomb it to rubble , push. the rubble into the sea . Trying to stop the peace between Saudi Arabia and Isreal is the real cause . Hamas cannot stand peace between Isreal and Arab nations. Anwar Sadat paid with his life before Hamas was even around when Egypt and Isreal signed a peace agreement. Hamas repeatedly cause bloodshed and carnage , get their asses kicked, then cry about the big bad jews.  Rinse and repeat over and over and over while dooming more generations of Palestinians to their death and hate cycle of violence. Most Arab nations have grown tired of the Palestinians due to the cost of supporting them continuously when they have had multiple chances at peace deals. The Palestinians spit in the faces of the peacemakers over and over. Could have had their own country, but nope. Gotta blame the jews and the west .  Accountability to their own people is more troubling than causing a war. May the fires of blind rage and hatred consume hamas and lead them to absolute destruction.
That not how that works, at all. And I literally googled the name in the header shown in the screenshot, scrolled down a bit and there it was.
That poor Caprice
There are some women who are IDF soldiers who‚Äôve been captured and tortured. That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm getting at. I don‚Äôt know whether any the women in these pictures specifically are soldiers. I was just giving the context of what‚Äôs going on right now.
From what I've learned it means believing that there should be a Jewish state
tism but a scratch!
From what I understand a zionist is a person who believes that Isreal is the destined homeland of Jews and the promised land too them based on the Torah. My Uncle who works for the ADL has said that it also is that it advocates to give all Jews a homeland and the revival of Hebrew.For some reason now if you are anti zionist so say you don't support the state of Isreal you are labeled anti zionist and even antisemitic. I'm not a person who supports Isreal or Palestine so I'm labeled as anti zionist but I fully support the Jewish people, I love my cousins who live in Isreal. Also zionist has become more extreme to mean the promised land.
I'm not finding the site on Google and my VPN is set to Albania... If it's not listed on search engines it's technically dark web.
This makes me feel sick
Depends on what the Pysops is for . Information is currency . Many Russians took the propaganda tactic and mastered it and used it to spread outside of western media into Africa  Palestine and other nations like Syria Egypt to persuade people . . One would have access to a wide variety of information as it is all around you without asking lol
Seems like a good way to make more terrorists, to shell residential towers.
I don‚Äôt mean this to be glib or cold but reality. I really doubt the life will be long unless Israel is willing to make real compromises, which I don‚Äôt see happening.
I didn't even bother to read the fine print. I didn't need all that nonsense in my head. I'm just going to assume there's some extremely stupid people in that chat.
Pls tell me the thing sticking out of his leg is his shin guard.
The savages deserve no less
Good
You're part of the bigger problem
I‚Äôm shocked that Isreal doesn‚Äôt allow its citizens to be armed. If there was ever a citizenry that should all have AR-15s it is this one.
The US and Israel are the same.. Isreal wouldn't be shit without the US to back them up.
They are chanting their identity and reason for doing this.
They had it coming.. after years of oppressing.
Nice bastards go splat
So u want a holocaust.. isn't that ironic coming from a jew?
Terrorism. Wtf are you talking about you idiot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Your asking for a holocaust.. if that's the way you think, Isreal needs to be wiped off the map
Let's ship them to the colonial times
All of these women are cuvillian who were dancing in a peace party...None of them are IDF soldiers. They are saying that to get simpathy from people.The truth is they slaughter kids with their moms on Israel soil, and took hustage babied and women.They raped and lynched schoolgirls who attended this party and slaughter more than 1000 cvillians in their brutal attack
As someone who knows the situation well and is a pro-Palestine person, i agree. Fuck hamas.
Will pave the streets of Gaza with the blood of anyone who took part in this.They party now, but soon they'll have to bury anyone they know over the ruin of their homes
It's just they never left high school, mentally, so they feel most comfortable on these 90s/ early 00s style BBS forums. Downvotes hurt they feewings:(
Is this #FreePalenstine?
First of all, female Israelis are more badass than they are. Secondly, how heartless must one be to celebrate the loss of SEVERAL CIVILIANS AND PEOPLE DEFENDING THEIR HOMES?
Shoot them in the head and walk away
Beautiful Caprice!
yes however being a professional futbol/soccer player at 35, then experiencing an injury of this caliber is undoubtedly career ending
When you go to grab his ankle all you're left with is the sock.
Dumb fucks
My bad that was poorly worded thank u for bringing it to my attention I edited it now
every time they know about a peace deal between saudi and Israel you see something like that happens.two weeks ago MBS talked about a major peace improvement between saudi and Palestine and israel, i'm not surprised.
I hope your teapot lifting arm was interrupted
The only one kidnapping and raping are Hamas
Death.
is there a lucky injury?
Yeah? I just said it because the whole people getting angry over it being called soccer vs football is stupid. They‚Äôre the same thing depending on where you are. I‚Äôm so sick of it online. Just respect each others terms and your love for the sport. Really isn‚Äôt that hard. Not saying you in particular are at fault here just makes me angry in general.
hamas is not afraid of us.  They are afraid of Israel.  That‚Äôs the giant they fafoing with.
so the civilians had it coming for the crimes of their military???
Your god isn't going to be so great when he fails to protect you from the wrath of the IDF.  I would be surprised if there is a man of gun toting age left in Gaza when this is over.
Hamas launched missiles on Israel and Israel declared war and its devolved into all out combat on the streets where innocent civilians are taking the full brunt of itI saw a video yesterday where Hamas kidnapped this girl and it looked like they cut her achilles tendon to stop her from fleeingIt is honestly barbaric
Hamas launched an invasion of Israel recently and have been taking women who are IDF soldiers, or just non Palestinian civilians and raping them, murdering them, and parading their corpses through the streets as part of their Jihad against Israel.
Some of them are IDF soldiers. Most are civilians. The first girl with the dreads was a German tattoo artist who was there for a concert. She‚Äôs not even Israeli.
A lot of leftists have been defending Hamas‚Äôs actions in the past two days. You can see it all over Reddit.
heals wayyy faster than a torn acl.. had kinda the same and was back ok the field 3 months - acl took me about 11 months to get back to 80-90%
&gt; thats because 3/4 years before that, the whole world said"hey, you know all those jews that are left in Europe that survived the war? why don't we give them their own country in the desert surrounded by arabs who have been there for thousands of years and hate their guts!" Most Israeli Jews are not Ashkenazi and have no historical connection to Europe, so you're wrong.  Most Israelis descend from Jews who were expelled from Arab countries following '48. Their own family history of oppression is at the hands of Arabs.&gt; palestine is a open air prison like a ghettoGaza is not an "open air prison" or a ghetto. It's under blockade by both Israel and Egypt, just like Japan was under US blockade during World War II. And it's under blockade due to hostile activities against Israel and Egypt, not just because like the Warsaw Ghetto.
And she was at a music festival and NOT a soldier. Fucking morons don't fact check for shit.
Anything for a red card
He's suffering. It's for his own good.
Those Hamas are nothing else then ISIS - instead of fighting an Army they choose to take civilians and children hostage, rape and kill them because of "religion"  and what not When I see this I am actually tending to be fine with Israel leveling Gaza once and for all - I really dislike Israel's settlement politics and the handling of the conflict  but I have not seen Israel's soldiers capturing civilians, kids and raping and killing them - that's just a different level of evil what those Arabic "soldiers" do
Oh god, will they have to put him down?
Not MCL, I tore my MCL and was back running in 3 months.ACL is completely different however.
It is a fucked leg though and if horses taught me anything it is that you are wrong about this poor lad.
I literally just heard that the US is stationing amphibious assault ships as well as other marine corps assets.
As if they survive, tell get beaten to death and raped - just like what is does
Why are those women dying? I don't feel like reading what those lowlifes are saying so I was hoping someone knows what's happening
The first girl is German bruh
Rub some dirt on it.
Broke my leg that way last year, check my post history to see images
I had this exact injury last year 1st og August. Look my post history and you can see images of it. I had two surgeries, one to stabilize as both Fibula and Tibia had snapped. The other surgery was to insert 15 screws and a metal plate. After 4 months of training my foot/leg back up,' I was able to start working again as carpenter.
Aren't they conscrits ?
Terrifying?
No, you wouldn't. Acl/mcl recovery time is over 10 times longer and more painful and challenging.
can you not read the 1st post? ofc you cant.
I like the creativity!!
They are such idiots. Let‚Äôs nip at the giant‚Äôs ankle.
Getting older sucks. All those little injuries I had over the years are hanging in the shadows waiting to let me know they are still there.
I checked and it's actually allowed but it's pretty rigorous
I have a messed up wrist from skating when I was a kid and arm wrestling is one thing I never do anymore. Whenever I get challenged I just gotta suck it up and hand them the W lol. I can't hit heavy punching bags either or it feels like my wrist is gonna explode.
This is what Palestine supporters want.Palestine supporters are cheering all around the world.
What monsters do this?
Damn
Incels are horrible for this but also at the same time didnt like israeli soldiers commit countless atrocities against women and kids they kinda had it coming. Funilly enough these "terrorists" have been told to protect women/children and churches which the IDF has not done like at all in their history of being "friendly" to palestinians
not just one, multiple
Oh so brave
Let the buzzards have at them.
What do you expect? Incels are a waste of oxygen. No saving them
Not bad luck I dont think. Healthy bones dont just break like that. Something was going on and it was time to rest or retire.
Time to send these people to hell
Most of them. As I just said.
I've also seen just pro Palestine anti Israel people in general saying almost the same shit in the last day or so. People are so anti Israel that they have lost all connection to reason or humanity
Moving the goal posts??? Sorry, which English majority country besides the UK calls it ‚Äúfootball‚Äù first and foremost?
Look at you moving the goal posts. Impressive
Bro, the core anglosphere ‚Äî Australia, Canada, New Zealand, US, UK, Ireland ‚Äî the UK is the only one of those countries that primarily uses ‚Äúfootball‚Äù. That is 90%+ of the English majority world.The UK is the only large English majority country where ‚Äúfootball‚Äù would predominantly refer to soccer.So yes, that is absolutely true‚Ä¶
Ahh, the bay area

They don‚Äôt get to go to heaven in there culture if they come into contact with pigs at all. There fighting Israel on a religious level.
lol nazis arent even the most evil regime in RECENT history. see Mao and Stalin.  \&gt; The Palestinian population has risen at a greater rate than the Israeli population since 1960.  thats because 3/4 years before that, the whole world said   "hey, you know all those jews that are left in Europe that survived the war? why don't we give them their own country in the desert surrounded by arabs who have been there for thousands of years and hate their guts!"   palestine is a open air prison like a ghetto....who else had ghettos for the undesired people of the time?
These types of injuries happen a few times every season. Usually it's from heavy contact in a bad tackle though, not from rolling over your own ankle.
You're not a professional athlete so your opinion doesn't matter much
What is with the whole, feed them to pigs thing? I keep seeing this.
Is he ok üò¶
If you watch the replay he ran his foot off - ankle down.
It‚Äôs almost as if different parts of the world speak different languages
No I don't. I see clips on Reddit other apps but they seem to about the player overreacting and faking being hurt. This one is nasty one tho.
This is not true at all.There are 13 countries on the planet that use soccer as a term *at all*. Some, if not most, primarily use football. I can tell you right now, there are a lot more than 13 English majority speaking countries.
ah the tolerant left at it again.
You can‚Äôt?  I‚Äôm able to see limbs flying off on one of the clips.
I know but I want to see them destroyed clearly
Oh continuous footage of the building dropping, let me the "professional photographer" F up the shot.
Wtf? These incels have made a fckin website
[nope](https://incels.in/index.php)
Start feeding the Hamas terrorists to pigs and they will never cross the boarder again.
Picture gaza as a DMZ.
It‚Äôs IR. Lots of naval and air use it as it works in both day and night.
Nobody is defending Soviet war crimes, but comparing Israel to Nazi Germany, aside from being factually wrong, is also antisemitic.There are no death camps, gas chambers, genocides, ghettos, millions of dead or anything comparable in the Israel-Palestine Conflict. The Palestinian population has risen at a greater rate than the Israeli population since 1960. The Nazis are considered the most evil regime in history because they slaughtered ~11 million people in death camps and concentration camps and started a war that killed ~60 million people on the European continent.The Nazi comparison is deliberately chosen out of a wide range of other, more accurate possible historical comparisons, in order to weaponize Jewish history in general against the Jewish state. It is using an ethnic group's history to attack them; it is the very definition of racism.
Hey buddy!
The broken foot was the standing leg not the one that got hit
Something tells me you don't watch the sport.
If you want a team in the PL I would suggest Brighton or Brentford. Stay away from United, it's not worth it.
those fuckers are sick... and need 5.56 jesus
I just wanna know can he play again!!?
OUCH!
They need American wallet for that
It looks like a forum on the dark web , correct me if I'm wrong
As a person that supports Israel, this just hurts me
Lack of calcium.
80 years ago the red army also raped and killed innocent people does that mean we should have cheered for nazi germany ? War itself is evil and everything that comes from it is evil but alas violence begets violence
What's even worse for these oxygen thieves is that even their hands fall asleep when they try to jerk off.
Gross. Lol
No winners in war.
Soccer players always over reacting.
Hope isreal goes full berzerk on these terrorists now
They always overreact, walk it off.
This is just a Kevin Hart skit..
they will brutally rape and killed her thats the priority of islam
even if that was the case, is there a single reason for celebrating or defending hamas in any way?
Oh, I'm the dumb one, got it. All good.
It wasn‚Äôt solid with the ground. It was dragging

Isreal has been displacing Palestinian people since 1947 with the help of the UN.  Taking their land and expanding their own borders. They are terrorists themselves.

I understand that someone can be angry about "not getting sex" or be angry with women, because all women have always been negative about such a person (I wonder why...).  But celebrating the death of a random girl from the other side of the world, whom you will never meet in life and who never had any plans in life for any relationship with such people? Disgusting
This is on grass
I liked Man U growing up because David Beckham was the only player I knew and he was cool as shit to 10 year old me. Now I guess would be the time to jump in since they are "bad" aka not winning the league every year, but it still feels like glory chasing. I always picked Leicester City in fifa because they were always the worst Premier League team and even as a kid I loved a rebuild. Had I known about promotion/relegation I'd have for sure gone to a lower League, but Leicester City has a special place for me from 10 years of fifa rebuilds, but with them relegated it's basically impossible to watch their games in the states. I dunno, I guess I'll keep watching every game I can until something jumps out at me. I love AEW so I might just go with Fulham to support Tony Kahn, although I know he's not the most beloved amongst Fulham fans. Haha
Aaaaaaand watchlist.
Bet that changes now?
AstroTurf needs to be BANNED.
Hope beat to death? Then strung up on the border to rot
Wipe the place off the Map, apparently the regular people enjoy these mfer's hanging around, just rebuild better.
I'd much rather blowout my ACL than have any kind of compound fracture.
These people can be seen and will be hunted down
I hope hamas enjoys themselves now. There won‚Äôt be a building left in Gaza
Ohhhh, Samsonite! I was way off
Boats and hoes
They wake up the Beast
The hell is wrong with them. I hope they are on a list somewhere.
Do you mean hummus?
Just chose whichever team you enjoy watching the most and brings you the most passion for the sport. When I really got into it a few years ago was peak liverpool days so I've stuck with them since then
Despicable.

It‚Äôs almost as if different parts of the world call things differently. Shocking.
Wtf.
yet another football player faking and overacting
Disgusting. Fuck hamass
Why did the camera man decide it was a nice time for a full zoom ass shot?
No arguments here. I wish I had known how much I liked soccer (football) earlier. It's been a ton of fun, but picking a team has been a bit more difficult than I expected.
Magic spray and run it off?
I think people who don't watch don't realize just how physical the sport actually is. I only recently started getting into the Premier League as a dumb yank and was actually really surprised. A lot of the "flops" fans are yelling to walk it off still look like they hurt like shit. Haha.
They don't have a second amendment like the U.S.. They do have mandatory military services so most of the nation knows how to shoot a rifle. And I think there will be a call to arms coming soon but I pray for peace.
Ahh no wonder why it‚Äôs called foo..wait
What was the purpose of this? Was it a military target or revenge? This was an IDF air strike. Correct me if I'm wrong please. I pray for peace üôè.

All those arm wrestling breaks have nothing to do with preexisting fractures, but torsional forces applied to the bone. Bones aren't meant to twist, and that's what's happening in the typical arm-wrestling arm break.
Let me guess he‚Äôs italian?? (I am italian dont yell at me)
When asked what he think caused the injury, Basham replied, "I'm stumped ..."

Believe it or not, usually this type of injury heal a lot faster than ACL rupture
Yes
They even called up reservist so expected a full scale invasion to cleared out Hamas for good.
Well, working with women might have skewed your data, bit I wouldn't rule out that, but minor fractures go untreated often. I know a guy who fell of a deck and fuccked himself up. He got an ambulance ride and full x-rays. No new breaks but there was an old healed fracture on a vertebra.Oh yeah... he said. I remember that.Some of the nastiest arm wrestling breaks I have seen were attributed to earlier spirals on the humorous.

With all the dramas around diving, when injuries do happen, they are probably one of the gnarliest.
&gt;In soccer especially turf just does not allow the players to play at a high level given you can‚Äôt get under the ball as well too.Well in American football you don't have to get under the ball with your foot.
One of the Liverpool players will get a red card for it.
I mean it makes sense we call football-soccer because American football was around before uk football was introduced to the united states .
The British empire started using ‚Äúsoccer‚Äù in the first place
Does anyone know the timeline for an injury like that and what procedure they‚Äôd do to fix it/help it heal?!
How tf does that happen I mean seriously. I‚Äôve played soccer for 13 years and never have seen someone break their ankle on their plant foot.
Yea in soccer in Europe it‚Äôs basically illegal to use turf - it‚Äôs actually nuts the NFL uses turf when they are the most profitable league in the world. In soccer especially turf just does not allow the players to play at a high level given you can‚Äôt get under the ball as well too.
You've got a 33 trillion dollar debt mate... you now pay more back in interest on that than you do on your military every year. üëçüèª
are Israelis citizens not armed?
Came to say this to mate! UTB
The greater majority of the arm wrestling breaks are with women, I‚Äôve worked closely with womens rugby and those kinda breaks have nothing to with fractures and everything to with a complete lack of calcium in thier diets. Also it looks more like a clean snap off the ankle and it is, the foot has come all the way detached from the leg.
His ankle just wanted to wave to the crowd.
Holy shit a soccer player who went down for a legit reason.
The British Empire once controlled a quarter of the landmass of Earth from our little island. We were the original superpower, you absolute muppet.Feel special when you're the only country on Earth where you call it soccer?

I was there in the crowd today. Very sickening to see. Lots of people gasped and you could hear Bash screaming.

All those arm wrestling breaks we see are mostly due to preexisting fractures. 35 shouldn't give a healthy pro athlete bone loss issues... but strikes from over the years takes their toll. Shin pads were an afterthought. After legs got broken thought.

At least he no longer has to question whether or not to retire

I always laugh when these people say "it says so, right in the Bible" to back their claim, like that isn‚Äôt just also written by some dead men and is archaic bs.
That's just dirt
Keep in mind that not all Christian‚Äôs or religious people are like this and most are not. Atheists have done very messed up things too.
The spiritual war in general is prosecuted to pull God‚Äôs people away from Him. Demonic oppression and demonic possession are two different things, enacted on God‚Äôs people as acts of war. What exactly do you need clarification on?
According to Christian tradition (which is all we have to go on because the contemporary understanding of possession is extra-biblical) Satan's spiritual war against God's people is done specifically to sow doubt and win souls to hell.  That is the end game.  If you disagree, I'd be interested in seeing the proof of your argument.
Unbelief doesn‚Äôt make you a demon, nor is that anything close to what I stated
It‚Äôs not about making the believer specifically doubt, it‚Äôs about waging war on God‚Äôs people. That is all
Do you often support violence against women? Or just Jewish women? Despite your denials, that is what you‚Äôre doing.
All in the name of some god. So dumb. Israel is going to respond to this. Jets and bombs.
I mean it's totally not justified to launch a bunch of bombs at specifically civilian areas because of a military attack by non those civilians
They are being sodomized, this is terrifying
&gt;They deserve what‚Äôs coming.Why didnt u say the same when Israel killed the innocents people since forever?Im not saying that it is OK to kill innocents people but supporting Israel is defenitly not the right thing to do
Yeah, if one thing has been proven, Israel doesn‚Äôt fuck around.
I mean seriously, what do people expect? Sometimes I just have a feeling that this must be a CIA setup, like tinfoil hat conspiracy stuff. And that's because I refuse to believe that people are so dense to go against the IDF, with their pesky and primitive equipment and hope for something better than being disintegrated.Sure you can wrap a fan onto a paraglider and put 2 mfs and send it to murder an Israeli village. But that's just as far as it gets. May the actual innocent families and children in Gaza be spared from the hellfire that will follow.

They basically don't see them as human.
Oof. Wait till you hear about the other side‚Ä¶.
Poor girl
Where are all Palestine protectors ? Where are you ? What happened?
As a Muslim, I‚Äôm afraid to rear my head around here and get bashed for no reason
Their position to take back what they believe is theirs may be considered justified to some, but acts like these can never be considered so.Scorch their fucking earth.
this will not end well for the Palestinian cause.
That was my first thought when I saw that too. Horrific.
I mean it's kinda the whole reason they don't like each other.
And their interpretation of the Quran It's okay to kill infidels.
This comment section is something else‚Ä¶
People who loose their homes become homeless. I see it all the time where I live. Thank God they don't think like you and figure that kidnapping, torturing and SA is ok. I hope you find the help you need.
They sure seem oppressed.
We're surrounded by atheists! Run!
And that includes kidnapping and raping civilians?
this is why the aliens don't fuck wit us
Fucking horrible situation. The extremist of the world always get the innocent caught in their crosshairs
Bile, bilirubin and red blood cells make poop brown. The seat of her pants could be any and more than those substances. Poor thing. My stomach hurts for her.
Things that never happen.
Dude no one should be doing anything to anyone. If you support the harm of innocent civilians - especially women and children. I don‚Äôt give a shit what side you are on.
Then comes the salt
Why? This woman's life, her capture,  the ransome, the demands...not worth it. They know what's coming? I get that this is a very deep, very complex issue, but i think the best coarse for change could start with the civilians on each side. They shouldn't tolerate this kind of shit, and civilians on both sides need to stop retaliating against government issued strikes. A city of people can easily say "no, your going to get your self, us, and our children killed, let her go" and just to be clear I can assure you I fully understand that the citizens of Israel also have unnecessary blood on their hands as well.It's so frightening what humans are capable of in large crowds. Especially angry crowds
GOD BE WITH HER.
There is none. But the minute you "they" a group of people, you're just doing what everyone else does. That's the problem with all of this. Besides the actual violence.She's a "they" to those folks and she did nothing wrong most likely.So what will happen now is "they" (ie, whoever is in the area... innocent alike) will feel the wrath of the IDF, and after the dust is cleared "they" will gather together and say "let's get THEM" meaning anybody who is Jewish.It won't end until everyone decides that punishing an entire group of people isn't the answer.
Honestly there's a non-zero chance they just level the strip. Launching a genocidal attack against a more powerful country is beyond stupid (never mind one that experienced genocide in living memory). They may just go eye for an eye on this. I'm very worried for civilians on both sides right now.
I agree üíØ
Nope sure don't. Canada is a bunch of pansies and Mexicos military is a joke the cartel is the threat lol. Palestine is a terrorist disgusting shit hole. But the biden administration has pushed us to he apologetic for those bastards while Isreal has dealt with this shit for decades. And nothing has been done to help them. Isreal is demonized in the US.
What are you talking about? Since when does Canada use military force to expand their borders?
Exactly! Now lets see how atheist China is doing:&gt;Documented human rights abuses include coercive population control methods, forced labor, arbitrary detention in internment camps, torture, physical and sexual abuse, mass surveillance and family separation.
Go back to school please. It was Ottoman Empire before it became occupied territory which then turned into the official British mandate Palestine. There has been no 'just Palestine'.
Or we know she is in the hands of terrorists that rape their prisoners. Israel will have there revenge.
Cuz they keep violently raping her...This whole situation is absolutely fucked at this point.
I chose Zeus, just for one time, it's him who get fcked
IDF inbound with vengeance atm.
So I‚Äôm sorry if it was offense, it just brings out deep painful emotion seeing women suffer. I went off.
Sooo all that makes it ok for them to grab civilian women off the streets and rape, torture, and murder them??If you feel so strongly that they're doing the right thing, go help out. Nobody wants to listen to your bs here anyway.
Anything short of torture is too good for these piles of trash.
They are religious fanatics who want to kill Jews.. it won't be rainbows and sunshines if they were in power either
They are going to go scorched earth more than likely
There may be a time and place for your feminist rantings but this ain't it chief
IDF going to go ham on these dudes when, not if, they find them
It's funny how none of these ass fucks that are downvoting you cannot think any further than the first grade level. Let's completely forget about the fact that she was probably beaten and punched repeatedly in the gut and might have internal bleeding. Yes, she could very well be bleeding from her anus because she probably did let her stool go out of fear and probably peed herself at some point. Let's not forget that they probably raped her too which is very saddening.
Religion of Petes
Palestine lost its right to lands after they lost Yom Kippur war, in my opinion Israel was nice to give them there territory back even if they moving into it again.
"  I‚Äôm not saying it is justified "  It's entirely justified... FTFY
I mean, your not entirely wrong. The majority of Palestinians support murdering civilians. Further more the vast majority oppose a two state solution or any peace with Israel, where as majority of Israelis support a two state solution.https://pcpsr.org/en/node/938
The US does fund Israel. What are you talking about?
I would say she would prefer death instead of whats going to happen
![gif](giphy|Jl7lrsWPDBJPRO4jKu)
Tell you what, if your scat looks like that you should probably see a doctor. In the meantime I‚Äôd recommend a shrink.
NO FUCK THAT. My extreme female supremacist days come tumbling back when I see men grabbing women and kidnapping them like this. I know that these men are literally intimidated by women, and cannot stand the power we hold. Men must try to strip our power from us, before we all get together and start absolute inhumane torturous violence on them, created from the years and years and fuckinh YEARS these men belittle us, rape us, assault us, take from us, scare us, behead us for doing nothing, and making us feel like we are bound to a life of simple procreate and die. That‚Äôs not the life. Stop kidnapping women because you fear our power. You men must realize you hold no power deep down if you feel the need to always place so much control over the womanly body‚Ä¶? You‚Äôll never be as physically capable as women. Ok ok you can lift things. We make, create, and birth babies. Then those babies rely on us after birth. A lot of women prefer no man in the picture, and want to just get sperm out of the scenario of possible! But if sperm is a must..most prefer to just sigh ‚Äúfiiine..‚Äù and go to a nice, reputable facility that helps women get preg using sperm donor‚Äôs sperm. No strings attached. No man in the picture. Because men control control control. Harm harm harm. Women you are beautiful.
&gt;Fuck the gods  I choose Aphrodite
her bum is bleeding
That‚Äôs the color of blood, not feces.
That's her being injured or shot
‚ÄúSettlers‚Äù directly attack, kidnap, and kill peaceful civilians? They go house to house and deliberately slaughter innocent civilians house by house?
You must have been living under a rock the past decades, don‚Äôt you? Settlers are targetting civilians daily, with support and approval from the IDF.
The amount of blood pretty much confirms it.
I agree with you about one thing: only when the entire area is one state, whether it is Israel or a new entity, will there be peace. As long as there are two states, peace will not come.
And twitter
Give me at least one reason to kidnap and kill civilians who justified it
*all religious leaders
i think chances are she's just been bleeding a lot and the blood dropped down to wherever she has been sitting and soaked into her pants. As someone who has a period, it's not THAT much blood. i mean praying it wasn't due to SA that's absolutely disgusting, the fact she is so bloody is disgusting to begin with i feel awful for her
Interesting how Palestine directly targets civilians when they attack while Israel doesn‚Äôt, yet some people in the west still choose to support Palestine over Israel. I‚Äôm not aware of Israel ever deliberately attacking a civilian target (hospitals that the Palestinians launch rockets off of don‚Äôt count)
Idk if unwarranted was the right word but it was sudden and unexpected. That's all.
Although it‚Äôs possible I find it much more likely that amount of blood is from some sort of trauma; especially with the history of rape and treatment of women in those areas. Being a woman who has bled regularly for most of my life, that is a *lot* of blood to just be menstruating.
Definitely justified.
They are graping these women, no doubt about it.
I really don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs what their god wants
Big brave men‚Ä¶‚Ä¶
Time to completely end Palestinian unprovoked violence. This nonsense has gone for way tooLong. Both West Bank and Gaza needs to be taken completely by Israel.Love to Israel from India üáÆüá≥
I don't think she will live long sadly. Haven't you seen the other video of a woman who was dead and was naked , her femur has broken into 2 parts ??
Well possibly, if your religion labels women as lesser beings there to serve men only.
I‚Äôm jealous of your naivety
Something tells me it's a 2 sided issue and Israel is far from innocent
It is probably menstruation
She knows she's dead.
You got downvoted, but it is very possible and also sucks a lot. It means she's not being allowed to maintain her personal hygiene, which can be very problematic in a longterm hostage situation.
Bullshit.Gullible, violent men and the grifters who feed them religion.All the men in this video are worthless pieces of religious shit.
Yeah, like a college student who rapes an unconscious woman at a party. The root is religion...lol
OMG how absolutely horrifying that poor woman üò≠
Let's be honest, no matter what side lay its arms down, there will never be peace.
Menstruation?
This is probably more political than religious
C. All of the above
If Palestine were to lay down its arms, there would be peace there. If Israel laid down its weapons, they would be massacred.Time for diplomacy is long over.. time for bombing these Hama,s shit finally out of Gaza
waiving the pistol at his guys
Still happening today. New stories pop up every once in a while. Ask Jeeves.

Gaza launched an unwarranted attack on Israel who responded with force. Hundreds have already perished.
As they should.
SCUM
Fill you in??
can anyone fill me up on what's going on?
Like for a ransom or just to torture?
Look at all the blood soaking through the seat of that poor woman‚Äôs pants. Think about why she‚Äôs be bleeding from those areas. They deserve what‚Äôs coming.
* The last days of Gaza. Goodbye.
Israel will be retaliating in a massive way after what happened today. It won‚Äôt just be ground troops. It will be armor and jets. The hornets nest has been kicked. I‚Äôm not saying it is justified but this will be the reaction. There is no way they will use diplomacy.
Religious scum.
Stop posting garbage like this
Favored targets. If you already don‚Äôt believe in God then there‚Äôs nothing more for them to do - you‚Äôre already condemned alongside the demons. You‚Äôve already done their work for them
How long ago was this, and where?
Hi, Jack.
Kamel Amin Thaabet was Cohen‚Äôs alias. Syrian officials found out he was a spy because they traced radio signals back to Cohen‚Äôs apartment.
It's already been said but it's terrifying that people are still deluded enough to give religion any credence. They're death cults of abuse and exploitation and it enrages me.
Lmao it‚Äôs a mystery why only religious get possessed
Idk if this is the one [maybe](https://youtu.be/l78hW8qVIWI?si=pH7XLwe7h7L4XCXb)
do you have a link? i can‚Äôt find it, please
Preach on!
What I find terrifying is how many people were misdiagnosed with being "possessed" and subsequently tortured to death by these "holy men", when in reality they had some sort of mental illness. Ignorance and superstition are extremely dangerous and terrifying when they lead the actions of people in positions of authority.
The scary thing is that they torture clearly deeply mentally ill people with a bunch of religious nonsense that often times makes them worse.
Very much indeed.
What's truly terrifying is that people believe this kind of crap is real.
"all the sex toys in the room turn on and start hovering"
Apartheid state
That‚Äôs how they all sound. Repetition of the same idiotic slogan. In other terms, you‚Äôre being confidently incorrect when you *really* shouldn‚Äôt be.
LMAOOO favorite comment on the thread, right here.
Your anti-semitism is showing
OK anti semite
They are settlers, literal colonists. They aren't simple civilians being attacked.
Ridiculous. I can hate America and not hate Americans. Your ethno state is showing.
Me and my issues are not the topic here ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)Watch the terror attack in the video, this is the topic.1. What do you think of the terror attack in video?2. Can you prove it is fake and didn't happen yesterday?Anything else I don't care, me and my issues, we don't care.
I hate you for being a worthless piece of anti-semitic shit, is that clear enough for you?
Ah this dude again, the conflict happening in the middle east and especially in that area is complex and definitely not one sided. Both Palestinians and Israelis are at fault and at the same time the victims. Op is just an angry man trying to rile up one sided hatred against Palestinians. Op has some serious issues just check out his other content
I hate Israel for what they‚Äôve done to the Palestinians. Was that clear enough for you?
Well, it's good.In my area it's either IDF or ISIS.
No, that's not what we say.In Judaism we say: "Wisdom of the nations, learn from them"
Right, it seems like the IDF is in charge.
That‚Äôs what I think of the video and you
what's going on with the car that's recording this? (bottom left of the screen) it looks like they're shooting through the windshield

Palestinian population boomed when the Isreali jews showed up and started making the area more economically viable. If they were wiping out Palestinians, why does their population continue to rise?
It's not r/PublicFreakout here, you are confused, the jihad and the progressives do-gooders aren't in charge here as they are in there censoring according to their agenda.
Go watch Andrew Gold interview the Father.   It's an eye opener.
Lot's of IDF boot-licking propagandists in the comment thread.
Is the IDF going to go after the terrorists in their own ranks? The ones that have been murdering innocent people? Also, I wonder why this guy was angry enough at Israel to do something like this?
And what do you think of this video?
I‚Äôve seen worst from israel towards Palestine or others
The responses by Palestine supporters in this thread are very telling. Good job OP
Everyone here needs to watch Attack On Titan. You are all at step 1 of this discussion. AoT is on step 100. Covers this predicament/discussion with disturbing accuracy. Yes its an anime. An anime is a story. A story can reflect accurate/insightful information.
As a U.S. citizen this actually concerns me greatly, like where is the oversight, how come we send SO MUCH MONEY? It‚Äôs very odd. I just saw a news article where a Texas teacher was fired because she refused to sign a document that said she wouldn‚Äôt badmouth Israel. Odd odd odd
Yeah I got banned from there for saying all y‚Äôall post is death to Jews content. Meanwhile both sides make fools of themselves on the regular and can‚Äôt get along. There‚Äôs a point where it‚Äôs both sides fault and trying to pontificate on how horrid Jews are to Muslims in Israel falls flat.
From the "river" to the "sea" means to destroy Israel and not two state solution.When I hear you chant this bullshit and that you want to destroy my country, I will definitely fight for my independence. Anything else you learned to chant keyboard warrior?You play zero-sum game, everything or nothing.You got nothing so far.
Dashboard camera.
What is the other guy recording shooting from the car?
Says the Israeli fascist
Learn history, Israel got independence a few decades before the American aid and managed to defeat all Arab countries neighboring her all together and several times.With no aid.
First "Falsetinian" leader &amp; Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Ameen al-Husseini was a nazi and met with Hitler. He had an office and salary from the Nazi regime.https://encyclopedia.ushmm.org/content/en/film/hajj-amin-al-husayni-meets-hitlerHe eventually escaped from Jerusalem dressed as a woman ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)Current "Falsetinian" leader, Mahmoud Abbas is also a known holocaust denier who recently had a speech in Arabic about it.**That's Palestinian pro-nazi history in short.**I'm sure many people aren't aware of that but now they will learn how Falsetinian leaders support Nazism, just because you called Israelis "Nazis".
Violent jihadist, that's what you are.
And how many Palestinians murder Palestinians in clan clashes you know?So far 200 hundred this year only in Israel (Gaza and West Bank not included).
So does Israel. USA funding them with a lot of money. You guys are really comfortable with Benjamin taking those dollars and pretending Israel isn't killing hundreds of Palestinians. I wonder what the conversion is, but Israel is definitely killing more people than Palestine.
Not at all what he is saying.
Stupid take. Zion is poison to the children of tomorrow for Jews and others all over the world.

2 out of $3 billion, Israel is obligated to purchase from American industries. The $1 billion is for technology development on Israeli side that is being shared with the US.For example, US sends $2 billion each year for Egypt yet you can't consider them as a democracy and as for alliance, they are now flirting with Russia....Funny right? Check all the countries that get aid from the US and tell me if they are democracies and what their alliance worth.
Ok. That's it.It's a bad thing which you condemn and also can't say it didn't happen.I also think it's a bad thing and glad that this terrorist is in hell now.Thank you.
i think the man in the video is doing something bad. that says nothing about whether or not you are a propaganda account (which you obviously are)yeah i didn‚Äôt say it didn‚Äôt happen, i said you‚Äôre a propaganda account lol. one look at your post history makes that obvious
&gt; Israel has a functioning democracy and individual libertiesFunny how that works when you got the US sending you billions in aid.
You can join Hamas or ISIS then.
Importantly to remember IDF terrorist families are also paid after their deaths.
Tell me you know nothin about Israel
Free Palestine from the xenophobic and bigoted Israelis
Coming from the Israeli propaganda machine on the internet, ouch hurts so much
Another keyboard warrior ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)
Fuck Israel. Apartheid hypocritical cunts
Free Palestine from Hamas terrorists.They are not so different than ISIS.What a beautiful language you use.
Nope, some of us are also from countries that have been oppressed and killed by invading countries. Anyone who previously was owned by Britain for example.
Free Palestine get fucked
Hamas promotes the JQ and has stated their goal as removing Jews entirely from the region. Don‚Äôt get me wrong I don‚Äôt sympathize with the hardcore racist far-right Israelis who say the same thing about Palestinians. But let‚Äôs not pretend Hamas is a good thing.
I know many Jews that I love and I am glad that I have not met many people like you. Your arguments don‚Äôt makes sense asking for compassion based on hatred. Truly a Zionist for a cause that has nothing to do with your religion just based on colonization and oppression.
You don't want to answer, I wonder why?Happened yesterday, I didn't make this up. What do you think of it?
Car recording is also firing , they firing on the insurgent?
lmao why? if you are clearly a propaganda account that seems pretty relevant.
imagine murdering innocent people over a sky fairy
I have seen videos of jews spitting on Christian tourists and abusing nuns.
Blind propagandized idiots in this thread (and most of reddit, who are also mostly idiots go figure) who just say both sides are the reason palestinians will never find peace or justice. You pretend to care about peace and safety but all you want is revenge.Israel won already. There is no 'connection to the land' claim or anything like that in reality. Israel has a functioning democracy and individual liberties. Most of the middle east does not. Palestinians are responsible for almost all of the violence directed at them for the last two decades. If they put down their weapons, the war would be over.
Already here by the dozens lol.
FREE PALESTINE FROM OPPRESSIVE ISRAEL.
Israel has been doing it to Palestinians for a very long time too‚Ä¶
Leftists are fucking stupid
Reply what you think of the video, not me.
Zionist propaganda account not even trying to act like anything else.
Innocent lives are being lost on both sides. That‚Äôs typically how war works.
OP is biased
Ironically the fact that you can call Israel fascist while staying in Israel is a good indicator of a healthy democracy. Try calling out MBS, Ayatollah, Al-Assad or any other peaceful leader for what they are and see true fascism in action.
Can‚Äôt wait to see all the pro-Palestinian trash come out of the gutters to defend a literal terrorist.
Funny thing, fascist being the most popular description of Israel on Reddit, while by definition, Israel is the only non-fascist state in this whole region (with the exception of Lebanon)
Like Bernie Sanders.
Basically all reddit wants is - "israel-so-bad" postsIt's disgusting to see all these terrorist sympathisers commenting on israel being fascist and not one of them felt relieved that the Jewish family is safe and that the terrorist did not succeed. Long live Israel. Hope the Israeli forces helped this peaceful protestor to meet his peaceful Allah.
Sounds like projecting
Yeah, but if you point out the irony of their military industrial complex wiping out Palestinian people bearing an uncanny resemblance to some guy in Germany in the 1930/40s you're antisemitic ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Honey it‚Äôs time for your daily Zionist propaganda
So now me being jew is your problem? And you call me a genocidal prick?Reply to video not about me.I'm not sure if you're a neo-nazi or jihadist but you are the example of this collaboration on Reddit.Long Live Israel !
i just found out im banned from that sub LMAOooo
Explains the bias. Funny you wrote to end violence is to recognize it first,with you being a genocidal prick and all. Fuck Israel.
One man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter
This is the most despicable defense mounted by Israel supporters. Do you think North Korea is a good country? If not you‚Äôre racist. How about China? You think they are justified in everything they do? If not you‚Äôre racist. Do you think Palestinians attacking Israel with rockets is bad? If so, you‚Äôre a confirmed racist. So. What is it? Are you racist or a rabid supporter of NK and China? Has to be one or the other apparently, so choose.
Does that make you a minion of zionists? It‚Äôs weird to point the finger when you‚Äôre doing the same thing inverted. The hypocrisy over there is stunning.
Maybe you also remember how it was Gaza randomly shelling Israeli civilian that kicked the 2014 fight into gear : and how [Hamas was (yet again) deliberately firing from civilian areas](https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/09/hamas-quietly-admits-it-fired-rockets-from-civilian-areas/380149/) in order to dissuade Israeli counter-fire and create martyrs for their cause.
Thanks for your comment, I enjoyed reading it.I know that most Americans don't hate or support jihadists. Personally I appreciate American society and its contribution to the world with values of freedom, liberty and democracy. And it's clear who are those haters...
Best nation in the region, by far.
American here.  We‚Äôre not all lost to jew hating masked as ‚Äúfree Palestine‚Äù.   I appreciate your work and bringing attention to the other side of it because the buzz has devolved the past few years into ‚ÄúIsrael bad, Palestine good‚Äù.   Both parties have blame, just like both parties should exist in their own states eventually.  Many of these hateful replies to you are by people that don‚Äôt understand the history of the conflict nor the nuance of it.
99.9% of people that just "hate Israel" are using it as a poorly hidden dogwhistle that means "I hate Jews"
Commentsection is so toxic the walls are turning blue.
So you condone the killings of innocent Israeli families ?I don't think you hate Israel, I think you hate Jews.
Wow you must really hate Palestine.
&gt;Israel is an aparthied land grabbing facist genocidal racist state.Now do Palestine.
Yes.
Not only settlers, some people come to fix their car or other things.
I'm happy no one got hurt, but this happened in the West Bank and the people targeted were presumably settlers.
Condemn is what I meant lol. Why did English had to be this way? Two opposing words which can massively change the meaning of a sentence with similar sound and somewhat similar spelling :D
It's area in which both Israelis and Palestinians live. It's from Huwara 32.152217332555715, 35.25688504193543
What does an Israeli family do driving around in what looks like an Arab town? Where did this happen?
Bless you, don't let the haters stop you
Chdking
Almost ;).
Lots of people share your sentiment

It just annoys me because Mods are often genuinely fucking cowards, and while I'll still caveat saying even though that one mod was fucking useless I do give that dude a bit of respect for at least having the balls to reply to modmail. Mods can run their sub however they fucking like and I'm fine with that because I know that's how Reddit currently works, but FFS why are mods now such lazy fucks that can't even reply to modmail?
I posted there in good faith and was upvoted quite a lot, and then someone asked in one of those "Philly looting" clips why they always got locked and I'll just show you [a screenshot that of what I see](https://files.catbox.moe/irjq78.png) of what got me banned because, and I'd like to point out if you find that post it's locked like I prophesized to the degree of the sun rising tomorrow, if I deserved a perma I'm still interested in anybody's conclusion why as the mods there are illiterate or incapable of doing so. I get that mods run the show in subs, but for fucks sake at least have a backbone about it...I'd have accepted:&gt; Fuck you...we don't want you here.
I‚Äôm perma banned from there for a jokey comment. No warning, no reply from mods when I messaged twice asking why. They‚Äôre exactly the kind of mods people laugh at
99% of OP's posts are from r palestinian violence! You are lost mate and this is clearly a propaganda post.Regardless of the content of this video, which I ~~condone~~ condemn, Israel is an aparthied land grabbing facist genocidal racist state. It's a fact and without US's protection you would have been sanctioned to the oblivion for your war crimes. I remember 2014 assault on Gaza like it was yesterday where you butchered 500 kids in 40 days.
Not condoning anything but it‚Äôs become more and more apparent that a lot of the backlash is caused by the way the Orthodox Jews simply ignore the laws and shit on everyone else over there, whether they‚Äôre Muslim or catholic.   Maybe it‚Äôs time to address their contribution to the problem in an honest fashionAnd too clarify I‚Äôm not using any ‚Äòabsolute‚Äô statements and blaming every orthodox Jewish person, however if you don‚Äôt have the ability to step back and look at the continued back and forth then you should acknowledge your bias and be honest about it.   An innocent family driving in a car should not have to experience this, whether it‚Äôs in Israel or any other country.   The forced removal of families from their homes to provide room for expansion is repulsive - not a single person commenting would ever accept, stand for, or be happy if they were forcibly removed from their home bc someone else decided they want to live there.Edit 2:  well that literally escalated quickly.   What a shit show.
I think you're looking for the tilde.... this thing:~It's generally used to denote an author.
Sorry, my bad, I will delete my comment. As said, it's not my native tongue.Sorry again.
Huh? I was merely poking fun at how bad the gun man was in actually hitting his targets ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èThink about it, why would I even bring up "stormtrooper" if I was making fun of your grammar?
Damn I can spot a Hiab crane anywhere lol I need a vacation for real
If so, I'm sorry but that's what I understood, trying to laugh at the headline title.
This is not what he said.. it was not about you or your english
"no injuries reported"...My guy trying to audition for the stormtrooper role so bad
Correct, they have funds for dead terrorists and prisoners. Sick.
‚ÄúWe keep on being told that religion, whatever its imperfections, at least instills morality. On every side, there is conclusive evidence that the contrary is the case and that faith causes people to be more mean, more selfish, and perhaps above all, more stupid.‚Äù- Christopher Hitchens.
Important to keep in mind his family is paid for his death by the Martyrs for Jihad fund. So while he did die he has secured his family income for a long time.
Well I have a impractical fear of balloons. So I would like to believe he is running from a surprise party.
I‚Äôm sure he did on impact
Beyblade beyblade let it rip!
So what is the alternative? Just leave them on the streets to let them drink and drug themselves into even further psychosis? All while terrorizing regular productive members of society, destroying property, committing crimes, etc.?Institutions may not be the greatest of places to be but I am pretty sure they are better than sleeping under a bush or in a tent on the sidewalk.And think about it this way, we DO round up the mentally insane and put them institutions indefinitely. They are called prisons. But that only AFTER they have committed some terrible offense against an innocent person.Wouldn't it be better to do it BEFORE they destroyed some innocent lives?
Never late to work
A significant amount of Reddit has become convinced that all of our current problems with the mentally ill are solely the result of Reagan. This is a massively distorted understanding that just happens to be ideologically convenient for those making the argument.In reality, the de-institutionalization movement started decades before Reagan became president and was bolstered not only culturally with films like One Flew Over the Cuckoo Nest, pharmacologically with the advent of new anti-psychotic meds and also in multiple SCOTUS cases that made it much more difficult to involuntarily institutionalize people.

Thanks mane
Thanky you're very kind
Had to shit. Now he has to change his pants.
Him running full sprint after the crash made me laugh out loud in this public bathroom. Guy next to me thinks I‚Äôm laughing at him now. Fuck
I would quit right then and there fuck that
Good. Hope he caught some bodies.

How in the hell did he do that so smoothly???Peace
Ahhh Leuvehaven always a great placeüòÇ
He was actually doing this because the worstenbroodjes were almost sold out
Well, if their situations aren't improving, it's not like we could risk the public on them. One of my lecturers back in my college years saw an institutionalized man reformed into a contributing citizen. I believe he was either a cook or an owner of a restaurant in front of said mental hospital.
Not just TB. I frequented a decommissioned sanatorium for lepers back when I studied in Peninsular Malaysia. People in the West associate sanitarium with TB, but us Malaysians know the sanitarium is for all incurable diseases(back then).

Ey-oooh! I know where that is! I regularly go for bicycle rides past that very spot!
Probably running from the cops
Seriously, I'd rather the police shoot me on site then have to think about this even 30 minutes afterwards. It's crazy how there's people who just don't feel shame or have any integrity. I can't comprehend it and I'm far from some saint.
The title is perfect.  I laughed so hard when I saw him booking it on foot.It's short enough I feel like this should be gif-ized to use when a girl says her parents aren't home or something dumb like that.

That's because someone will pick you out of the video and label you a racist.
***NOBODY*** wants to say a goddamned thing that has one tiny, itty bitty, miniscule, fraction of a chance of being perceived as bigoted because *everyone* has a cell phone out and you never know when someone will capture you saying that and post a viral video of you being "racist/homophobic/transphobic/etc" at which point people will dox you and send the video to the company you work for and try to ruin your life/career/future prospects/etc.  Even if you get vindicated or absolved of doing anything bad, first thing people do after a job interview is Google your name, and if you show up being labeled any of those things they're not going to hire you.

Which establishment produces the most foolery: WalMart or McDonald's?
Hispanic? Yes, not the same as us down here though. Most of them were born and raised in the US. To me they are as American as any other Us citizen, they are nothing like us besides the broken Spanish and maybe the religion. In LatinAmetica Thieves get shot and killed when posible, some people aren't as nice and they get burned alive or beaten to death.
Society has taught us that the person screeching is always in the right. Case closed here folks

She's acting like a child throwing a tantrum hoping they'll get their way if they cause a big enough and people oblige them simply so they shut the fuck up.
She's definitely one of the scholars of all time.
Everyone standing around needs to be pointing and laughing.  We need to shame these psychopaths into thinking twice about this behavior.Unless its due to pharmaceuticals, then there is no hope of them changing
Repeatedly screams ‚Äúwhite piece of trash‚Äù, claims Walmart is racist. Not a lot of self awareness there.
The sad part is that there are legitimate issues to be confronted. I mean, civil rights are a good thing, right? Apartheid is bad, right? But somehow this is the lesson that was learned. SMH
Doing something I don‚Äôt like even if it‚Äôs my fault it has to be racist, facist, or literally Hitler.
&gt; If society ever breaks downthen that is bbq on the hoof right there.
The mainstream views on reddit are generally progressive liberal university campus level views. They‚Äôre stupid. Uninformed. Half-baked and lacking real world experience. In short, it‚Äôs ‚Äúenlightened stoner‚Äù opinions. I treat the general discourse and ‚Äúhivemind‚Äù mentality on this social media platform the same as I see Twitter, Facebook and even Instagram.
Belugas are white lol. They are also spectacular creature who I've seen many times in the wild. Take it back!
It sounds like a good idea but I would never be in favor of just rounding up people off the street to put them in institutions indefinitely.
Micheal myers??
&gt;Then Geraldo Rivera made his name w/ an undercover/hidden camera expose on the conditions in sanitariums.Just fyi a "sanitarium" is not the same thing as an "insane asylum" or what we would call a psychiatric hospital today. A sanitarium is not for people with mental health issues rather a place where people with tuberculosis would go to hopefully heal and recover from TB. The "sani" in sanitarium is the same root as in the word "sanitize."
It was genuinely educational though. I took DARE and stopped at weed and shrooms. Didn't want to end up a cokehead or meth addict. I think it was effective.

He turned into Tom Cruise.
I feel for the officer. Thats a mental picture he has to go home with everyday. A big sloppy ass mess of loud grossness. Poor guy.
The first part of this video shows her intentionally trashing displays and smacking the cop in the face.  She went from getting kicked out for shoplifting to multiple charges including assaulting a cop and resisting with violence.
I've listened to way more WW than I'd like to admit to... I have a friend who got a headbutt from him lol

And it's always the same "3 words" chanting, it's like they all study from the same playbook.
Or maybe she‚Äôs recently been to a trampoline park.
Ouch
She said her parents aren‚Äôt at home
Most certainly a scholar of some sort
O'Connor v. Donaldson was a mistake.
I listened to her argument, I weighed the facts, and I am deliberating on the idea that... perhaps... Walmart is racist?I mean, she makes a very consistent argument.
WALMART IS RACISS!!!
Hero in chase sequences
She built like a jello salad.
We should definitely try again. Instead of throwing 10s of billions at homelessness/drug problems, we can institutionalize these people and start cleaning up the streets. The return on investment will be huge. The funding diverted from the failed drug/homelessness policies can go into institutions to get their standard of care up. Win/win across the board. We are not a serious or functioning country at this point, though, and I fear a lot of these failures are planned, so I doubt much will be done in the long run.
The video video cuts out before the end. Eventually, the president of Walmart (Mr. Mart) comes out and profusely apologizes for his company's racist policy of charging money for goods and services. He immediately fired the security officer and handed her a bag of money. Everyone clapped.Also Jimmy Buffet is just vibin.
Yeah, sadly shutting them down was the correct thing to do. We really, really need some kind of replacement though. We're putting actual schizos out on the street because we can't do anything else with them. I've watched family members go through the cycle. There's no end to it until they either die or commit a crime heinous enough to lock them up forever.
Even if I was the type of person who'd shoplift, I'd be too embarrassed to ever act like this if they caught me.
"Walmart is RAY-siss!!"...took me a few to figure out what she was shrieking.
He knew how much a ride in an ambulance costs ü§£
She gonna suffocate herself‚Ä¶
This is a perfect living embodiment of exactly what the ‚Äúracial justice‚Äù and ‚Äúcriminal justice reform‚Äù movement turned out to really be: I should be allowed to steal and commit crime and if you don‚Äôt let me you‚Äôre racist.It‚Äôs perfectly captured in this video. The entitlement on display here captures what we‚Äôre seeing around the country perfectly.
I think it‚Äôs a certain type of behavior from low IQ individuals.If you watch a lot of the fight videos, you‚Äôll see certain people just regress into this primal mental state where they just keep repeating the same exact vocalization over and over.
This is exactly why the ‚Äúracist‚Äù thing is so goddamn played out. It‚Äôs just become a default line for ‚Äúi‚Äôm wrong but I need to still be the victim‚Äù.
Behavior like this is society breaking down
Delete lines 2-4 and you got a banger
Funny, but no. Though, we do seem to generally love Walmart.
I'm not saying Walmart is *not* racist, I'm just saying she is probably not the most credible source for that claim.
Built by American taxpayers. Gotta love govt cheese.
AW YOU JUST GONNA KEEP ON SHOPPING? MAYBE COMPARE SOME PRICES? DON'T HEAR A THING HUH

Those wards were pretty barbaric and dehumanizing. There may have been a few good ones but it seems that the bulk of them were horrific. They shouldn‚Äôt have continued the way they were, and any solutions that would be offered would be shot down for one reason or another, or under funded like before, or just not viable. As for this person in the video‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm not sure mental health is her issue. A lack of ability to live within society because she‚Äôs an entitled adult brat who doesn‚Äôt think the rules apply to her seems more like her issue (my armchair diagnosis based entirely off this short clip of her life). A mental ward, good or bad, would do nothing for her. She needs to be made to hike 40 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail, on her own. That‚Äôs what she needs.
Walmart.Save Money. Live Better.
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest came out in 1975 didn't help things either.
This woman is proof yoga pants cannot make everyone sexy.
Didn't know bean bag chairs could talk
Yup, I think that's the saddest part of the whole video. So many cameras recording.
i wish i could hi-five you but i'm zonked in the corner, trying to figure out why these pants won't go on like a shirt.
That‚Äôs so long ago though. Reagan caught John DeLorean for Thatcher, and now that the CIA is involved in drug trafficking‚Ä¶  the administrations since then want you to forget about what you learned in DARE. They need more money for mansions, so, please‚Ä¶ buy their meth and opioids. They thank you.
Literally zoomed by a loo
Sad but with these laws now a days they'll probably just tag and release her.
That view @12 is burned into my mind forever.  Also it's no surprise that this thing is using the race card.  That is what they're conditioned to do.
The hospital / morgue
Probably just a baby though.
At least she can breathe
It started under Kennedy b/c he hated what his father did to his sister. Then Geraldo Rivera made his name w/ an undercover/hidden camera expose on the conditions in sanitariums.Public outcry and the Democrats that held the House and Senate pushed it over the edge.  Reagan was just the President at the time, the ball was already rolling pretty hard.
She has the FFD card. Five Finger Discount card
Lizzo really fell off.
Yep, and possibly impregnating her, by a different baby daddy, adding another mouth the American taxpayer has to subsidize. Meanwhile we have thousands of illegal immigrants coming from Africa via southern border because Americans are so racist
Look at her size, she probably shoplifted a couple of times a day
When ur redlining that one last brain cell

That‚Äôs cool but why is she so gelatinous? How does her fat keep moving when she‚Äôs stationary? Is it inertia or is she defying physics?
Did she try swiping it?
Try that in South America?  Everyone in that crowd is Hispanic.  I thought this was South America at first.

Really? Theres been several of these videos of certain people screaming about racism thinking they can take what they want.
She thinks yelling "Walmart is racist" is her "get out of jail" free card? "Racist" has lost all meaning for like the past 10 years already, just like how "nazi, fascist, sexist, racist, phobe this and phobe that" have also lost their meaning because they have been thrown around by morons on the internet without even understanding what they mean."Everyone I don't like is literal Hitler" became the downfall of this generation, smh.
Doesn't the word racist have a T at the end? Oh, I see it now.
Denied
She may or may not have been institutionalized at one point, but they are probably so her fatass doesn't slip because she knows she can't get back up. She wasn't even resisting arrest, she was trying to help the officer get herself up, but neither could. (this part is clearly a joke)
Yeah, to hell
so where could i find the original madlads

I am a survivor of armed assault and battery.  My loved one and I survived because we exercised our constitutional rights.  Some Redditors criticized me for defending myself and my loved ones because GUns aRe bAd.  There are actually people on Reddit who support people like her.

Yup the Australian work safe ad‚Äôs are next level horrific. Really, the majority of the Australian PSA ad‚Äôs are horrific. The old ones particularly.
I guess they are expecting a loud explosion with a shock wave and with a probability of some object falling on them just like normal people. Suicide bombing is something you can only do once so nobody is a pro at it.
Yeah. You see, the human suicide bombers go in and blow shit up, but that costs money. So they send in the terrorist ducks afterwards to settle the bill.

Could you show me the source? I haven't heard of it
oh, i just meant that i saw a twitter thread of people mentioning or even posting clips of these kind of commercials that they remember seeing when they were younger. i didn‚Äôt mean it to be offensive if it was, sorry.
Lol?
note to self: do not enter kitchen
i saw this and a lot of other similar clips on twitter lol
TIL ear drum can be artificially created. Feel sorry for her.
Success we blew up a guard shack!  üß®
Anyone remember the drunk driving video where the person got their skull busted open and the video showed it? They showed us that in driving school.
I knew it would be this one!  PSAs outside of the US are frightening and amazingly done
at first it looked like the child was going to ride on the snake. looked kinda fun. Do they make muzzles for pythons?
Uhhh, 2 casulties?
‚ÄúOUT OF THE KITCHEN‚Äù is a phrase my dog knows well üòÇ
well now I‚Äôm terrified of my dog being in the kitchen now :/
this is one commercial I never did fully get out of my head, I constantly had this playing in my head when I was still grinding out in kitchens. I guess you could say the message was quite effective, though I still did cut and burn the fuck out of myself though, but thats pretty standard in kitchen life.
Oh yes. This one and the one with the girl falling off the ladder into the glass case shattering it and then standing up all bloody with glass sticking out of her. There were more gory ones too, but I don't remember them. Had to watch these every year since grade 7 or 8. Canada don't fuck around with workplace injuries I guess.
Nah, someone else's baby isn't their responsibility.
What the fuck Canada? Are you guys ok up there?![gif](giphy|xT9IgCiGBJ9SD1BUWc)
Just did The Google, I think you're right....
Don't you mean, "allah?"

Never sat through signal 80, red asphalt etc.  in drivers ed, did you?
German industrial safety films are the best. Pretty sure they weren't intended as such but they were really slasher film shorts. I wanted my company to get them but my boss knew what a rascal I am and had HR check them out before putting in an order.
Don't believe every news you see. UAV attacks are generally carried out supported by intelligence. And they are not civilians, but senior militants of SDF terrorists.
OH MY GOD! That actually was horrifying!
Wow i havent seen this scene on the bear
The turkish state is drone striking people every week in syria tho
YPG was and still is helped by the us tho, previous commenter is referring to them
I wonder if he actually meant to explode right there. He was ovbiously shouldering and firing a rifle as he advanced. Police shot and killed his accomplice. Maybe the cops also shot at him but hit his bomb vest causing it to explode.
*DidAnd to answer your question, no.
is that a citroen c3?
Thanks !
I remember these on TV....I was high as fuck and there was this one where the guy fell off a ladder into glass....I was tripped right out
No one that mattered?
Again, someone who is 2000 km away from Turkey and the Kurdish geography is selling us "correct information" about our country. Come to the east of Turkey and see if what you say is real or not? Cope.
Well shit. I just did that and now I‚Äôm bleeding from my anus.
Fucking hell that scream was the most horrific I‚Äôve ever heard that was horrible.

Damn, what's with this week same in France a lady with an AK shot down 2 civilians at Marseille
Ah yes traumatise the children bet it worked tho
I only hesitated at the "No casualties". Your description has two dead. I assumed you meant no one dead except those who tried to kill others.
Jeezus.
I got showed this exact video in my 7th grade Culinary class, and that's how I got introduced to gore.
You should go find Australia's old worksafe ads. This exact scenario was one of them, but there were others, and they all traumatised a generation
I feel good how we aren't even counting the terrorists as casualties
can you give a spesific example about ‚Äúpassive and subtle genocide of Kurds‚Äù?
I LOVE how the title doesn't even count the disgusting terrorists as casualties.
Congratulations terrorist, with your ultimate sacrifice we got the gate scratched.Terrorists: 1Gates: 0
First: It's not a terrorist attack. It's not aimed towards civilians.Second: The turkish government is actively invading Kurdistan to this day, who are figthing for freedom. The turkish military does a lot worse to kurd civilians than you have seen now done to a military post guard.
Nice username
Is that Dani Kind?
The ones attacked most prolly say this. But necesarraly the attakcer.
No casualties.  Except them.
HELICOPTER HELICOPTER
No casualties? Are you sure about that?
I actually heard the Final Fantasy 7 fight music in my head, but I can now hear the Oblivion fight music as well now that you've posted it. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HV3oyxr0Eg&amp;ab\_channel=JoshB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HV3oyxr0Eg&amp;ab_channel=JoshB)
The original commenter said:&gt;When it‚Äôs only the bad guys, it doesn‚Äôt count. Nothing of value was lost.It's pretty apparent that they were joking, and so was I.
Wait, do they also have terrorists ducks???
fucking feeders man
Why do they always have to risk the lives of innocent civilians‚Ä¶
3 People dead, 2 Terroriests and 24 yo Veterinarian which the terrorists killed to obtain his car.
The terrorists also killed a 24 year old male veterinarian and stole his car.
do you know how vulnerable the people they gaslight into doing this are.theres some fantastic research into who they pick and how they indoctrinate them into doing it. they interviewed survivors of suicide bombs which didnt detonate or couldn't do it.ill try and find it, its just another layer of sad horror in top what is already a sad horror
No. It‚Äôs about English. A casualty is an injury or death caused by an event.
Would have awarded this. üèÖ
Casualties means killed or injuredFatalities means killedNeither are based on "sides"
Absolutely!Accidentally in purpose of course
It's more about the term "casualty" and how it refers to something lost with each side in a war having their own casualties. I don't think these gents are considered casualties from the perspective of Turkish people.
Don't you worry about that my friend. : )My manager who is 65 and a is a native speaker of English still writes *your for you're* and *strickly for strictly* : )Thank you for the video.
Generalisation is wrong. Not all the Kurds, please. There are millions of Kurdish originated citizens in Turkey hates this and wants this to stop. Police officers protecting the building could have been Kurdish originated, maybe they are, i don't know. There are many Kurdish originated Police officers and Army officers in Turkey. PKK and its offspring YPG is the terrorist, and they don't represent the whole race.
This actually happened to my friend. She was carrying a pot of boiling noodles to the sink and tripped over her dog. She had 2nd and 3rd degree burns on her arms, neck and face.  Had to have skin grafts. AND... they didn't know this for a week, but some of the boiling water had entered her ear, boiling away her ear drum, making her deaf in that ear. Surgeons had to create a new ear drum for her.
What about the ministry of exterior?
better English than some Americans. it‚Äôs ok
Reminds me of the movie Four Lions.
Looks like he managed to attack only the exterior of the interior ministry
No casualties? I‚Äôm 99% sure that person did not survive the blast. They are probably very very dead.  Then you say the 2nd person was killed by police.  This would seem like they died. I‚Äôm not a scientist though so‚Ä¶
Ha! Got'em.. not.
Casualties means killed or injured. It's just an error in translation.
Waste of life.
Well that was pointless
Allah hated that one guard shack
He had a hard on for gates.
They are fucking stupid.
if you see a mother fucking screaming allah quackbar. get the fuck out.
... Am I the only one who noticed the gate arm relent after the explosion?
Terrorism is terrible, but maybe if Turkey stopped the  passive and subtle genocide of Kurds shit like this wouldn't happen
the hole in the ground that holds whatever is left of his corpse would make a great toilet

Thank god for stupidity.
How is that odd?
Aah that's right üëå
A casualty is usually defined by the ones you want to live and defend. An enemy dying is usually classed as a success, casualty by definition is a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù
How can you say someone blew himself up and there was no casualties?
He's fine, Jim
[health bar doubles after first blast]
Yea sad that happened. But they killed him in another city way before this incident.
You were writing like they were exclusively injuries.  Or I wouldn't still be trying to explain this to you.  Can you read the things you wrote.  Yes, those things.  Jesus dude. You are not playing dumb you have gone pro.  Good luck with that.
From the comments, it seems like pkk took responsibilty. So its about establishing kurdistan by terrorism
That is exactly what I've said this entire time. Low reading comprehension?
Looks like Marjorie Taylor Greene
A person killed or injured.  That is the definition.  Do You have a dictionary?
Your post says a veterinarian was ‚Äúdeceased‚Äù by the assailants. That‚Äôs the first death right there.
Illiteracy is widespread, and English must not be your language?  Have someone explain it to you slowly.
Which is funny because ISIS is an extreme offshoot of the Taliban who the US also funded in an attempt to push the soviets out of Afghanistan.
Yeah, he seems to have a rifle.
Any background on this? Is it known who the attackers are? Part of a group? Motives?
Most terrorists says one seconds before detonation so I doubt that also isn‚Äôt pkk goals is just to get independence from Turkey, and they have no religious  reasons or goals
Qq1
Do you have a dictionary?Casualties is not Fatalities. Casualties includes injuries. Today you learned?
They died of natural causes (deeply rooted in their minds)
Low reading comprehension or genuinely ignorant?
No one died but two people on diet
Half of my wardrobe is casual tees!Peace
I wish all suicide bombers were so inept or unlucky that their attacks would cause 0 casualties other than themselves.
Casualties are people that don't want to die, these are what you call martyrs.
No, casualties is specifically used for injured or killed individuals. Victim is more of a general term. You can be victim to a money scam, but not a casualty to a money scam.
No idea. Like I said, possibly brain shrinkage due to malnutrition.
I get that. Words have meanings though.
"Allah hu Akbar"
No casualties... impressive skill blow yourself up and also to be killed by the police without dying.
Yeah I'm glad that nothing of significance happened what exactly does killing the security do? Now the Turkish government is in full awareness of what is going on and will look to take people down.
That is not what casualties means.
i dont think he got all of his virgins for that mission he failed.
Has Sultan Erdogan already used this and imprisoned more of his opponents?
I dont see something blows itself up in order to kill people as animals or humans. So i dont see any worthy casualties here.
How do you blow your self up and not be a casualty?
Sorry my english is not the best. Didnt catch the error there. Ill try to be better next time.
Sorry for the late reply.I neither didnt see or hear any human or animal being hurt. So my bad if i dont see the ‚Äúcasualties‚Äù here.
Liar.
Thanks for the info. Now it makes sense.
PKK claimed responsibility. Man, malnutrition must be getting to their brains. I guess the picture of them skin and bones is a common sight in the organization.Sunday, early hours, most of the officers are at home, no person of importance to be killed, still manage to get murked by literally two petty police guards.
Sounds like it was regular terrifying.
Those are actually 2 girls
We should probably just leave the definition of a person at "human" because once you declare one group of the mentally fucked to no longer be considered "people" it opens the gate for further kinds of dehumanization and discrimination. Yes, they were horrible people, terribly misguided and likely deranged. But still people nonetheless. They had families and friends and functioning human bodies. Brains, maybe not so much, but still. It's a sad story with an honestly decent outcome as nobody other than them was hurt, but we can't just say they weren't "people," because they lived full lives up to this point, and everything in those lives led up to this. They were people, just really fucked up people.
[Fight music](https://youtu.be/ODgzOZZVJQg?feature=shared) started playing
And the vet. But apparently vets don't count either. Or the police that were injured.
Can't be a casualty if you're the attacker, kinda how games track kills separate from deaths. To continue the analogy, these guys have a 0/2 k/d in this attack.
Where is Saddam Hussein when you need him amirite?
Pkk isnt kurds. Its a terrorist organisation that attacks and kills both turks and kurds mostly in south east of turkey
Who is responsible for the attack?
The things people do for a fairytale.
*Wait.. do we still get virgins if we don't kill anybody at this this is ends up being just suicide?*Of course my dude: virgin city next!
No one died, two worthless pests are gone that‚Äôs all
No casualties.....that matters
‚ÄúCasualties‚Äù means injuries. Two police officers were injured in the attack. There were casualties.
Casualties includes everyone and it also includes injuries. There were at least 5 casualties. 1 - veterinarian deceased  2 - terrorists deceased  2 - police officers injuredYes, after reading more there were 3 fatalities, plus 2 injuries equaling to 5 casualties.
So one blew himself up and the other got blasted by police , but no casualties? Wtf lol
Gunfire
There were no casualties in the featured assault in the video.You do not count the deaths of criminals, or enemy combatants, as casualties.However, There was one casualty in their first crime, to steal the vehicle used in this assault.
‚ÄúDouble decease‚Äù‚ÄúTriple decease!‚ÄùRampage
This isn't about English, it's about morality.
Kurds ?? Any information
Same. But we went out of season and everything was closed. Pretty boring week spent by the hotel pool.
Is that victims?
Nope
Cuplrits who go in to blow themselves up are not casualties. Casualties are those who get caught up in incidents like this.
Kurds. The people the U.S. helped some years ago fight ISIS are now the terrorists.
But do they count as people when they willingly blow themselves up to possibly kill others?
This was such a great plan. Lots of time and prep went into this. I'm assuming this was the conversation.Bomb guy- "ok, ill go in first. I'm gonna run up to the little guard shack and detonate my vest immediately. This will give you a concussion and make it easier for the police to kill you." Other guy- "Hell yeah, that plan sounds dope AF."
You sure? What about that one guy who exploded?
No body was hurt except 2 people died(terrorists)
Lol. Not sure that's how English works.
Well.. Do their lives matter?
When it‚Äôs only the bad guys it doesn‚Äôt count. Nothing of value was lost.
Papers, Please
Dudes pushing rope out there
This must have been traumatizing for everyone involved, except the store workers and customers.
I've been deceased.
No casualties eventho two died? Wut
Wait cus maths‚Ä¶so two terrorist one shot one went pop and also the veterinarian who‚Äôs car they stole? But no one died
No one died but 2 people died.
Probably was, but that's the kind of thing that can fall through the cracks....
3 died I think but no casualties apparently
Yes, again. Nobody was hurt. Nothing to see here.
Red health bar
2 dead, no casualties....I guess their death wasn't casual enough.
‚Äú Don‚Äôt worry, nobody died! Except for two guys. They did die.‚Äù
That‚Äôs a lot of firepower for an S-vest.
Lol. After I reviewed it looks like he is firing a weapon as he is running to the gate.
He was speaking in tongues
All good news except for the guy cleaning the road
"No casualties" then deceasing the vet to steal the car
How do the pedestrians know to start running away?  I wonder if the bomber was yelling something.
Welp..mission NOT accomplished.
I believe there are two casualties.
Reminds me of Cory and Trevor trying to rob the laundromat on trailer park boys and everyone just ignores them and continues to do their laundry.
How?
This title is deceasing me.
Why attack ministry of interior. What they did wrong???
He's fine
Here is another comment by another person to the same point, dumbass.They destroyed themselves by performing surgery on themselves? What an idiot argument. Dumbass. https://reddit.com/r/oddlyterrifying/s/sGkZEGBTwX
When you hire a contractor and build your dream house, do you get the construction materials and do it yourself? Dumbass.Ok, let me explain to you: She hired a surgeon to perform this on her, hence causing the effect on herself. The surgeon didn't force this on her.
The Incredibly Deadly Viper from A Series of Unfortunate Events be like
Oh yeah? She performed surgery on her own face? That must have taken serious skill. Dumbass.
