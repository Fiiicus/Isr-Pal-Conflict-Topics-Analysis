True but there was video of him on it right before it happened?
prefer this one  https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sz9r0kZPGZY
In a few places he might have gotten shot
Yeah, I just looked, and I guess since that was 20 years ago, not that many reporters had phone cameras in their hands at all times, so it only got recorded on still cameras.
Lmfao she just said no and walked out
Eh, you don't need a gun if you have someone beaten down mentally. That's how abusive husbands (and wives) stay married so long. If we have people out here getting others to do full on murder, I don't think it'd be all that hard to talk your wife into getting surgery. Hell, lots of them are having surgery because someone else has shamed them into it already.
I've seen that he loved cats like tigers and things and that's what she was going for.... I don't recall reading that he made her do it,  but I wouldn't be surprised if it was his idea.

Aw, buddy. This could be out of an episode of Atlanta lol

What possible reason is there to put a gun inside a bag?
You could have told me this was a scene from a Kevin Hart movie and I would have believed it.
I remember her doing this for her husband who promptly dumped her.
&gt; apparently it was her ex husband who made her undergo plastic surgeryDid he point a gun at her and another one on the doctor while doing so?
She was actually quite pretty before this.
She did it to herself. Her husband did not perform surgery on her.
Yeah, these are the causes of socialite disease, whatever TF that is.
summer in atlanta is like a mix of GTA and reno 911 at times
He doesn't have a day job
I mean, he *did* snatch her phone, so she kinda was...
Lmao I forgot about that. Just went to look cant find video of the boom. Just still shots 🤣
She looks like those face stretchers in Star Trek Insurrection
💀
I can find no evidence of that. I hope it’s not true. She did continue to have surgery even after they separated.
A bite from that snake would be nasty on a baby. They need to get him away from it.
Michael Myers finally found the love of his life
apparently it was her ex husband who made her undergo plastic surgery (quick wikipedia search, could be wrong), either way super sad to see someone destroy themselves like this

So the "gun in a bag" is so it won't count as armed robbery?
Hey Sarah Connor!

You are mistaken OP, she has explicitly said multiple times that shes never had cosmetic surgery 🙃🙃🫠🤪

[The wild wild Wildenteins](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-daily/id1200361736?i=1000628143606)The NY Times podcast The Daily just did a segment on the potential downfall of the Wildenstein family art empire.  Truly wild stuff revealed about the art world, generational entitlement, misogyny, tax dodges and divorce.  If you give a listen you’ll come to understand why the women in this family might feel the need to self mutilate.  Eat the rich.

Hot damn. Are they shooting a horror flick and one of the actors walked off in makeup?

At least when he gets caught, he has somewhat of a feasible defense in claiming he was only joking around.

These dudes with their purses look so silly.  Usually they have sweatpants so it makes a bit more sense, but this man has pockets for christsake.
i've actually been a part of something like this before. was eating at a restaurant and some dude comes in, goes to the register and started yelling that this is a robbery and to give him all the cash. the people working there pretended to be hard of hearing and kept saying "WHAT? Oh what? Robbery? Okay take a seat we're really busy right now"had to stop myself from laughing at how poor that guy looked. going into a packed restaurant demanding money, essentially being ignored and walking away in shame.
Odds are he won't see his next birthday!
Dude looks like he’s 4’6”. Ain’t nobody talking his tiny ass serious.

This just shows how stupid these people actually are. Pretty well known that stolen Apple products don't make it far.

So we’re shaming working parents with no other option? What’s sad is that both parents have to work these days to make ends meet. My wife and I have a 1.5 yo kid. We work in healthcare, leave for work at 7am and get home at 7pm. Enlighten me- what am I supposed to do besides day care for my child? Not to mention the benefits of a structured day and the socialization with other kids. As an FYI, I do not have the privilege of having a family member watch my child all day (both my parents are still working into their 70s and live in a different state).Edit: I’m being downvoted? You people suck.
No, he is responsible for having it near children. I never even said anything about fentanyl specifically. Why would the drug dealer be blameless for the death of this child? He left these drugs within these children's reach. Ya'll are something else if you say otherwise.
But how's the dog?
Excuse me did you just try to hold the drug dealer accountable for being responsible about fentanyl?
Weird take lol are people supposed to take their kids to work?
And if any dies from an OD from the shit she was dealing are we gonna hold her responsible?   They often say that elsewhere, until a local cop gets busted with enough fenty to kill everyone in 6 counties.

Hey bro, accepting ones own responsibility is a lot of people's problems. Nobody wakes up and decides to become an addict. It's a process with many factors involved.  But your argument of those who are making the drugs deserve a pass doesn't hold water.
So what are you in for?I stole some bricks.

They don’t care about the cops, the cops will protect each other 😂
Shopping mall near me has an apple store. Sure, that area around the mall is nice, but right outside of that is ghetto. It's like a small bubble within the ghetto honestly. So, yea, maybe not their direct hood, but it's within their reach (until they pack up and leave).

Speaking from experience..... if you are trying to double your product, you can use baby laxatives, caffeine,  lidocaine, aspirin, etc. They are using fentanyl because it amplifies the desired result.  The dope that had fentanyl vs. aspirin is drastically different.  The demand is obvious.
I don't own any Apple products; is this a normal feature? Like for example if your phone gets stolen you can remotely brick it? And is it permanent?
Fkin stupid assholes…
Holy shit.
The numbers don't seem to add up.He was first sentenced in 1979 and got parole in 2015 at 57. So he spent 37 years in prison (1 year from parole granted to release). Where do the 44 years come from? Is that including the time from 2016 to now?
Cop got busted last week with 104 pound of fenty, San Jose cop union boss was ordering shit from her desk at work, directly from China and Hong Kong.      Cops are def part of the problem but in this case just dupes and mules.
People are is using Frntanyl to cut other drugs with, increasing the volume and therefore the weight of what they’re selling. It’s not a transparent demand.
There is a very good chance a dealer up the line somewhere is a cop. We have seen that cops are yuge dealers (both dealing and smuggling) of fentanyl.     Let's let the cops bust everyone up the food chain until they find the cops.
That’s funny, when I was a toddler and my dad told me he was an engineer and I also thought he drove trains.

It's more about the friends they made that night.  Friends who will probably steal from you when they visit.
Lmao I love how they can’t even comprehend how it’s possible at all.
I feel like this is the CIA/south America problem of cocaine all over again. I wouldn't put it past certain people in power to flood our streets with this shit to strengthen the war on drugs. I would also bet that the drugs that are laced were originally in an evidence then cut and thrown back out on the streets.
how could we get the police to start to go after property crime? Maybe we need a whole new force to hold criminals accountable since police are too busy?
Only dumbass idiots don’t know that Apple could brick these iPhones and iPads immediately.

I'm no aviation expert, but....
She forgot that it wasn't election season
Idiots.
Damn. What must other countries think when they see this?
They should track these people down. Clearly, they are braven enough to post their crime on social media. And before anyone says, “who cares, they are stealing from a multi billion corporation”. Right, agreed. I don’t care about Apples losses, I care about this type of behavior needing to be put to an end and receiving consequences.
Great job on the sobriety.  My mother and father were both addicted. I was one of those children you spoke of. It really is no life to live. I love your positive message.  God bless bro and keep it going.
Why are these dorks recording and posting these videos? So dumb.
When i was in my heroin addiction, none of my dealers ever used, they just smoked weed. But they will sell to you come hell or high water to make that money.I'm not proud of it but one time I had to go into my dealers house, he was cutting up heroin on the counter WITH his kids. His young daughter was probably 12 and she was cutting and weighing up my bag. I was in the height of my addiction and withdrawing so all I could think of was how to feel better. But it was a fucked up situation. Those kids are already fucked from the start.To put a little happy vibes in this comment, I'm 4 years sober, have my dream job, and have my family back in my life. Life couldn't be better.

Honestly get fucked.
Lol, they probably think they drive trains...
Maybe 30 years ago, there was a code with dealers but that ain't the case any more my friend
i really hate how reddit is destroying the ability to send links
I wish they exploded after getting bricked
think of the children!!!!!!  honestly, that's so freaking awesome
Maybe just start by not keeping it around children. There is responsibility that is with the drug dealer. Then the dude fled like a real POS. Dealers aren’t always users. Big pharma helped fuel all of this so China is definitely not the only one at fault.
Companies have been able to blacklist phones for almost 20 years now. I used to get people trying to activate sullen phones all the time.
This crap is literally everywhere.  I know the big news line is "stop China from manufacturing it". But in reality we have to help those who are going to addiction at numbers that have never seen before.  China wouldn't make it if there wasn't demand for it.... just saying
Lol what the fuck did they think was gonna happen
Haha. What losers. Risked felony charges for a police tracking device. Hope. They end up in prison.
We breaking into the liquor store because we out here starving, we gotta eat!

That's a damn beautiful cut.  I rate it 8.78/10
Curious, why do you think it is ?
So they got nothing and the stores move away from the area soon after lmao
Damn I need that chuckle first thing in the morning. If you're stupid enough to steal phones from a store, you're stupid enough to not know Apple will brick them.
Why would they think that they would have working Apple products. These are display items. They have all the numbers and can remotely brick them. Dumbasses.![gif](giphy|12msOFU8oL1eww)

How do you think the justice system works? Do you think people are arrested and then sent directly to prison. After getting arrested for less severe crime, people are released on bond until their trial, and get a warrant on them if they don't show up on their trial date. If convicted in trial, they are sent to prison.

The parts in those iPads and iPhones would never work in any phone ever again. Apple doesn't let you switch parts between phones and install your own parts, let alone parts from a bricked phone. They were worthless the minute they were stolen lol
PA only allows liquor sales from state run stores. At least it was that way in Philly.

It's sad that all of these are wasted now, like I don't give a fuck about Apple's profit margins, but these materials being wasted is a damn shame. 😔
As shitty as it is. To them it's a way to protect their customers. I don't use apple but I do give the kudos for their attempts at security. Like when they refused to give up access to the fbi and had a 3rd party come forward that cracked it. To date I've not heard one example of them bricking products "just because " that could change in the future but your only real recourse is to not use any technology...
I don't think you know what arrested entails. You can be "arrested" then leave free an hour later. Yes the cops seemingly did their jobs,  now how about the DA?...
Wait. . . . State run? Liquor stores? Wtf
Am I terrible for wanting these compilations to include a death counter?
They were all released immediately, some are seen in other videos later
Yea, but the cops did let them go, so they can do it again.  Or am I wrong?  Are they locked up and serving time?  Are they facing the consequences of their actions?
Right it’s like they forgot that a phone has to be turned on via a service provider in
Surprised they haven’t locked this one yet
On the mugshot she looks like what Hannibal Buress would have looked if he gained even more weight instead of losing it lmao.
If I buy something I don’t want the seller to have a built in way to take it away from me.
I’m not trying to be funny but imagine someone handcrafting that iPhone, which should be gifted to some young person as a reward or a nice upgrade to their old phone, only to have them thrown into the sewer or juice poured over it. The disrespect people have is outrageous in the US
What a waste of perfectly good electronics. Those chips and processors are difficult to manufacture and are valuable. Those idiots are genuinely worth less than the processors themselves

This is too funny. You gotta love stupid criminals. It sucks for Apple but these idiots do make for some entertaining content.
Damn I’m sure they were just really hungry!
Progress
They don’t steal those.
“This is crazy.” No. This is technology idiots.
Idiots.
FYI over 50 were arrested for this. The cops didnt just let them go.
Good! Fuck those little pricks. They shouldn’t be allowed to breathe our air if that’s the shit they do. Apple did the right thing. Just for that I’m gonna go BUY the new iPhone because I like a company that doesn’t cave to criminals
FYI over 50 were arrested for this. The cops didnt just let them go.

Why? Your phone only works bc they make it work. They update the software all the time. They built the hardware themselves. I wish they did more. I wish they would stop me before I make bad decisions!“***HEY mfer! Put the box of donuts back! You’ve been doing so good don’t go fucking it up now!***”“***HEY mfer!

If they could get those phones/Ipads to quiet, they have extra parts. Instead, they smashed them. Dopes.
You will be missed.
Or turn on LOCATION so they can all be arrested.
Strange knowing they could that to your phone though
What is my perfect crime? I start flash mob raid on the flagship Apple Store at midnight. Do I go for the iPhones? No, the mob is just a diversion. I go for the original Apple I hand-built by Woz and Jobs. It's priceless. As I'm smashing the display case, a woman catches me. She tells me to stop. It's her father's business. She's Fiona Apple. I say no. We make love all night. In the morning, the cops come and I escape in one of their uniforms. I tell her to meet me in Mexico, but I go to Canada. I don't trust her. Besides, I like the cold. Thirty years later, I get a postcard. I have a son and he's the chief of police. This is where the story gets interesting. I tell Fiona to meet me in Paris by the Trocadero. She's been waiting for me all these years. She's never taken another lover. I don't care. I don't show up. I go to Berlin. That's where I stashed the computer.
It’s a deterrent. “If I steal this thing it’s gonna blare an alarm so maybe I shouldn’t steal it.”

I bet Samsung could figure it out

I tried posting it to there and got a permaban
Who’s going to take, carry and bring home something that’s screaming an alarm
Imagine committing crime for no gain. I'm so happy this backfired.
What's the purpose of making the thieves aware of the alarm? Wouldn't it be more useful for them to keep quietly transmitting the location?
physics. that shit doesn't play
Link pleaaaase
This guy loots!
You could reduce your question to just the first three words and that would be sufficient. The answer to that is no, they probably aren’t doing much thinking at all. Ever. Lol.
the orange juice was a nice touch 🧃
Wow, that's kind of cool. I wonder how they did it so fast? Some engineer at Apple who made coded that is laughing his ass off right now!
Like the police give a flying F.  Have you forgot it’s 2023 and no one gets prosecuted for property crimes any longer
Awesome
Gotta love the turn about. Fuck these losers.
I don't think they can comprehend what Apple engineers even do...
What a bunch of fucken idiots.
Smh this is fucking pathetic

I wonder if they actually thought apple was going to act like surprised pikachu and count their losses…

🤣🤣🤣
She was arrested and crying on her mugshot saw it on Twitter
They shouldnt play alarms. Just share the location. 🤷🏼‍♂️
So many prints
at least if you're robbing an apple store. Nab the accessories  not the devices themselves. A lot easier to sell I bet + no lockout.
Did they think they could outsmarted Apple engineers?
Good for them bums.![gif](giphy|l378bu6ZYmzS6nBrW|downsized)

Apple should be ashamed of themselves, robbing poor people of their honest days work. Now they'll have to actually get a job...
The cameras on these devices should just livestream to the police when these alarms go off

I downvote you because you're leaving out a fuckton of information that heavily points to her culpability while you're focusing in one tiny aspect that matches a past miscarriage of justice. The deaths matched her shifts, after being changed a couple of times and even moving hospitals, they stsrted with her and ended whenever she left. She falsified the babies records and kept some files as souveniers, while also making a personal list of fatalities and near fatalities.There's no smoking gun, but virtually all evidence has excluded every other possibility except her as the culprit. The only reason the case has gone on for so long probably has to do with the hospitals being very picky about what they give to police. Anything that implicates them as negligent and liable for keeping a fucking serial killer around will get swept under the rug.
Hopefully oinky goes to jail and gets put with big Billy Bob

The disrespect. Full on made eye contact with the camera before even looking back at the dog
I think you mean the innocent pibble was harassed by an aggressive cat for trying to make a new friend and be a great nanny. You can tell you are about to be nannied when the pibble is unrestrained and notices you. A good way to avoid being nannied is move to a place without nanny dogs. Bigot. Also your comment was kinda racist, i know you didn't mention race but... like... it just *feels* racist, ya know?
If a man’s ass becomes more important than basic hydration under any circumstance then you’re probably just gay. It is what it is. Nothing to be ashamed of…just calling it like it is.

Boondocks did an episode on this lol
Lol all good, I feel old just knowing all that.. I forget how old even the cartoon is.. I used to have the first season on the first iPod video that ever came out.. I thought I was soooo cool to be playing standard definition boondocks cartoon on the go (this was 2005 before touch screen smart phones were even available)
Wow I forgot it was even a comic like that, I think they were in newspapers what feels like a thousand years ago.
I was locked up with someone who did time with him at Eddyville. He’s definitely out again as of a couple months ago. Dude is an absolute menace.
I would've hunted this man down
I'm pretty sure a 200 pound dog would still murder me and you
Dammm
I never knew the boondocks episode was based on an actual thing😅😂😂🤣🤣🤣
That cat might be Randy Orton
He was only fired after a fuss was made. They don't give a shit about public safety.
Wasn't cooperating. Bad idea.

I honestly thought this was a Chappelle sketch.
Exactly who is the "dumb bastard".
I almost said "I'd pay money to see that" but then remembered animal fighting is bad.
A majority of characters are actually loosely based on real people. Such as:The Booty Warrior - Fleece JohnsonGangstalicious - 50 Cent Stinkmeaner - Butler Benson DuBoisEd Wuncler - George W. BushGin Rummy - Donald RumsfieldSgt. Gutter - Soulja BoyThugnificent - LudacrisWinston Jerome - Tyler PerryKardashia Kardashian - Kim Kardashian Pretty Boy Flizzy - Chris Brown A Pimp Named Slickback - Katt Williams Flonominal - Bustah RhymesMacktastic - Snoop DogReverend Rollo Goodlove - Al Sharpton These are just a few examples but the cartoon was based on a comic strip that ran as a political cartoon or editorial comic in the monthly magazine, “The Source“, so it has been parodying real life since it’s start and that theme followed through into the cartoon version.
"Booty. A man's butt."
WELCOME TO THE REAL WORLD, JACKASS!
He was 17. All he knows is the concrete booty jungle
Most of the early episodes were parodies of real life events,
My dad used to scare me straight with the tales of Bloody Bones and Mr. Miacca. Fuck, they didn’t have nuttin’ on ol’ Fleece Johnson!
No, he ain’t gay, he just practices “a very different kind of homosexuality.”
I mean calling a frenchie a dog is like calling Steve Seagal a great actor lol those mfers can run over a blade of grass and end up on their face
It also doesn't help when the dog is just curious and the cat goes all murderhobo on him. Granted there were ample warning signs but I don't think that dog was smart enough to pick up on them.
Jelly or Syrup? 🤤😂
editing, not ending
Too much free time in prison. Should make inmates work more
"I like ya, and I want ya"
Yeah I wasn't laughing very much, destroyed my relationship aswell, avoid that if you can.
Tbf doesn't around very fun lol
For Reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3d200DatLtU
Fleece Johnson the gayest flaming homosexual man Kentucky.
In a perfect world this guy would be executed for the things he’s done in the name of sexual desire in prison. But in our world we interview him on TV like a celebrity. Bro deserves to have his eyes and tongue surgically removed, not to tell a story.
Or should I say,  Chris Handsome
“I’m Trunkrone, and I’m here to pounce your wife.”
Dogs are tough, but cats are duelists and they’re disrespectful.
Source? Someone just posted a source saying he’s back in prison after only days of being released
You’re doing time, and one day a tv crew shows up and lets you say whatever you want, you’d have fun with it too
From take down to attempted murder. Damn that escalated fast
Every time I see one of those brown grey tabby’s with white socks, they are total badass cats. I adopted one once and she ruled the whole street
he only got fired.  if the roles were reversed, the civilian would be put in jail.

He was fired, it's the best we can hope for unfortunately.
So he was 13 when he first got locked up? That’s insane!
That’s where the booty is
Honestly the cat and this edit is so badass 😂
dude just wanted to go back to jail
I THREW THE REST OF THE CAKE TOO
This gives me the slow mo walk away from explosion vibe.

"you really think someone would do that Arthur? Just make up lies and post it on the internet?"The answer you're looking for is attention btw. They want attention.
What's even crazier is that he's out of prison and currently married. To a woman

[What a terrible time to be reading about this man, who is now OUT of prison.](https://www.gayemagazine.com/post/fleece-booty-warrior-johnson-speaks-out-about-boondocks-1-year-after-being-released-from-prison)&gt; Fleece Johnson, infamously known as the 'Booty Warrior" due to reportedly raping and sexually assaulting over 157 people while in prison, was released last year and is now speaking out about his 44 years behind bars.&gt; Originally sentenced to 10 years for armed robbery on July 26, 1979 at Kentucky State Penitentiary, Johnson would later be sentenced to an additional 18 years in 1987 on charges of “Wanton Endangerment” and “1st Degree Assault.” Wanton endangerment is defined under Kentucky law as engaging in conduct that creates a substantial danger of serious physical injury or death to another person.&gt; In October 1990, he was charged with “Assault on a Corrections Officer” four times, which added an additional 20 years to his sentence. From 1981 to 2013, he was up for parole 13 times after serving a minimum of 20-50 percent of his sentence however they were denied due to his sexual crimes on inmates and officers while incarcerated.&gt; After 4 decades in prison at the age of 57, Johnson was granted parole on June 28, 2015, after receiving a 'low-risk' assessment rating. Reportedly, he was officially released in June 2016, but he was arrested a few days later for armed robbery and sent back to prison.
He probably likes dick.
Not even a sentence.Dude got sent there from a staffing agency to be a custodian.They didn't expect this, and won't be utilizing his services in the future.

Wow...... Loved booty so much he turned 10 years into 40.  Good lord that's conviction.  (Pun Intended, after the fact.)
&gt; He just gay and don’t want to admit it.He was straight up admitting and damn proud of it, lol. Which is fine, ofc, but I think he was also implying he was proud of raping for the booty.
Had no idea that boondocks episode was based on real life 🤣
[Yup, but he still misses "booty"](https://mediatakeout.com/inmate-fleece-bty-warrior-johnson-released-from-prison-married-to-a-woman-but-misses-man-bty/)

"Eyeee yave a pro-blem..."
Op in stupidity for sure. I saw one that tried to pick a fight with a speedy bus cause the cat "claimed"  the middle of the road and wouldn't budge - standing a bit with claws out. Every cat-dog "fights" I saw was serious only on cats' side but once I saw a "fight" serious on both sides and yeah cat disappeared in seconds when tried to mess up with the wrong boxer dog  :(

I'm not a part of your system, man!
Jason Bourne lookin cute af these days
I'm pretty sure he's serious. He later claimed that he was paid by the guards to rape problem inmates to punish them.NVM that was the booty bandithttps://web.archive.org/web/20230115194956/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-oct-19-mn-23825-story.html
Lol you’re full of shit and you most definitely wouldn’t fight a 200 lbs dog over a 100 lbs cat 200 lbs dog would be a literal behemoth of a dog a 100 lbs cat is really big as hell but not gigantic guarantee the dog would maul you quicker than cat fucks you up I can see it if you said a 100 or so pound dog vs the same size cat but you know your lying out the ass if you think that you’d protect yourself easier against a 200 lbs beast like a mastiff over a 100 lbs cat like a cheetah the dog would win that fight lol Coyotes regularly take house cats all the time and coyotes are straight scared of even medium sized dogs so no no you wouldn’t
These draconian jack-boot-wearing government thugs must be STOPPED. We cannot allow them to continue treating the citizenry like enemy fucking combatants. It's wholly unacceptable.
interesting fact: he claims he was used by the guards to rape trouble inmatesNVM that was the booty bandithttps://web.archive.org/web/20230115194956/https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1999-oct-19-mn-23825-story.html
He said he likes booty, not dicks
That's where I heard it! That was bothering me!
Cats don't give a fuck.If the dog didn't start none won't be none.
Eat. The. Floor.
I’m talking about them lying. Not rape. No way he would’ve grabbed an freeworld camera crew man’s ass. He was just trying to scare them.
Someone should put that fucking pig down.
I see now where Boondocks got their inspiration from...
Lockup Raw on MSNBC was my show back in the day! I used to come home fucked up from parties late at night and always watch this show lol. Fleece Johnson you booty fleecin stud
When he says man ass is more important than drinking water I started to suspect that
Reminded me a bit of that video where that cat fucks up a pit bull that was attacking a child!
Let's be real, but I can imagine that that cop might just be suspended for a while because thier cops
Lol, meanwhile I had no idea Boondocks ripped this dude off for the speech from the guy who raped Chris Hanson.
I've shattered my clavicle, its not as fun as it sounds, took six+ months and a titanium plate to fix, cant imagine what that would cost in the us. The most physical pain I've ever experienced. That cop is broken.
Ugh dude, county weekend lockup is the worst!
dude was on work release too
I taya wut
THIS! Cats are perfect ‘ fuck you up ‘ machines. Teeth, razor claws, night vision, agile AF, climb, jump, fast….no thank you. Just a regular cat scratch from a 100 lb cat is like Freddy Krueger went to town
idk where or when you were a CO, but you can look up stats on prison rape in the US throughout history and its not good lol. I think its prob a lot better now but shit seemed to be pretty fucking bad back in the day
It’s called recreation.
Now how are you gonna borrow a fry? It’s not like you can give it back
Hope he can read it better than he can speak it
Ah, yes, I see that you know your judo well, succulent chinese meal
I'd gladly fight a 200lb dog over a 100lb cat. Cats are scary!
They want you to feel sorry for them or think they are a badass or someone important in prison.  That and they’re career criminals who have learned to lie their whole life. Why stop in prison. They’re always trying to get something or playing an angle to their advantage.

Why lie like that though? It's so strange to me why people make up bullshit when they don't really stand to gain anything by spouting it....Is it a form of posturing borne out of self-protection, that just snowballs?

Enough of these cat fu videos and someone will create a whole martial art.
They don't have to kill you to rape you. Just knock you out or have a bunch of dudes hold you down. Or just hold a knife to your eye and say we'll take you or gouge your eyes out then your tune will change real quick
GOD DAM
That looks unnecessary that's straight up assault.
This is TV history. Most of you are prob too young to know about “tossing salad” from an HBO prison series. That guy was scarier than Booty Warrior. I’m sure it’s on YT
Reminds me of an old video where an inmate says he likes to have his ass eaten with peanut butter or jelly on it lol
Cats are terrifying especially when you are giving them a bath!  All 20 razor blades come out to play!
Just pirate it

Frenchies are so stupid. Those dogs suck and the cat was just letting it know
You could tell when he cracked up he's telling some bullshit. Then his lies got worse as time went on. Saying every single one agrees to be raped instead of the "hard way", and would have raped the camera crew back in the day lol
That video goes hard asf, love seeing it posted time to time.
So good
More slowed down animal fights! I love this lol
Yeah, dogs usually have a huge size advantage, but take that away and they won’t stand much chance.
First, discombobulate...
I thought he was a Chappelle show character.
Even better
Dude got out of prison did a interview was sayin he missed booty and was looking for someone to give him booty he dont care that he got a wife he just really misses male ass
Training the dog for bar fights. So far he’s got a long way to go.
Armed robbery then he kept gettin into trouble in jail nd went from a 10 year sentence to a 40 year bid he talks about it on some youtube channel

Hey, Chris Handsome...
“Oh Tooooom come out and *plaaaaaayyyyy*”
It’s extra funny that the cat looks so similar to mine.
I once saw a cat beat the living shit out of a corgi that was definitely trying to get into a fight. I also saw a cat fight a bear.I think you don't know how OP cats truly are.
Cat says time for a somersault dog. lol

Disgrace. This country is such a mess.

Ah shit, you know the homie Amit too?!
I’m starting to understand why he’s been locked up for so long. And thank God too that he has been.
One of the main reasons it's my only streaming that I pay for monthly. They have ALL the Adult Swim stuff and South Park sci gotta keep it in my life!

Also lots of people overestimate certain types of dogs. They are so inbred almost their entire body is fucked up. Like maybe his nails are fine but his knees, joints and face are definitely born injured and guaranteed to need medical treatment within 5 years at most. So all I'm saying its kind of fucked up that cat hurt a disabled person.

Ugh.
As far as I know they have all four seasons on HBO as well.
As a former 10 year Texas prison guard I’d bump that number up to 98%. When I watch these prison shows I laugh at the lies they’re telling the cameras and you know a lot of the people watching believe it.
Yeah, right. To scare kids. Uh huh.
Did anyone else start hearing the John Cena theme song while watching that?
Silly cats always win when facing a dog that juat wants to play amicably. When the dog is serious (which is rare), the cat is screwed. Stupid cats can't distinguish when a doggo just wants to have some positive fun.
Start paying lawsuits with the money raised by arresting and prosecuting misdemeanor offenders, and this will stop. If police want to buy thousands in better vehicles and weaponry to "fight crime," make sure that whenever something like this happens, it's taken out of their funding
“*Slap Ass*”
Someone did a recent interview with him and yup he's somehow married to a woman

I would fight to the death. I dont want to go to jail and i dont want my b00ty taken, i better be dead or unconcious or fully non compliant, to the grave.
That was badass!
Feels like this dude went on purpose…..
They have all been uploaded on youtube to watch for free by different users
He got fired but what does that help 🙁🙁🙁
This guy is a serial rapist and shouldn’t be allowed out of his cell.
"Im a worrier" Nah bro your gay
What a couple of absolutely worthless bags of shit. Acab
The producer, Dave, looked way too excited to go all DEEP COVER and discover the true essence of "booty"...
“I’m a warrior! Ahhhhh”
Did that cop ever get his badge revoked and sent to jail or something
Videos like this, real or not, keep me from doing something that can send me to prison.
I feel like he is trolling the tv producers hard…. He can barely keep a straight face you guys.
So you are saying there is a job opening at the prison? Someone told me I can sell my butt
Just watched this for the first time and it had me in tears. Totally normal video until he says “I add an ‘H’ to it”. Then he made me snort laugh
Some episodes of The boondocks are inspired by actual events. The psycho kid that Riley was hanging out with is another example.
TIL horny jail is an actual place apparently.
I feel like I would be perfectly happy just jacking off? I can’t imagine any amount of hornyness would make me turn to booty
 I really want to watch the boondocks but I have to sign up for hulu tv on top of their normal streaming service.
A lot of people underestimate cats when it comes to dogs. Cats are fast and quick to fuck something up
Another massive lawsuit the taxpayers will have to fund. What great government employees we have.
This my friends is a very dangerous individual.
I need the boondocks version for comparison
Snake, try to remember some of the basics of CQC.
Holy fuck, throw that cop in prison for attempted murder! Throw the guy on his head like that? Any civilian would be charged that way
😂😂
...... Sssoooooo.... The thing about the boondocks....https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XURRzofbMc0
got fucking beer all over my screen now, many thanks
When someone in prison named Fleece Johnson talks about the booty, you better listen.
I think he was released from prison somewhat recently. He was giving an interview about that scene and allegedly said he only said that shit to scare kids
Most of Boondocks is based on real events. Makes it that much better.
YOU CANT HAVE MY BOOOTY!!!
Very Freud reasoning: "Everybody wants [X]. Everybody's crazy for [X]" (is clearly personally obsessed with it)
“Shea taystes lyke cig-rayettes.”
Rape isn’t as widespread as people make it seem (anymore) …. But it’s still an issue. PREA has gone a long way but it also, in a way, muddies the waters in terms of the problem. Now, EVERYTHING is classified as rape. Even consensual relationships. In a way, it takes away from the victims of the actual violent, brutal act because they get mixed in with everyone else that’s gettin it on behind bars.
And married to a woman, yet still proclaims his love of booty
“I likes you. And I wants you. We can do this the easy way….or the hard way.”
That avi you got + this comment got me wonderin what you mean exactly
“You see, I didn’t come for no little boy. Don’t got no milk no cookies no nothing.Naw….I came for a man’s butt.”
He is out and has a bunch of interviews on YouTube. He has got some bat shit crazy stories. And not for nothing he talked about being liked up in adult prison at 14. He never has sex with a women before going in. Of course he loves man ass🤣
I actually thought the editing was pretty spot on. Although I generally want to regular speed and then the slow mo version :)
Anyone that has spent any time at all around inmates knows 90% of what they say is absolute gobbledygook. But 10% is booty.
I know damn well that producer gave up some booty
the ending is terrible?, meow!
Any chance you have the original without the terrible editing?
“🎶Been spendin most of his lifeAs a gangster chasin rats and mice.🎵
#nohomo
Bad ass cat.
I love how boondocks directly quotes from him
Every other prisoner: “oh, man, it ain’t like that. You been talkin to fleece, right? That dude a booty perv. You know he in for rape, right? He just gay and don’t want to admit it. Sad, really.”
This killed me
"I'm off to scratch my tummy with my massive member, elephant-style."

Wax ON, son.
That's why i'm a law abiding citizen.
Butt pirates love their booty.
Atleast it can be consensual now.
Booty Warrior
Aikidog rolled with it.
What’s crazy is he was only 2 days into his 3 month prison sentence.
It's all good if you say, "No homo!" before you dip it. 😂

I heard he’s been released.

I’ve seen more intelligible speech get the subtitle treatment.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE GROUND!!!!
He got out last month
The cat looks like it doesn't give a fuck walking away
This information is exactly what I’d expect to hear from a dude named “Fleece Johnson”…
See? Now I have to go have my ass cheeks sealed closed and sewn up.
My favorite was “smoking with cigarettes”.

[The Boondocks: Chris Hansen](https://youtu.be/3d200DatLtU?si=P9pHIWC7Qxyp9l_6)
I’m surprised at the number of people that don’t realize how much of the boondocks is based on real events
At first I was like, "what is this video doing here?". Then I was like, "Yup, this definitely belongs here".
"Heeeeyyy TOOOOMMM....come out to PLLAAYYeYA"
BAHAHAHA!! YESSS OMG I couldn't remember what it was about that guy...ut was THIS! LOLOL
No one can resist the booty
I had no idea the Chris Hanson scene from the Boondocks took such direct inspiration.
Just because *you* didn't find what I'm talking about there, doesn't mean one *teensy bit it dOeSn'T eXiSt*.WTF are you talking about I'm a narcissist because I and the OP and other comments have an issue with this chick getting public sympathy/support? I'm sorry that upsets, but goddamn the way you type is extremely far up your own ass. I never said I believe that if you don't think she's guilty it means you want to murder babies. I did say that your comparison is unfair because there's a difference between stabbing someone which leaves evidence, and medically killing babies that are already in critical condition which cannot possibly leave physical evidence - but there was evidence in the form of her motive. I'm sorry you can't grasp that you fucking dense asshat. I apologize, I thought this was a pleasant exchange/debate. Your most recent comment is so condescending and reeks of asshole that I won't be replying anymore other than to tell you to go fuck yourself. Push your glasses up your nose and blow it out your ass. Goddamn you're a prick.
It doesn’t matter one teensy bit if *you* think she 100% did it. Not everything is about you. It’s about what *they* think, but even more than that it’s about the principle of having a high standard of evidence before convicting a person. &gt; Your example is not a fair comparisonYeah, because it’s just made you realize what you’re saying is ridiculous. *I believe the evidence means she’s guilty, and anyone who disagrees with that wants to murder babies* is probably the most narcissistic train of thought I’ve ever unironically seen.To throw a dog a bone I did a deep dive into r/antinatalism and guess what I found? A bunch of people against **giving birth** who were all very much against killing babies - I know this because when one guy posted to complain about a campaign that raised $4mil baby’s medical operation, everyone else jumped on him because “this baby is alive already, this doesn’t count.” So narcissism + making stuff up? Not a great look…
Your example is not a fair comparison. While it is discomforting to nail it down to 'statistically likely', that's not the case with this chick. There are no stabbings, no blood, etc - because she purposely chose to kill where she had the opportunity. Babies that are already medically critical because she knew there would be zero evidence left behind. It's not statistically likely these babies were murdered it's 'Statistically virtually impossible' that they weren't. Her conviction is a unique case, but no one can possibly truly believe there is a reasonable doubt to her guilt. She was not solely convicted on the anomalies surrounding her, but because of motives found on her phone with the doctor she was in love with. That is evidence being left behind.Now as to your first point - go spend some time reading comments on subs such as antinatalism then come talk to me.
Didn't he say a plastic fan.  Is it a hand crank fan or an electronic fan
What’s funny is I almost didn’t include *Is it that you think these donators want babies to be murdered* because I didn’t think anyone had that thick a skull. Sure taught me a lesson. Why on earth would people want babies murdered? Nowhere on the planet is indiscriminate baby murder a thing people support. That’s frankly an insane take.Nobody thinks she’s innocent, they just think there’s a *good enough chance* that she’s innocent that a new trial needs to be done to prove it. The evidence against her is that it’s “statistically likely” she did it. This sets a dangerous precedent, so anyone who doesn’t want “statistically likely” to be the new standard of proof will want to donate toward a new trial.Somehow I feel this point will still not be grasped so here’s an example. Several bodies are found stabbed to death over the span of a few months. Each time, security footage shows the same man walking within a couple blocks. But no bloody clothes, no DNA evidence, no murder weapon are ever linked to him. He’s found guilty based on the statistical likelihood that he did it. I think he *probably* did do it, but “statistical likelihood” means nobody is 100% certain and shouldn’t be enough to convict people. So I donate toward a new trial so they can hopefully produce some more definitive evidence. Now here’s the fun part that I want you to answer honestly: **Do I support people stabbing strangers to death?**
Check out the series on netflix. If i remember correctly, his cover was as a wealthy businessman. You could make friends with politicians and military leaders too if you had an entire government behind you.
There hasnt been anything terrifying on this sub in a while
In the Middle Eastern 60s it’s not weird to think two opposing countries would kill spy’s if they were found out
Strange. I'm neither Syrian nor Israeli but the portrayals you mention never even crossed my mind. A series I watch as entertainment is hardly going to convince me that the ground reality is/was what's running on the screen. While I wouldn't mind absolute historical accuracy it's easy to understand and come to terms with the fact that there'll always be a poetic licence, sometimes for the better.
It's literally the truth and can't in any rational way be disputed though can it? Hardly propaganda
This is so true
Enjoy your spoon fed Hamas propaganda
It's almost like people on reddit don't much care for a power-hungry apertheid state that violently oppresses minorities from the country it illegally occupied.
It’s Reddit, so if you say something that can be interpreted as remotely positive about Israel or something/someone Israeli, you get downvoted
I feel like many actors who can do humor well, can do drama well. Sacha, Robin Williams, Tom Hanks, Jim Carrey, and a few others I can think of at the moment.
The strength of that hook.
I don‘t know why are being downvoted. Even tho he got caught he did a great job for a long time.
International espionage for an apartheid state, nothing really terrifying about this lol
I work in the U.K. and the NHS does not have surveillance. Apart from lack of money it’s probably considered unethical. We have drug rounds and drug charts and use pen and paper. Depending where you work, certain drugs may need two different signatures instead of one.The NHS does not have the finances that private healthcare in other countries may have. Though I did watch a show recently on Netflix based on a nurse injecting IV bags in North America. The hospitals were aware but because they were a ‘business’ first and foremost, they just fired him. He took another job in another hospital and the same thing happened again and again. There’s always pros and cons.*sorry for going off on a tangent there*
This dude was badass
 It's [incredibly biased an inaccurate](https://gulfnews.com/opinion/op-eds/why-the-spy-is-a-blend-of-fiction-and-fable-1.66550503). It also portrays Syrians as idiots, over-sexed and Syrian women as whores while it portrays Israeli men and women as conscientious, family oriented, clever and brave   Its also full of lies too on the most fundamental of points: al hafiz claims never to have met cohen in argentina, and never to have met him or even heard of him prior to the arrest.
How so? I'm not a historian by any means. The series seemed authentic. Nothing about it seems clearly racist.What am I missing?
The series is so clearly racist and propagates bigotry ideas.
So the surname Cohen gave him away?
I wish.
Really surprised me cause I had never seen him in a serious role before, he did amazing
He knew the job was dangerous when he took it.
The thought that you too, at any given moment, could be tried for international espionage.   /s
Nothing
He's brilliant in the role too.
What is so terrifying about this?
It's a very good series!
Sacha Baron Cohen stars in the 6 part Netflix miniseries on thishttps://m.imdb.com/title/tt5952634/
For those wondering what is written on the parchment on Eli Cohen: "In the name of the Arab people of Syria, the special (or exceptional) military court has decided in its session on (day not clear) ## of Muharram 1385 (that's Islamic Hijri calendar date) which corresponds to ## May 1965 to sentence Eliyahu Ben Shaul Jundi Cohen, a resident of Tel Aviv, occupied Palestine, to death by hanging for committing the following crimes:1- Entering undercover a military zone.2- Obtaining information supposed to remain secret for national security to benefit the enemy.He is to be hanged according to articles 158 and 159 of the martial punitive law and articles 271 and 272 of civil punitive law.Final decision certified by and in presence of the President of the Governing (Presidential) Council.17/05/1965"
Mulligan
Jfc that's horrific. That must have been super painful. Hope she ends up in prison with the general population and not some special protective wing.
Her lawyers defence was “someone else did it”.
You don’t have a year long trial and the only evidence is stats.
She pumped air in to the babies stomachs on a lot of them and they got this weird rash while they stopped breathing that no doctor or nurse had ever seen on a baby before that travelled around the body as they watched. The only common denominator was she was on shift every time. In some cases they would spend a long time getting the baby stable, they’d leave, Letby would be put back in charge of the baby and then just minutes later the baby would be in trouble again not breathing or no heartbeat.
Any video from ElectroBoom belongs on this sub 😆
Wind
Probably very heavy crosswinds
Wind shear?
&gt;I think it would help if you told me exactly why you consider donating to this to be malicious. I feel like it has to be one of these, even though none of them really make sense:Normal people don't donate to people's defense if they don't either believe they're innocent OR they don't believe the crime they committed is morally wrong. It's hard for any reasonable person to believe she's innocent so the donations must be coming from the latter.
it happens all the time, what would be scary is if he tried to land even though he messed up
Brilliant reply, you’ve somehow managed to cite something that’s not only an insane comparison but is *also* not boat-worthy. The bottom line here is that some people think “*She probably did it based on statistics, but statistics are not conclusive proof. For it to be fair, she needs a new trial.*”To which you’re saying “*No! You’re bad for disagreeing with me that she 100% did it!*” How are you possibly the good guy here?I think it would help if you told me exactly why you consider donating to this to be malicious. I feel like it has to be one of these, even though none of them really make sense:-Is it that, in cases with the worst crimes, we *shouldn’t* need to be as sure of their guilt as in other cases?-Is it that you think these donators want babies to be murdered, and that’s why they want her to get a new trial?-Is it that you consider anyone who has a higher standard of evidence than you to be a bad person? (I personally expect it to be this one since you think flat earthers are an appropriate comparison. Wrong? Yes. Bad? No. Except apparently that they disagree with you)
The earth isn't obviously round to some people either.
They’re donating because it’s not very obvious, at least not to them. They’re not doing it because they think killing babies is good. So how is that boat worthy?
Well yeah. Or like that baby who was decapitated during the failed vaginal turned c-section. Or any other condition that occurs and no one knows why. But my point relating to the RN who this story is about.
You can do everything right and your baby have some random birth defect, or just not make it through delivery. Doesn’t take a psycho to throw all your plans out the window
Anyone that's white... Is simply forgiven for any and all crimes they commit. Not so much for other races.
Free Hat!
If this was my kid she did this to, she is safer being in prison, because the second she steps out, it's over for her.
"Hi! shhh!" 💀
It’s not the wrong tree- the system is not working as intended, one of the major reasons this country is falling apart.Also just to point out your logic being stupid- 5% chance is 1 in 20. Are you really even the slightest bit okay with 1 in 20 falsely accused people being convicted, cuz I sure as fuck am not
this is the first thing I thought "no way, its gotta be fake" - but then again.. this world seems to know no bounds.
Don't forget all the ones that she attempted to kill but survived.
Well those articles you read were also misleading then.  The notes she had written stated that she 'had guilt' over their deaths.  And that can be taken several ways.  If I were crap at nursing and my patients died, I would also have guilt over it.
No, I I think that’s right. I forgot some were just attempted. Sick.
I think he should have a bit where instead of spazzing out and trying to put out the fires he just deadpans the whole event, watch it all burn, continue his monologue, and wait until some overhead fire sprinklers come on.
She’s going to need to be thrown under the jail for her own safety lest those mothers get to her
7 deaths and another 10 attempted or physically harmed I think. I could be wrong tho
After having a small read through some of Science on Trial website, it is very one sided and they leave out a lot of information. Which is bad science. And they don't even reference correctly.
So many things about this got me mildly annoyed
So many people just love to be contrarians. No matter the subject, no matter the evidence put in front of them they still have to be on the "other side".
Well, it can't be a mere 70. To make it simple to understand, the standard for medical statistics is 95%. Anything less isn't considered significant. Without knowing any more, I would guess it's closer to 99.8% than 70. Why don't you actually read the Stats and state that instead of some number you made up before saying it needs to be thrown out on that basis.**but people have been wrongly convicted on 1 in million odds. You're just barking up the wring tree.
That people are donating to her defense. Would you donate your money to someone who very obviously murdered multiple babies?
Iirc 7 was just the number they could prove, and the actual number was in the hundreds.
[saw it on this bbc article](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-66569311)
Where did you read she was planning 6 more? I've followed this case pretty closely and never heard that before
What is the most damning evidence against her? What method are they accusing her of using to kill the babies? I know of the case and all the peoples reaction to her but I've not heard one thing that put it beyond a shadow of doubt that she did it.
I've just seen a documentary about this, truly sick and evil. They weren't just babies, but tiny premature babies in the ICU, twins and triplets.And she stalked the parent's Facebook profile every anniversary, probably for a sick pleasure in their mourning postsShe should never return to society
And some of us feel giddy when we do something nice for... anyone. I dont understand this behaviour/mindset, and I don't want to.
I bet she felt drunk with power.
Yeah, I read up on it today and was shocked at how long the hospital took to look into it and how they admonished the whistle blowers. So many of those deaths and handicaps she caused could’ve been prevented.
And the unexplained deaths followed her in different hospitals and started when she did and stopped when she left. And she had hospital documents about the babies hidden in her home, had falsified records about the deaths, and a calendar in her home had the initials of all the babies who had sudden deaths and near deaths written in by her.
I read up on this today bc I hadn’t heard of her before. The theory is that she used difficult to trace methods, and the hospital basically didn’t act for so long that proof from autopsies wasn’t available. It would be virtually impossible statistically for her to be on shift for every unexplained incident (29 I think?) and for them to start when she cane to a hospital and stop when she left. And for this pattern to follow her over multiple hospitals. But there were also numerous different ppl with the same suspicion and there was a lot of circumstantial evidence from a lot of people, and she would Google the families afterward, she’d said and done very incriminating things, and she had suspected trophies in her home and the initials of all the babies in a calendar on the days they died.
I read up on it after first seeing this today. There are an awful lot of coincidences that would have to exist for her not to be guilty. But one thing I thought was wierd was that they tried to use things she’d written/said as evidence of her guilt that I don’t think were that at all. For instance, she said something like I killed then because I’m not good enough to take care of them. That could easily be said by anyone who worked there with certain personality types. People with no confidence or self-esteem often feel like they’re the cause of things that go wrong when they aren’t. I felt enormous guilt when one of my dogs got cancer and I found all kinds of ways that I must’ve caused it when in reality I was a starving student yet had her treated by cancer specialists and did all treatments possible and even an extra chemo.
That’s just the convictions. As she used methods that are hard to find in autopsy, and it took so long for the hospital to take action, they couldn’t prove several other beyond a reasonable doubt. They’re also looking into infant deaths at other places she worked and trained.
The article I read said she had notes at her home saying she did it on purpose.  So to say she was convicted on just stats is kind of being misleading.
what do you even do in this situation😂 provided that you had no clue of the ensuing danger

In the US people can be put on Death Row just from an eye witness account.
No I haven't, but I agree with the point you're making. I was more poking fun at the wording
Love this guy lol
Just knowing it was only on her shifts I believe it and have zero reasonable doubts.
They misworded fight against justice… also am I thinking of a different woman or wasn’t it more than 7??
He’s great.
The horn 😆 🤣
They’re having a fundraiser to get a new trial to make sure she’s the one who did it. What part of that is boat-worthy?
If you don’t think she definitely did it, then you shouldn’t have a problem with raising funds to get her a fair trial. How on Earth is it an insult to the families for them to want to make sure they have the right person?
Reddit moment.
Yeah she was doing specific things to not just kill the babies, but to ensure they suffered a lot while they died. She also personally contacted some of the mourning families and frequently viewed their social media profiles. She was getting off on their suffering. Pure evil.
Electro-Boooooom!
“Most likely” is not the standard- literally. The standard is beyond any reasonable doubt. If the evidence says that it’s a 70% probability she did it that is literally a 30% reasonable doubt that she did. Case should have been thrown out by the judge because the jury can’t fuckin read.
If it truly was her, if she did it and there is ample evidence, then not performing an execution would be a "miscarriage of justice".
[This](https://youtu.be/TwIvUbOhcKE?si=TIyTxHravj7ChYYh) was the first video i saw of him
they also moved her around from day to night shift and other things like that to see if the babies would keep dying only on her shifts. they did.
Her being convicted on the basis of stats is a bit of a misconception. There was one table introduced into evidence that showed that the only person on shift for every single event was Letby, but no statistical inference (that I can remember) was drawn from it. It was just to show her presence. What was introduced, was a lot of medical evidence ruling out any other reasonable natural cause. Even NICU babies don’t generally just crash and die suddenly. The commonality among the cases presented at trial was that they were clinically stable at the time of their sudden decline and, in some cases, death. Also notable was the cases where insulin was introduced. Letby herself admitted during her evidence that there was evidently a poisoner active on the ward. Her defence was just that it wasn’t her. No alternatives were suggested. So it’s certainly not accurate to say she was convicted on stats and nothing else. While it’s fair to say there is no smoking gun, and it’s hard to say why any of this happened, it’s only right to acknowledge the huge amount of evidence introduced during the longest murder trial in British history.
What fucks me up is how a woman could do everything right. Eat healthy, take vitamins, exercise, prepare a home for the baby. Baby comes out healthy. And then someone decides to take that away from the mom. You could do everything right and still walk away from that hospital with an empty carrier. Granted she was in a NICU and the babies are sick, but the point still stands.
This dude is a legend
Those where the glourious Liveleak days.
Damn I can’t even get ppl to text me back
Have you had a look at the trial and the evidence? The case has some striking resemblances with the mistrials of [Lucia de Berk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucia_de_Berk?wprov=sfla1) (nurse convicted on the basis of statistical evidence) and [Kathleen Folbigg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kathleen_Folbigg#%3A%7E%3Atext%3DKathleen_Megan_Folbigg_%28n%C3%A9e_Donovan%2Chad_arisen_about_her_guilt.?wprov=sfla1) (wrote in her diary about feeling like she murdered her children, it turned out they suffered from a rare genetic defect).Not saying she's innocent, I wasn't there. However, whether the evidence proves her guilt *beyond reasonable doubt* is a genuine question and I do not find it strange at all that people question her conviction.Now, go ahead and downvote me into oblivion.
This guy makes the funniest videos. No other creator makes me laugh to the point of tears with every single video. God, when he made the bush trimmer gloves I was genuinely afraid for his life, it was fucking gold
Almost did it with the Jacob's Ladder
Apparently after her shifts she’d pop into my mum’s office and be very jovial and happy. There was even a point when she was relocated to the desk next to my mum’s
Yes, because it seems as though this was a false conviction and we should all be fighting against those.
I feel like this is not only not right for this sub, but isn't this a good thing?  They aren't saying she was given in inappropriate sentence, but that the evidence that got the conviction was in some way insufficient.  I don't know about England and how their legal system works, but in the U.S., there's protections for people regardless of what they did, so that everything is fair.  I don't know what's happened, and more importantly, what evidence was used and how it was used, but in the U.S., mistrials are a thing.  It doesn't matter, as long as something could have effected the outcome, I think even sentencing, that was not appropriate, you can appeal for a retrial.
I know all of this is staged but it doesn't make it any less chaotic or hilarious
It’s not boat worthy. It’s an appeal. It’s almost routine for anyone to appeal a conviction.For the record, there have been cases of parents convicted of shaking their baby to death based on the opinion of a medical expert who was later discredited. This “organisation” (still probably started by her friends), is arguing on the same basis that medical evidence was misinterpreted.https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1382290/amp/At-half-parents-tried-shaken-baby-syndrome-wrongly-convicted-expert-warns.htmlI personally think she’s guilty, but people wanting an appeal (based on similar miscarriages of justice based on the evidence of the prosecution’s chosen medical expert) isn’t out of the ordinary nor is it that alarming.
Those are not her family and friends. If you read the paragraph to the bottom right,  there's a literal organization raising money to fund her lawyers and her appeal.
He keeps his funny extinguisher next to his real one and that made me laugh.
[For anyone who isn't up to date on her story](https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-merseyside-66569311)
If you think that’s crazy, check out nils H https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niels_HögelVictims 85-300 . We don’t know. And the most disturbing thing was the investigation who didn’t want to know.
So this is what people don’t understand. It’s not about the crime somebody committed it’s actually about keeping the state and the law system upright and grant a fair trial within the rules which goes for the prosecution and the defendant. You can’t take rights away and bend laws only to get a conviction. I sit 236 days innocent in jail before fully acquitted and awarded compensation (in Germany). I could hate the law system for putting me even in that situation, but it’s also the law system that got me out.
It depends on where you work, but pretty much every hospital in first world countries have key card access to many medications. Patients charts are also easily monitored. They also suspected her before she was fired and tried so I'm assumimg she had a lot of oversight/surveillance in the hospital.
Any specific event?if you're comfortable sharing?
what a cook....He's less reliable than a scared woman when in need
Me aswell
I remember the first time I watched this. I must have laughed for 10 straight minutes.
He absolutely did. Off camera to light it. Still comedy gold, though.
Heh. I knew this was the air horn clip before playing it.
Not in any hospitals I’ve worked in…
There will always be someone out there looking to profit on tragedy. Likely what ever funds raised would go into someones pocket
u/savevideobot
That sounds like a complete nightmare
My mum actually worked alongside this woman for 6 months and was friends with her. I remember all the workplace rumours before this case even went public
"miscarriage" of justice. Lmao, you sure this isn't a joke?
Who’s “they”? It’s pretty routine for some people, especially family and friends, to not believe when someone is convicted of a crime. An appeal is their right, it doesn’t have to be accepted 🤷‍♂️
She should probably be in an Insane Asylum for the rest of her life instead of a prison.
I agree if it's all just stats, while damming I'm not sure it's worth a conviction in and of itself. But hospitals track some things very thoroughly like medication taken out of inventory by the nurse, time in, time out, time spent in a room, time looking at records etc. Hospitals often track employees very carefully, like crazy carefully with sensors in the room that automatically pick up your badge ID to register everywhere you go. I believe they used those sorts of things in the trial (not 100% because i didn't follow super close) and if that's true they can have a very solid case.
I know they said "physical assault" (I'm not sure exactly what age did), injecting air and/or insulin into their tubes, and force-feeding them
It most likely was her. People can petition for an appeal but she will get one anyway. It has no chance of succeeding. No home secretary is going to release her from the whole life tarriff she has been given. Ever. What needs to happen now is prosecuting the managers who allowed this to go on for so long. Doctors do not accuse colleagues of killing people for the lolz. The managers need to be jailed, the salary given during that time taken back, their pensions removed and an accountability system put in place to deal with these fuckheads going forward.More often than not the non-clinical people in charge just move to another trust with a salary bump when this shit happens. It needs to end.
So what's the story on what she actually did? Did she just walk into the room and crush baby heads, like what actually happened, whats the lore?
Personally I think this might well be an 'unsafe' conviction.  She was (as far as i can work out) convicted on a statistical probability given as evidence.Don't get me wrong, she probably did do it, and she should suffer for killing babies.  But 'probably' shouldn't be the criteria for a life sentence.    It feels like only half the work was done, and the hospital seems like it knew more than it was saying.    Nobody should be raising funds for her though, thats an insult to the families.
We need to report this
You really need to know your shit to create safe accidents that looks like rael accidents.
&gt; His one with the Jacob’s Ladder.Yeah i found it and watched it, dangerous stuff
He's so great! Luv it!

Hahaha thanks for the support
sometimes you just put your voice out there man, and don't care about the votes. It's a pretty good feeling, and that's coming from someone who likes this guys antics.
Electro-Boom and Abrupt Chaos is about as redundant as you can get. LMFAO
Yeah, grabbing a burning plastic object....
Ohhhh yes please!!
Lol wasn't expecting anything else from reddit
The very same, from the old country.
Electroboom
I love how his glove gets absolutely shredded by the end.
Of the Massachusetts Cringey-Exaggerateds?
He deliberately demonstrates a bad idea in a relatively controlled scenario and it'll always catch fire or spark, then immediately cuts to him explaining why you should never do that.
sorry you’re being downvoted, i agree with you. i didn’t find it funny either. maybe it’s for kids lol
Him saying "Why do bad things happen to good people?" seconds before it falls over and he grabs it is hilarious lol
/r/OopsDidntMeanTo
He's like the Mr Bean of electronics
It's like he dropped it on a pile of flash paper...
My great grandfather died in an honor duel. It's not something to joke about...
I'll have you know that my grandmother was cringey-exaggerated, and I challenge you to a duel at dawn in her honor. You will pay for slandering our people.
I think it’s time for my yearly Electroboom binge watch, thanks for the reminder
Yeah his channel is mostly him doing bits but I think there was one time he genuinely almost killed himself
Comedy isn't all the same. Some stand up comedians are fantastic and funny, others way less. At least for me? Am I entitled to an opinion, based on my subjective taste?Damn, it looks like I insulted everyone's mother, given the reaction lmao
It's a bit of lighthearted fun. People can enjoy whatever they want and I think you feeling embarrassed for his almost 6m subscribers says more about you to be honest.It's not my cup of tea, but I'm sure a lot of my interests would bore most people to death.
Does it? Like a comedy bit, perhaps?
Air horn, origins:https://youtu.be/aDGlWzVLEbs?t=131
See you there lmao
great episode
Never said his videos aren't informative.Interesting, yes, funny... Meh, not really
How have you not been downvoted to oblivion for saying it like it is?
faked but funny
Im sorry, you got tangled in my "downvote of doom" circle lol
Well, yes, all I'm saying is that it takes a very very small proportion of amps to volts to make that happen. Technically you can't even have one without the other.
Got EXTREMELY close lol
I'm also an electrician, which is why I've never, and would never fuck with a microwave transformer. Transformers are weird. Give me standard wire, even in 600-2000A range an im ok with it, because I understand it. It's a constant. Transformers though... I know the math behind them, but at the same time I don't. I've wired them up, but once everything is turned on and tests out fine, I leave them alone.
That's how you stay calm under pressure
[This is my go-to video of his, how to change the brake pads in your car](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A129SM9S54A)
Mehdi (the guy in the video) has a video debunking the idea that it's one or the other, amps or volts. It's both. You need enough voltage to overcome the resistance of your skin and enough amps to overload the nerves in your heart. You *also* need the electricity to take a path through your heart, which you can often avoid. AC v DC matters, because bodies have capacitive properties that allow AC to flow at lower voltage than DC. In the other hand, if the frequency of the AC is low enough or high enough, it won't hurt you until the voltage is *so* high that it simply burns you to death. Point being, it's complicated. The other point being, a Jacob's ladder requires high voltage AC and there's no limit on the amp draw so it's more than enough to kill you. Also, he grabbed the conductors with each hand, creating a path through his heart. He didn't die because a connection broke, and also the breaker did its job correctly and tripped.
Amps do not kill you,just like volts do not kill you. It is a very common misconception. It is the COMBINATION of amps and volts that kills you.
A microwave transformer will easily kill you no problem.Just look up fractal burning fatalities.Don't fuck with electricity, it'll kill you. Sincerely, an electrician.
yeah if his clips hadn't failed he would be toast
Electroboom'e [electric guitar one](https://youtu.be/TwIvUbOhcKE?si=FmxdQqaj6WHciksW) is still my favorite.
yeah he's acting for comedy. its his YT format.
what was his channel again? god its funny
National treasure
The horn got me good
Maybe. Maybe not. Volts do not kill you, amps do. Granted, it takes a very small fraction of an amp to kill you, and he was using a microwave transformer, so I couldn't say how many amps. However, I've touched a million volts before, and while it hurt like hell and made me fall, it wouldn't have killed me. This is the basic principle of tazers/stun guns. An important thing to remember about amps though: what kills most people in a short jolt is the electricity traveling across your heart, thus stopping it. This is also the basic principle of the defibrillator.EDIT: good God reddit, I was just trying to make a layman's explanation behind amps and volts before I go to bed after a long day. You cannot have amps without volts, and thus vice versa. But a very small amount of amps compared to volts can kill you, just like a very large amount of volts to amps can kill you. I'm an electrician. So basically just don't fuck with electricity at all.
I like it. He shows you what happens if it goes wrong. He usually ends up hurting himself and showing you why you shouldn't do it without just saying "don't do this it's bad"
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lT3vGaOLWqENotice [his hands shaking](https://youtu.be/lT3vGaOLWqE?t=482) after the ladder falls on him.  He's pumped full of adrenaline because he knows what potentially could have happened.[He also commented about this video](https://www.reddit.com/r/ElectroBOOM/comments/7gnt46/that_jacobs_ladder_video/dqn8jpp/) on Reddit.
It's funny to think that people who don't know who he is would see clips like this on reddit and think he's just an idiot, when the reality of it is that he's a very intelligent electrical engineer.
Still baffles me how i passed some tests because of his videos...
Is it just me or does the censoring actually make it funnier?  It feels like if it wasn't censored it wouldn't be as funny.
r/darwinawards
Yeah they were funny when i was a kid. Now, not so much
Yeah I like him but I don't find it funny at all.
Netflix should've looked at him before remaking Cowboy Bebop.
How hasn’t he accidentally killed himself yet? He’s really is built different

His one with the Jacob’s Ladder.Effectively it’s two posts where a high voltage arc will jump from one side to the other and ‘climb’ up it (Guessing that it’s because it heats up air around it pushing it up)But his home made one fell over on him and he grabbed both sides with either hand. Not a good idea around high voltage.Man is amazing though, spent way longer than I’d care to admit watching his videos.
Jacob's ladder that he made with a high voltage transformer. It started falling over while energized and he instinctively grabbed it. He got very lucky.
I am aware of that! But it makes it less "funny" to me. It's interestinf, but i don't find his antics funny 😅
"Making a Jacob's Ladder to Celebrate a Million Subs!"
he dropped a jacob's ladder and grabbed the metal bits as it fell
It was the Jacob’s ladder one.I believe it is [this](https://youtu.be/lT3vGaOLWqE?si=-0bZLefbo-CRBUKj)
It's intentional. His videos are pretty informative but there's a big element of over the top theatre to them.

The tiny flame on top of the microwave is so funny to me
Which one was that
i don't know. seems a bit cringey-exagerated tbh
What an idiot.
Except the one where he really could’ve died. But I love watching his videos lol.
His YouTube channel is called ElectroBOOM.
Yup he has a master's degree in Electrical Engineering
The fuck has he got a horn next to him for 😂
can you link it? i dont know his name so cant find it
This guy...
Medhi is definitely one of my favorite youtubers. The guy has some crazy interesting videos up.
Only survived cause his shitty cable connections came loose.
He basically decided to do "safe" mistakes to teach about electricity. It works surprisingly well. But many of the things he does are actually painful.Basically he does it so we won't.
Love that guy
He mastered his craft to the level he can actually create a controllable chaos.GENIUS!
In effect, he accidentally shut the engines down. The plane would have been left with no power.
Even better. "Where is it!?" 😂
Although the Jacob's Ladder incident almost did him in for real. That was genuinely terrifying.
He’s an electrical engineer. He knows how to do these skits safely, but he is probably legitimately hurting himself in the process lol.
That one was real shit going actually wrong. He did not mean to set his ass on fire.
My favorite is the heated chair one. Fucking kills me.
Is this guy a real klutz, or a skit actor for views?  I've seen this guy do real dumb things, always hurting himself.  One can't be this dumb, can one?
I'm shocked he hasn't ever actually caught the house on fire doing these skits, he's such a god of chaos.
That's the kind of shit you see on cartoons. It was so funny!
The air horn is hilarious. I'm gonna steal that joke.
Ah yes the Rat school of security https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2ePBNGmxVK8
How does he have any functioning brain cells left
bro became Oppenheimer for a minute there
Don't worry. He knows exactly what he's doing and pushes his stunts as far as he can while staying relatively safe. This guy is a genius.
The endless beeping spoils it for me.
Electroboom is such a great channel. Love this guy
That honk was amazing
The Fire Department of his hometown llooooove him
Margaret Thatcher?
No, he knows exactly what he's doing.
Fumbler found
This is my equivalent of trying to solve math equations...
He's an electrical engineer. He does this shit cause its hilarious
Metro boomin make it boom
I adore this man, he's so funny and wholesome
This guy is brilliant
*”Hooonk”*
My son calls him “boom guy”, he’s fantastic!
Only 2 seconds to create a fire hazard? Insane.
I love this guy
Is It A Good Idea To Microwave This?
Butterfingers.
Lol. WTF?! That was amazing. Thanks!
What does this mean?
Well IDK how can someone unintentionally turn on a cam and start recording
The microwave. Still my favorite way to wipe data from a CD.
One of my favorite YouTube channels. The dude is hilarious.
Thanks for that I needed a laugh 😂
Electroboom is a genius
That guy is GOOD!
Fwuh-fwu-fwu-fwu
It’s funny
Excellent :)
I lasted until the air horn was blown instead of the fire extinguisher. Proceeded to laugh to the point of out of body experience. This guy is a gem.
The goat
[this is still my favorite](https://youtu.be/TwIvUbOhcKE?si=P5bQ0MJRuM5gakpH)
Electroboom is cheating.
This guy intentionally does this in all of his videos
Yea, this guy is an electric engineer or some shit who has been making these videos for years and years.
Charging for a disabled person to use a wheelchair?? That is really low man.
It's this kind of menatlity that keeps me from moving to America, seems like Americans dont value any life that isn't their own, it's a very offputting character trait.
Yes, they also blame the sharks in the sea and the falcons in the skies for working with the Mossad. LMAO
Palestinian dude on video shoots at Palestinian Police, enjoy.

the problem is that one side supports the guys that were in power who recently left, while the other support the guys currently are in power but left a while ago, thats why they are there clashing after leaving
![gif](giphy|l0ErwjU56k2sNrSJa|downsized)That dude looks a lot like Waymond from workaholics
That made me cry fuck
they sided against Israel?
There were also however many people on the opposite side of the building who got ejected along with the debris and explosion just sitting at their desks or gabbing at the water cooler that didn't die in the initial impact.
As someone who graduated high school in 2001, I've been fairly entrenched in 9/11 stuff for my entire adult life, and I've never seen this story.  I will add it to the heap of horrible things I read and watched on that event, with a shiver of the goosebumps and that general complete lack of apetite/knot that comes with it.
When you sided with the pseudostate founded by a dude in a stupid hat who had tea and pretzels with Hitler. There are photos of this, if you would like them.
When did I start?
My first thought too.People will be shooting back at the place, and you are the back stop.
Have you stopped throwing gay people off of buildings yet?
Girls?  I thought only men liked that!
🥰
Glad to help ❤️
spoken like a true facist lmao.
legit red vs blue
Nice job recording instead of doing anything useful
This is some great victim blaming
Definitely the most awesome earth movement I've ever seen.
No, it's nothing but yet another act of an imperialist occupier trying to murder a native of the country. And for all her murderous efforts, the colonialist Arab regime will pay her money from it's so called martyr's fund for as long as she is imprisoned. The world must not abide by Arab imperialist any more than it did by European imperialism. Just as the Europeans left India, Kenya and Algeria, so too must the Arabs leave Israel, Kurdistan, and Darfur.
Well, now we all know that. Thanks to the title….
A desperate act from someone with no hope left. Forever FUCK IS(not)RAEL and IDF
I knew there was a reason I liked you @Dismal_Wallaby9723! Everything you've mentioned is spot on. And witnessed with my own eyes as well. To the naysayers and "but what about" people. Most uncultured or untraveled people only wear "the glasses" of their own backyard. And then, like jackasses, scrutinize others based on their tiny little bubble of understanding.Your normal isn't everyone's normal. The sun shining in your window doesn't mean the whole world is aglow. There is dark on the other side.When you have been out in a large field with no protection and you hear air raid sirens. And see an unprovoked rocket speeding towards a farming village outside the city. Your perspective on things changes... rapidly. Or a bus blows up at a market intersection you were shopping in 20 minutes earlier. Your perspective changes.But, go ahead, naysayers. Please continue to regurgitate all those little talking points you heard someone else say on some show that was on some channel. And consider yourself lucky to be so sheltered and safe and have such gripping recycled opinions about a place, a region, and people you have no clue about.
I understand the religion and the region. Spent a whole lotta time there. And I am very familiar with all their customs, religious practices, and deep, deep traditions. I'm absolutely amazed and fascinated every time I've been invited to work and teach in Jerusalem. But Jerusalem doesn't shut down on Saturday. It doesn't "shutter-up" the disco's because of the alcohol.And the Ultra Orthodox Jews...if they saw kids acting like that to anyone.... The elders are ten times more concerned about the actions of their own people than someone else doing their job. I've seen it so many times. And it isn't just a sturn "talking to". It's pretty harsh punishment. To them, respect is respect is respect. Honestly, unless the city deems something illegal or to be observed by everyone within the city, the Jews and Christians have very few problems. (Silght adjustment: LOCAL Jews and Christians have very few problems. Tourists on the other hand.)And I think we both pretty much agree. What the video shows and what the full story is may be miles apart. And there's nothing to support any claims made. This is a region I know and love dearly. And the people, all of them, are as amazing as the soils they live on. I have never personally seen any kids act like this any time I've been there. Most of the time, they are super reserved (seen not heard mentality) and more often with adults. Which is why the video shocked me a bit. And the statement about being "unattended" and having a "stick". Everyone wanted to jump on saying "abuse abuse."
There goes the neighborhood
I just talk to him like a person, but with extra love and of course, I simplify things for his age.
Serious question, though... when you "reason" with your six year old, what voice do you use? The "widdle biddy baby" voice, or are you talking like a bank manager on a defunct loan? I've got a feeling it isn't the bank manager. And I'm sure many of your "reason" talks are about the same things over and over. Or variations of that subject. You probably think of it as a partnership, too. Therefore, you aren't the parent or an authority figure in the household. Just wait... Source:  Husband of 35 years and raised four kids. With both parents having PhD's .(one of agricultural science, the other in medical/behavioral science) Who raised all their children with love, respect, disciple, dedication, faith. And did I mention love. That's the most important, you see. Now, our kids have families of their own. And when they don't directly tell us "Thank you," they show it in how they raise their kids.
Not necessarily… all people are welcome in Jerusalem, so long as they respect each other… preaching to a devout religious person is not respectful. They should be left to practice their beliefs…And you have to bare in mind, we’re talking about ultra Orthodox Jews… people who won’t work or use any electronics on a sabbath never mind a high holy day… they use lights on timers so as not to “create a spark” as even that is seen as work… her preaching was/is probably seen as heresy…Edite: not defending the little brats at all… just pointing out there opinion, right or wrongEdit 2: but I completely agree with your second statement! ❤️
Yeah, 'cause Jews are so unaccepting of Christians in Jerusalem.... if it was a holy day, they wouldn't be doing half the thing you see going on in the video.But, I also think this video is totally mislabeled, or at least the story behind this isn't genuine. And in Jerusalem, everyone can take all your "the children need to be reasoned with" and "hitting your kids is abuse" thinking and realize the reality of where this is. These kids live in a world of air raids, bus bombings and vicious attacks constantly. There is a feeling of numbness and questioning a tomorrow. So yeah, I agree 100%. You don't ever abuse your kids. Full stop. You teach, guide, and discipline them. And love every moment you get with them.
Right. I didn't say abuse them. Obviously, your reading skills are lacking. I said, discipline them. Do you know what it feels like to be hit in the arm? Probably. And you know that because someone did it to you. And you know how it feels and it isn't good.When you discipline a child. You don't just walk in and start wailing on them. That's abuse, and you should be locked away. Having an explanation about actions and consequences, explaining why you don't harm others, and providing an example. That's called discipline. To stop this behavior and correct it is showing the love you have in them now. And more importantly, who they will become.
Nah, to add insult to injury, apparently this happened on a high holy day (for the Jews) and the missionaries actions were not only inappropriate/un wanted but it was also seen as “work” which is a big deal to Jews of this calibre… again not excusing their actions
How far back in time do you want to go? Israelis owned it before Arabs existed.
Understanding why they did it and condoning it are two different things. I didn’t condone it.
Right right... kinda looks like they should have been in school at the time this video was taken. Something tells me that education isn't really a high priority to them...Or, who knows. Maybe they caught these kids on an off day. A one in a million instance where loving peaceful kiddo just decided one day to act out. Could be...
Never said hitting your kid. I said, discipline your kids.
So, which one of those kids in the video is yours?(This is sarcasm just in case you're more irrationally enraged enough to realize.)
Oh thanks man I wasn't sure
I agree, but most of those people weren’t raised the way they were… I wasn’t, you clearly weren’t… yet you understand how someone could be, right? Again, I myself am Jewish but I don’t share their beliefs but I’m pretty sure that is due to my (relatively) decent education…That’s what’s lacking here, education.
Is this Venus?
So… you are saying it’s ok to hit children…Right… you’re a severely flawed individual and don’t deserve to draw breath… I can’t believe I need to say this but there’s no acceptable reason for a grown adult to beat a child. End of.
Why can’t people have a normal fetish?
Noone cares that they join the army lol. And if these kids are happy to assault an adult then they can be happy to get what they deserve
I’m not saying that, but there are people in the comments basically saying that this behavior is expected because they are Jewish
When you added "but" inbetween saying it wasn't right and blaming this person for being in a public place on a day of the week.
Jews don't get to act like assholes just cause they're jews
Not everyone has their mind shrouded in ignorance
How would you deal with an apartment block deep in enemy territory controlled by insurgents… it’s damn near impossible and very rare they send the idf into Gaza because they are guaranteed casualties… plus you don’t know who’s friendly and who’s a potential threat in a situation like that it’s a logistical nightmare! I don’t think it’s right to call in an air strike but the options are limited…
Yeah, I have heard of them. But like you said, it is a jewish state created specifically as a home land for the jewish people. They dont exactly treat the arab israelis as equals, despite the fact that they are equal on paper. In fact, the only reason they were ever given nominal equal rights is because at the outset, arab israelis made up a majority. Now, they are a minority. https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-know-about-arab-citizens-israel and the increasingly reactionary government in israel is worsening that relationship. I call it an ethno state because they are basically ethnically cleansing the Palestinians out of lands they agreed not to occupy, restricting the fishing zones (gaza's main source of food) and other food and supplies from getting into the Gaza strip. None of those examples you provided further your point at all. None of them were created by an international committee for the express purpose of giving a specific ethnic or religous group a homeland. There are no analogous examples anywhere else on the planet.
Alright I can't really disagree with what you're saying.As a closure I just want to point out that if the lions better go vegan like that Tofu lion from futurama.
I’m not “discriminating”, I just think it’s offensive behaviour and borderline racist…I’d like to point out (as I’ve had to many times on this post) I don’t agree with the children either… but if you walk into a lions den who’s fault is it when you get bit? Play stupid games win stupid prizes… I’m was just overly aggressive because of all the racism in the comments and was being very blunt about my opinion…
One are terrorists, they don’t have a geneva convention to follow, or morals. The other is a State, you should act accordingly.
Ask the Arabs that were there before who’s land it is…
Bro it's not a negative dick measuring competition, period. If something is wrong, it's wrong.Jerusalem is holy in all the Abrahamic religions, and last time I checked, public speech is a thing in public places, so I don't think we should discriminate against someone for this.
Just that the kid’s reaction would be considered tame compared to what would happen over the border…And no, it’s no acceptable behaviour from anyone. I wouldn’t go to the Vatican and start telling people Jesus was a false prophet and to return to Judaism… that shits just disrespectful… she had no right preaching to ultra Orthodox Jews in their homeland like that… Jerusalem is a holy place to several religions, the only way we can ever hope for peace is if people respect others and practice their faith independently.
What the hell does Gaza has to do with anything? Are you saying it's alright for me and wrong for thee?
And instead of taking over some random country , that bit did make me laugh , that was very kind of them
I just thought I’d boil it down for you…Im kinda over this now and am currently trying to watch the last season of jack Ryan but my phone keeps going off with and all I’m dealing with is racism and I Cba… I got a long day ahead of me and after spending most of the night dealing with this shit I kinda just feel like I’m talking to a brick wall…That last comment was the heavily edited and nicest way I could put it… but please tell me I’m wrong.That those things wouldn’t happen if Israel was an Arab state. Look at how Afghanistan changed within days of the west pulling out. Women were forced to sell their businesses, step down from managerial positions and sign things over to their husbands or a male relative or risk losing everything! Not to mention the fact that little girls can no longer go to school with fearing for their lives… but no, Isreal is the bad guy… smh
you knew its a shit hole when some one habe a gun fight and people just minding them own businesses
Strange title. Good video of a landslide. I hope the house was empty.
Hmmm I was feeling like we were having an interesting conversation but somehow despite me constantly reiterating that I believe everyone is capable of terrorism, your take away is that I’m a racist who supports religious zealots and the subjugation of the lgbtq+ community and women. Man, I just pity you for deciding to be so fanatically dense. Peace and love, dude.
"Hello. I'd like to change my home insurance policy to boat insurance please"
Not at all… but in this particular case it’s the lesser of two evils is it not?By siding with the Arabs on this your saying Israel, sorry Palestine, should just be yet another Arab state… one where homosexuals and women who cheat on their husbands deserve the death penalty…Israel currently has some of the best healthcare IN THE WORLD, healthcare that even isis leaders would not refuse their daughters, yet they forbid it of the rest of their followers… how long do you reckon that’ll be the case in an Arab state?
Ok so going back to my previous point about the western wall… Judaism is a good thousand years older than Islam… soooo who’s land is it really?And again it’s the only Jewish state in existence!How many Arab states are there again? Talking about land grabs… the only islamic claim to Israel is a mosque… the western wall is Jews equivalent to Mecca. The Jews claim kinda outweighs the Islamic one don’t ya think?And once again war is never pretty… once again Israel has tried to remedy that in the past… where’s the Arab treaties for peace in the Middle East? Oh yeah… there isn’t any… not one!
So terrorism is less evil to you when government sanctioned and carried out by a state’s military force? Very interesting.That’s definitely a perspective that I’m good with not getting.
I am at a loss for what this title is trying to convey.
You mean Jewish people from all over the world displacing the people that having been living there for mabey a 1000t ears or more , them Jewish people , the ones just deciding to grab more and more land and houses for themselves,  them Jewish people
So the Israelis haven’t proposed multiple different ways of carving up the Jewish homeland, the only Jewish state IN THE WORLD, to appease the Arab people??? I count at least 7…And if they want peace so bad why is it always Israel calling for ceasefires?A few years ago 2020/21 Israel called for a ceasefire and the Islamic extremists launched HUNDREDS of rockets across the border in the hours leading up to said ceasefire… and Israel hardly batted an eye!God bless the invention of the C-ram! 🤣🤣https://youtube.com/shorts/zRgBQaU1QG8?si=5cUoqtlI3DpaBPaJ
If you read my replies on other comments you’ll see that I have mentioned war crimes carried out by Americans… and I’ve stated multiple times that I don’t agree with how the Israelis handle a lot of situations. And no, I don’t believe that Arabs are the only ones capable of terrorism however as much as I don’t agree with the actions of Israel they are government sanctioned… carried out by a military force not a militia or disgruntled individuals, claiming a holy war.If you go into Gaza and ask who people who they are most afraid of they’d likely say one of the extremist groups who cause the issues as apposed to the IDF… unless of course they have ties to said groups. Again we’re comparing the bombing of a medical centre set up and funded by insurgents so they can launch missiles from the roof to 9/11 or the London bombings… get some perspective
Yeah "coexist with" I like that one , I was due a laugh this morning
I don’t see anyone saying “it’s all Jews.” Why are you getting so defensive over people just pointing out that your assertion that a Jewish person has never been a terrorist is incorrect? Want to throw around the racist card? Look at you, implying the only type of war crimes that qualify as “terrorism” are those that have been conducted by Arabs.US soldiers have also committed acts of terror. I’m not about to pretend any of their more heinous actions are warranted or justifiable acts of war just because I am also American. In Iraq, coalition forces directly killed an estimated 13,000-14,000 civilians, so in loss of innocent life, essentially committing 4.5 9/11s. Using fear to subjugate innocent people and committing acts of wanton violence against innocent people is terrorism regardless of who does it.
You mean the people that the Israelis have tried to coexist with on multiple occasions… the same people that launched HUNDREDS of rockets across the border in the hours leading up to A CIES-FIRE! The ones who’s extremists would see the Jewish people and their homeland erased from history books… The western wall is likely the oldest building in Jerusalem and you want to argue it’s ownership…C’monIn order for you to tell the truth that would mean you’d have to be educated on the subject which judging by your “intelligent” comment YOU ARE NOT.Lol when you think you’re talking truth but really your just talking shit 🤪
But what about the people that where already living there ?? And no I'm not edgy , just telling the truth
No, you are still wrong…Israel is a very welcoming place tho those who want to live in harmony… and comparing them to nazis is just flat out disgusting. But I get the feeling you already know that… you edgy bastard you 😉🙄😒
No just the ones in Jerusalem,  like I said and not all but most of them
When Israel is facing constant terrorist threats that are most, of not all countries, worst nightmare the comparison is outrageous to me. And I would never try to justify those actions from any country but quite frankly the horrific actions of Israel pale in comparison to those of the Islamic extremists… and I would never say “it’s all Arabs” but people shouldn’t be trying to make out “it’s all Jews” ffs acting like any of the examples above come anywhere near atrocities like 9/11 or the London bombings is utterly absurd!
This is earth though
I know right… it was as subtle as our take over of Hollywood… and the banks… and media in general…Spend a little less time online and pick up a book or better yet do some travelling, witness culture and see these things for yourself
Same happened to me and I agree!Child abuse is never the answer!
Child, go fetch me a switch…What is this, didn’t realise we were still in the early 90’s… I agree with your sentiment but child abuse is never the answer… these kids need educating!
Another person with some common sense and human decency! Thank you! As much is I disagree with the actions of those children these comments are disgraceful and people should be ashamed of themselves!
This entire post glorifies violence/suffering harassment! Not to mention the fuckin racism!This is meant to be a comedy sub… these mods are lacking to say the least!
Again… all Israelis join the army at 18… so make sure nobody catches you… Their behaviour IS disgusting but child abuse is fucking deplorable, you cretinous wretch
Okay… try this shit in Gaza… see how far you get
Throw the Jew down the well!
Ikr! I usually enjoy the lighthearted comedy of this page but this is disgusting!In the words of borat “throw the Jew down the well” 😉
Any post that even remotely resembles Zionism is getting bashed and down voted so I just wanna say I appreciate your input
Just PRAY there’s nobody over the age of 18 nearby when you do so… ALL Israelis join the army at 18 and you’re probably gonna get your ass handed to you.Regardless of how horrible their actions they are children ffs! You are a cretinous, child abusing monster
However I feel it necessary to point out that they ARE welcome, as are all beliefs, so long as the don’t try push their religion on other people…
It’s not excusable… but neither is being in a relatively religious country and not respecting its religion…People don’t go to Iran for a big gay holiday, filled butt sex now do they? Hint, homosexuality is still illegal there due to religious beliefs
Try this shit in Afghanistan and they’d probably chop her up, make a video and use it to further their radical terrorist agenda
Everyone joins the army at 18… this is not advisable…
Now replace Jerusalem with any Arab country and you’ll realise how racist that sounds…
Yes and no… I’m Jewish but I don’t hate/ judge anyone based on their religious beliefs, skin tone or ethnic background… I only judge people on their words and actions… and I can safely say I do not stand with these nasty, poorly educated little children.
There’s no religious requirement to live in Israel… you’ve heard of Arab Israelis, right? Not to mention the number of Christian’s who live there harmoniously… as well as the other countless beliefs held by Israelis… it might be a Jewish state but in the same sense that England and America are Christian or Afghanistan is Islamic… no wait that last one was a bad example…
Whoa dude, it’s not you personally that’s being hated on, it’s your insinuation that a Jew has never committed an act of terrorism that everyone’s responding to. Sorry that’s triggering to you but literally every state, religious or otherwise, has and will commit acts of terror. Israel is no different.
Also I’d like to mention that I’ve been to Isreal and spent time on the border… I’ve seen this shit firsthand not learned about it on the news or from other forms of media that ALL have their own agenda…Wanna talk shit, I can do this all day every day. BUT unless you have firsthand experience keep your racism to yourself
Not all… but it is hard to distinguish in those conditions.My “favourite” example is when people mention Isreal bombing medical centres in Gaza… the same medical centres that are set up by insurgents so they can launch rockets from the rooftops in “relative safety”.What’s Isreal supposed to do??? Juts slow that shit??? C’mon 🙄
Lol not at all… I don’t agree with the politics of military actions of Israel but I do understand the necessity to defend the one and only Jewish state in the entire world… especially when there’s literally dozens of Islamic countries… most of which have issues with poverty, slavery, women’s rights etc…Imagine the Catholic Church trying to claim Mecca under the reasoning “we are all gods children”. It wouldn’t happen, it would be an outrage. Isreal is the birthplace of Judaism and they are not only entitled but OBLIGATED to defend it from any and all threats. Especially those who would see our entire religion erased if they had things their way.I would never claim to know everything about all religions (I barely even follow my own) but remind me, which of the Islamic prophets stated “if a person does not believe in the word of Islam then educate them, if they then continue to not believe in the word of Islam then let them be for it is for Allah alone to judge them” or something to that that effect… not a direct quote and probably paraphrased but you get the point…
That's it, honey, I've had enough of the neighbours!!! we moving all the land and the house out into the sea!
Riiight… and as AWFUL and utterly deplorable those actions are… they aren’t technically “terrorism”…Example 1 is disgusting but it happens all over the world… and isn’t something done by Jews alone… and not all Israelis ARE Jewish… do you know the religious beliefs of the judge who prosecuted this man? Mister know it all.Example 2 is a flat out war crime. Just like when American soldiers were recording themselves urinating on the corpses of arab insurgents… so again not something only done by Jews/Israeli’sThe las example is just tragic and extremely unfortunate… those soldiers weren’t to know of his disabilities… and even if they did, in a war torn state they have to ask themselves “is this man faking to lure us into a false sense of security” look at George Floyd… the bottom line there is regardless your mental disability, mental state or general mind set, LISTEN TO THE MAN WITH THE GUN! That’s like saying it’s acceptable for an autistic person to shout “BOMB” in an airport and saying “it’s fine, they have learning difficulties” forgetting the stress and alarm they are causing the other passengers and security forces… there’s just some things you shouldn’t do. DeathByLathe, engage your brain and stop with the racism and victim mentality… it’ll make you a happier person… maybe…
L’chaim
Windmill windmill, for the land…
The fuck is this title?  Yeah no shit, gravity exists elsewhere
was this mars or venus?
This is terrifying. Cause where the hell do you even run to? This is like the earth saying fuck you and your house specifically.
Or you could shut tf up, dude. Maybe it’s their land because it’s Israel and they’re Israeli. If you don’t like what I’m saying, why do you keep responding to me? Nothing that I’ve said has been factually incorrect, so my logic is irrelevant.
And I thought this kind of stuff only happened in backwater discord channels.
That house held its own 😂
And i saw my reflection near the snow covered hills
Imagine living in that house and you’re just taking a nap.
Didn't watch much of the video and assumed the tourist was male, but I'm still thinking that she had a history of doing awful stuff back home while using her religion as an excuse, and tried to pull the same shit in the place she fantasized about.
Dude was probably a Christofascist with a history of raping and possibly murdering kids, so this might be payback for both past actions and anything he tried to do to these kids in particular.
That's quite the post title, lol.  Then attaches a video from Norway, *nice*.
This is in Norway🫣
But they’re all terrorists! Hamas is hiding in apartment blocks so it’s a legitimate military target for Israeli drones!111!!!! /s
Aight my grandpa was „Born and raised“ in Ostpreußen, todays Kaliningrad, I’ll be waiting for that to become Germany again if all it takes to be one’s land is to be „Born and raised there“… your whole logic on this thread is flawed, do yourself a favor and stop arguing
Do you just pretend the millions of terrorized Palestinians don’t exist?
Hello![A new video](https://www.instagram.com/reel/CxCLdt8KJ24/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==) of Ahmad Manasra, a 21-year-old Palestinian man who was imprisoned at 13 for a stabbing that he was proven (in Israeli court) to have not participated in, has been publicized. He has spent so much time in solitary confinement in Israeli prison that he has been diagnosed with schizophrenia, depression, and exhibits suicidal behavior.Just last week, Israeli soldiers broke into a Palestinian home and [forced the women to strip naked](https://www.btselem.org/routine_founded_on_violence/20230905_soldiers_enter_homes_of_extended_ajlouni_family_with_dogs_and_female_soldiers_strip_search_women), under the threat of police dogs, while their children watched. The soldiers left after destroying furniture, handcuffing and blindfolding some of the family members, and stealing money from the home.In 2020, [a Palestinian man with autism was shot while hiding from Israeli soldiers.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killing_of_Eyad_al-Hallaq) His murderer was acquitted in court this July under the guise of "self defense."I hope this helps!
Born and raised there, so yes.
Where did I say their behavior was okay?
They need to do that at home
Not really.
While these kids behavior is unacceptable and the adults should be ashamed for allowing them to behave this way, the ladies being harassed were out there proselytizing. We all know how annoying street preachers are?
Ima go there so I can finally figure out how many kids I could beat up
I had no idea that this sub had become so full of people that hate Jewish people. Surprised people aren’t JQ’ing.
The whole race? Fucking Nazi
Another classic mind control via religion 🔥🔥🔥🔥
That house didn’t deserve that. All alone doing nothing..
Yall? how homey of you. Bad behavior, whether by proselytizers or children, is bad behavior.
Better yet, walk up to the adults just watching (kid's parents?) and smack them.
I 100% agree. It would be bad. Would it justify such action? I believe not.Although I don't think it's their fault for wanting to preach their religion.
Both parties are equally "religiousist" as you call it.Coming into a religious neighborhood and loudly preaching another religion is in fact, offensive, and they are completely at fault.If a Jew entered a religious Christian town and started preaching loudly how Jesus is a false prophet and they should all convert, that would also be bad.
Oh, my bad. Forgot it's not the 2020s and that religiounism (for lack of a better term) is still the norm.Imagine if the religions were reversed.
As a Jew myself I find this behaviour disgusting!But in response to your comment… when was the last time you saw a Jew commit an act of terrorism… especially an Orthodox Jew, which these children clearly are… the worst thing they are capable of is embezzlement 🙄Edit: i didn’t think it needed explaining… but…The behaviour I found/find disgusting is the behaviour shown in the footage… not the racism shown in the comment I replied to… however ALL racism is disgusting and if you don’t agree with that statement YOU ARE PART OF THE PROBLEM!I swear I’m only getting hate because I stated that I’m Jewish… I was agreeing that the behaviour of those boys was awful but ffs throwing racism at racism isn’t gonna solve anything! “#bethechange” and all that bsALSO… when was the last time you saw a Jew strap on an s-vest..? Just saying
I think it's like the more fresher version of the Old Testament 🤔
Go talk to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ!
Thank god most of the pics you see are of the impact zones from the planes, or looking up. Years ago I happened upon a couple pics looking down at the plaza before the towers fell and I can’t scrub the images from my mind
Once you find out what those Christians were doing before this video was made you may change your opinion…You guys really need to do some research into Sarah (the black shirt lady) and how she constantly harasses Jews and Muslims in Israel and attempts to convert them. In this video she walks into a holy Jewish site during a holy period and tells these ultra Orthodox Jews to pray to Jesus. And what does she want? She wants to bring the rapture so all the Jews and Muslims go to Hell and she can be delivered to Heaven.
this is pathetic
I understood what you said.I have seen this video more than once, and this explanation that's always brought up, seem to a lot like a good justification for what I am seeing?I don't get it. Still don't get it. I feel like if you disengaged she wouldn't go after you? Is she yelling? Is she sitting on a table plucking people with a camera and asking them to "change my mind"?None of those seem like a justification for what I am seeing those children do still? Looks like the Rabbi is engaged in a friendly exchange?Someone please explain.
Well, to be fair, it does like this happened on "Kid a Child in the Face Day" in Jerusalem.
I also don't have a link however, i did notice she has a mic on which made me think she might be a missionary
Nice to post a video with missing context.They weren't just Christians, they were specifically "Messianic Jews", aka Protestant Christians who appropriate Jewish culture and pretend to be Jews.They came into a religious Jewish neighborhood and started preaching Jesus to the locals, a thing which very obviously offended them.No, I don't feel any sympathy for them. Play stupid games win stupid prizes.And yall need to calm down with the Gobbles shit you're on.
No link, but i live in Jerusalem and know about this phenomenon. These people also hold conferences together with messianic jews in a shopping mall in midtown, were they are also protested by religious jews who don't want christians attempting to convert them.
You know,  the Jewish people in Jerusalem became nazis so gradually I barely noticed
Like lead poisoning? Or some other metal illness?
This is an EXTREMELY toured area. Just in the borders of the Jewish quarters of the old city, couple minutes walk past the western wall. It's full of tourists, all the time, basically 24/7. It's NEVER okay to attack or assault anyone, especially not people visiting your country, and even more so not because of their religion. Those kids are entirely in the wrong. I would have intervened.
Link to that claim, please.
She's a missionaire who is a part of organizations that harasses jews and want them to convert, and she preaches on sabbath.Imagine seeing someone come to a country, disrupt religious people's practices to preach her religion, and think SHE'S the victim when they reply in anger.F her.
That little kid at the end makes me so, so sad. Obvious he just wants to emulate his peers but feels conflicted
So much hate
My world.
Aw man. Left, right, goodnight's for all of them.
Foul people
Hitting children is lazy parenting. If you hit your kids just give them away to an adoption center. They deserve better than you.
„their land“
same vibes as „If she didn’t want to get raped she shouldn’t have worn tight leggings“
This is how this shit keeps happening.   "I had this done to me when I was young so it's ok to do to others"  Fuck you, hitting children is NEVER ok
Cults of any type are dangerous.
How can she slap?!?!
Nazionists
I was unfamiliar with the term "ethnostate" and its loophole. Thank you for teaching me
Well, when you make an ethnostate (israel) in response to the creation of an ethnostate (nazi germany), you still have net one ethnostate. And it will act accordingly, like all ethnostates do.
"all I want for Christmas is you"
&lt;uno\_reverse.gif&gt;
cry about it ;\_;
Jerusalem should be so proud of its young men.  A shining example of their faith for all to see.
I didn’t say it did. But it wasn’t a surprise that it happened. If she didn’t want stung, she shouldn’t have shaken the hornets’ nest.
I would say facilitates instead of allows. I already said the children’s behavior isn’t right, but their behavior is predictable. That specific community is not known for their tolerance.
Does still not warrant violence or harassment
Ok. Assumed disrespect allows physical abuse.Shit. That's most wars.
Her Sabbath is Sunday because she is Christian. She is preaching Christianity to ultra conservative Jews on their holy day and on their land. That’s incredibly disrespectful for any “tourist” to do.
Because her behavior is directly responsible for their response to her behavior.
Just yuk behaviour
Read the fucking article. It's No-Fee.
Of course they didn't. This is reddit.
Disgusting
Where have I read about this exact same thing happening before but I can’t for some reason put my finger on it.
Why not? It's her Sabbath, too. If you don't like your views being questioned, don't shout them so fucking loud.
I don't care for either side of the argument, but this is the definition of indoctrination.
Go for it, Reddit been shitting on plenty races &amp; religions lately.
Why not? Why blame the victim?
r/angryupvote
What a load of shite. You absolutely can reason with a seven year old.Source; I'm a single parent to my son, who is six. I have never hit him and do indeed reason with him, multiple times a day, every day.
Did you ever have to pick a switch as a kid? After the first time, the simple act of picking a switch is enough to alter behaviors...
Hitting your children is bullsh@t. Disciplining children alters behavior. It involves explaining the wrong action, punishment, and resolve. Try reason with a seven year old. They are not mentally capable of that level of reason. That is a long learned ability. Just like sharing isn't inherent. It's learned. It takes discipline association and the groundwork of reason to teach them.
 Children’s behavior isn’t right, but the lady should not have been proselytizing in an ultra-Orthodox area on the Sabbath.
Just to be clear, are you suggesting that people hit children to teach them not to hit people?
Looks like unattended kids being little sh@theads. Name a location, race, or religion. Same sh@t different location. The little kids are trying to impress the older kids. It just keeps escalating from there. A parent and a stick corrects a whole lot of this behavior. Quickly
I want my tax dollars back. Now...
I'd like to comment on this but it normally results in a ban.
They probably weren’t even family members.
I define shitty people by how they execute LGBTQ people and parade their corpses through the streets to mock and throw rocks at. I think the shittiness is deserved. Not for all of course, that's terrible and undeserving, but I don't need to stipulate that nuance since it's not stipulated for the other side, but the nuance is still lost.
Killing children and innocent civilians will never be fighting for freedom. Go fuck yourself. Put this mf on a watchlist
Ewww that's a new one to me
This is why I try to only change my kid in the car. It's a hatch back and I have a spot set up for bum changes. Public bathrooms are horror shows at times.
Is home boy drunk? Also the golf cart take down had me howling.
Sounds like shit hit the fan....
There's a fine line between a fetish and a metal illness
Really?
Possibly. Interesting stuff
Now, now - don't fet shame! It's 2023 !
It's so strange to me when the post *is* an article that's readable and no one reads it.
The staff did offer to help her. They offered to carry her. Not saying that's a good solution, but they did offer. Did you not read the article?
I don't know. I heard it from a 9-11 fire fighter at a memorial yesterday. When I looked it up, somewhere it said GERD. It could be that it wounded their esophagus?
its like another holocaust
you say terrorism, I say freedom fighter. fuck Israel

There is an excellent book by Blake Morrison called As If - which offers an interesting perspective on the killing and the killers themselves.
I remember this story. Super fucked up.
I think you'd be changing your smug opinion pretty fast if something like this happened to your child.You and every other bleeding heart out there spew the same rehabilitation horseshit, that is, until it happens to your family. Then you'd be calling for the death penalty too.
https://youtu.be/5H-NctipBvg?si=nV-i4IGfF3v4mPklGeorge had some ideas
Here y'are https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/james-bulger-murder-25-year-anniversary-killing-shook-britain-a8108451.html
There was another case in northern England in 2009 involving 10 and 11 year olds that was very similar in terms of unbelievable levels of sadistic cruelty.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edlington_attacks
She knows. Denise has done a lot of interviews over the years and written a book.
Try not to murder a toddler challenge: IMPOSSIBLE
Ditto. I was 12 yo at the time when it all happened &amp; it has always been firmly embedded within my memory. What really got to me many years later was discovering the further actions that had been carried out against the defenceless lad &amp; the description of the scene of the crime. The media coverage on this part was pretty reserved, though totally understandable &amp; probably for the best for most people.
I think Thompson's coldness was from the abuse he faced. I was a "cold" child and still am.Venables just sounds manipulative, making it sound like Thompson was some violent bully that had forced him to do it. This is despite the fact that that Venables was known to be very violent before even met Thompson (Thompson lacked a violent history).
I guess we just have a difference in opinion. I would prefer a ten year old -- even a ten year old murderer -- be given the chance to prove themselves rehabilitated if possible, rather than ass raped in prison by some guy with HIV. And it might not be possible, in which case the person should indeed stay in prison for life.
5 stars, no notes.
I remember hearing about this when it happened and I was literally sick to my stomach, imagining the horror that little baby went through and thinking of how many times he must have called out for his mum. And then I had a son just a couple of years after they were released and again it brought it all back up to the surface because all I could picture was my own child having to go through that and thinking how horrid it was 😣.  I want to believe because of the age they were, they deserve a second chance. But, if you let them out and give them a new identity and give them a one shot and they fuck it up, that's it to me. To me they should go back to jail for life and that should be the end of it. But unfortunately that's not how it works. I'm also not sure if I was James's mother how I would have felt with them getting parole. I'm sure my outlook on it would have been much much different. And how that woman was able to pick up and carry on is just beyond me 💔. I don't know that I could have done the same. Very strong woman!
“although both boys deny this”.I saw video of one of the killers telling his mum “I didn’t kill the baby”.Denials are easy to say. He said it with such conviction I think he even believed it.
He's also returned to Merseyside (neither are allowed to return to the Merseyside area)Honestly, Venables should not get parole.
Are you ten years old? If so, then yes, I think you deserve at least a chance of rehabilitation. Maybe you'll be given that chance and fail, in which case, yes, you should be in prison forever. But it is my opinion that a ten year old should at least be given years of intensive evaluation and mental health treatment and given the chance to prove themselves rehabilitated.
Can anyone suggest an article about this that isn't horribly written? The Unfortunate History piece OP posted reads like an eighth grade book report.
The VAST majority of animals do not torture others this way.
Easy to say when it's not your child.
What a terrible day to be able to read: pedophile manual?!?!?! WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK?
When the crimes are this brutal, I believe you can justify locking these boys up for life just in the interest of public safety. Sure they may not have been developed human beings, but this is so abnormally anti social so as to make me believe they have horrible psychiatric disorders that can probably never be fixed. You have to be completely broken to do this, and if you're completely broken we need to all be safe from you.
And then being in detention and constantly monitored and appraised over the years probably helped him learn a lot more about how to work the system.
This happened where I lived, I was about 11 and I remember my mum took me to see the flowers that people were laying for James on the railway and I’ll never forget how many people and flowers were there. It really affected the whole city and still does.
Genuine question but, who would do the torturing in that case? I certainly couldn't torture someone, let alone a child, no matter what they did. So, who and what kind of person would be employed to be a government endorses torturer?
I would put my money on the latter. He was ten years old. To me, that spells sociopath
I've mentioned this on another comment, but my understanding is that the police considered Thompson to be the ringleader and Venables to be the one who was led. Knowing what we know now makes you wonder just how manipulative Venables was at such a young age.
The thing with Venables that always gets me is that when they were arrested the police saw Venables as the more "innocent" of the two who was led by Thompson. I always wonder if this was true and Venables got fucked up while he was in detention or if, evem at 10, he knew how to maniplate people. I guess we'll never really know. Thompson is the only one (other than Venables) who knows what happened and even if he was going to talk about it he's hardly a reliable narrator
What is the link, the cctv video?
remember when computer games came in box's and there was a small booklet with instructions on how to play the game. its like that but for diddeling kids.

There should be a law against releasing films about murder victims without the consent of the family.Like Kim Wall (a Swedish journalist who was murdered). Her family worked with a television company to create a documentary series as a tribute to the Investigators and other people who worked on the case. They had a huge input on everything.
.
Second biggest I reckon. Harold Shipman is probably the worst.
Rip
I wonder if she knows that. It's not her fault at all, but man the guilt you would have knowing if you had just turned your head the other way.
That's very true, I do know they told one witness they had found him injured and she directed them to a local police station, she said she regrets it to this day but in her position a lot of people would act similarly
Thank you for that I'll correct my comment now
These 2 need the Dexter treatment. Not the cartoon one.
No one would travel to avenge their family?
Well I’m not discarding your opinion anyway, it’s okay to disagree civilly
Wait, so let me get this straight. You have two groups of people fighting in the street about a government that isn't even the government of the country they are in? Why the fuck don't they go back to the country that actually has the government they are fighting about? If the dudes in red are for that countries government why the hell aren't they there?
They don’t really have free speech in the UK
Quite interested to hear more about this speech.
I remember this being in the papers and all over the news at the time.I was 10 and it still turns my stomach to this day.Sickening, makes you wonder what possessed them to do this.
How evil can one be😔😪. People like that should be burned alive at the stake
How would you give these two demons new identities and allow to walk the streets? Who cares if they themselves were kids? What they did was so evil, they should have been locked up and the key thrown away until the day they die. Each day living with the grief and suffering they’ve caused to such a defenceless and young life.
Even now I can’t look at this without feeling sick. It’s much worse now being a parent too
The butcher's he was stood outside of in The Strand when he was taken absolutely stank to high heaven; I always used to wait out there when mum went in to buy Ulster fry/ribs. I was in primary school when this happened and was never allowed to wait outside again. My parents were far more relaxed about me going into town than to the Strand when I got to teenage years.All these years later it still absolutely horrifies my parents whenever it's mentioned. I'm sure every family in Bootle/Litherland had an equivalent story like above, but it always felt so close that now as a parent myself I am overcautious in a far more rural environment.The poor, poor little lad. Sickening to read the full grim details.
Impossible to know the truth really. I'm sure they both egged each other on and were equally culpable
Or it was true and one got better in prison and the other got worse
I watched a documentary on this case and I was kind of sickened by the fact that they were convicted but were there from they have I'm going to say a rule or whatever that when children are locked away and then they're released and they have been released they change their names and they relocate them so no one can ever know what they've done I think that's terrible
&gt; Both should be smoked out and be introduced to tortures only written about.So much as _trying_ to do so would subject you to considerably harsher punishment than what these _fine_ members of society are themselves experiencing.
Venables was arrested again for possession of cp, Thompson stayed out of trouble and has a new identity.
&gt; I would think something like that could be covered under free speech.Which unfortunately does not exist in the United Kingdom.And even in cases where such documents aren't, _alone_, illegal to own, they can end up being used against you in court if you get arrested and charged with literally any other crime.
I was once reading the Wikipedia page of this tragedy, I actually had to stop reading cause I felt sick, full of hatred and sadness… I still haven’t revisited the Wikipedia page.
At the time though the police thought it was the other way around, Venables seemed remorseful whereas Thompson was very cold.
This case had traumatized me since I was young, I had nightmares. It was so unsettling how young the monsters were.
&gt; And it is a crime having such a manual.This part is actually fascinating. As disgusting as it is, I would think something like that could be covered under free speech.
The video I sent is from Hebron, happened just a day ago.What you sent in the link is Gaza, in May.You're just throwing stuff all over the place.Deal with the video and the incident.
This broke my heart
Too many mistakes in the legal system to make this a viable option.
It's what came before the paedophile automatic.
You're saying the government should have tortured and killed ten year old boys?Thank god you're not a lawmaker
The murderers in this case were also children, the people you're saying you want to protect.Just throwing that out there
sickens me that the courts changed their names and they're walking free right now
I remember hearing that at the time everyone thought Thompson was the ringleader and Venables the one playing along, turns out it was the opposite.
Quite a lot a area between 6 months and life, it's a bit of a strawman argument to say it like that.
Now I'm hoping it was Creed or Nickleback, nothing like people getting out of sorts over butt rock
She probably didn’t like the music they were playing at the police station and started shit again.
I hope those two fuckers die by the most horrible death imaginable.If I could, I'd personally make them realise in how much pain Bulger was by a straightforward demonstration, but I'd also add a power drill and a saw. Then we'd see how much fun they're having when they're the ones on the torturing chair
She was locked up, released &amp; locked up again before she left the police station, wow!
+2
Welp we disagree then, the point of the justice system is to rehabilitate and return people to society. Sometimes that's not possible and so it makes sense to lock someone up forever. What about the second 10 year old who was also released and never reoffended. Should he be rotting jail for something he did while he was 10 and was very possibly convinced to do by the second kid who did reoffend? Life sentences should be a matter of last resort used against only the worst of the worst.
This broke me just now, enough reddit for today. Terrible
Because the alternative is locking everyone away forever with no shot of redemption.
Poor dude, he didn't want the answer *tsk* *tsk*
No more internet for today.
That is, if not thee, one of the most fucked up things I have read, wayyy more than lord of the flies shit, just straight up demons acting out their will.
Awful fact: Venables and Thompson were both housed together opposite a school for a brief time on release
Well that just summed it up for me. I'm with you!
This video has haunted me for years. I decided not to have kids due to my anxiety. When my wife got pregnant I suffered such anxiety. Yet those two killers are constantly in and out of prison, living under assumed identity et one has been caught with child porn. I just have nothing but hatred for those two. Poor Jamie, his face haunts me so much.Last year I read a book which was by an lawyer in that case. It did nothing to quell my anger
This image breaks my heart…
This story has always haunted me. That poor baby.
Me being rehabilitated after I brutally murder a 2 year old because I didn't know better 😊
Orrrr he’s trying it as a marketing tactic to bring people in.
How can a 10 year old kid be this fucked up
Man I get feeling that but both were 10 years old. One has shown to be a repeat offender so yeah they need to stop letting him out.The other has not repeat offended. 10 years old is a child and considering they have the same mental capacity as an adult is a mistake. Prison as a punishment system instead of rehabilitation system needs to stop. I know the emotions on a case like this are intense but a 10 year should get the chance at rehabilitation.One of them clearly has tried to do better. The other should not get another chance and needs to be locked up. He clearly can't operate normally in society without being a predator.
Judicial system at its finest. Clearly all traits of a psychopath, yet released to the public. Both should be smoked out and be introduced to tortures only written about.
Wait so ten year olds killed a baby ? Why ? What’s their explanation and they didn’t face any consequences
They made a movie loosely based about this in Poland called Playground. Man it's a hard watch.
Wow, he looks exactly what I thought he would look like.
That Parole Board POS should go to jail
I don't completely agree with that. Have you watched the documentary "Child of Rage"? Unrelated to this case, and while she never killed anyone she did torture her baby brother, tortured and killed the family pets and attempted to murder her parents and brother many times. Despite that, with therapy she grew up to be a totally normal, remorseful person.
That poor baby.  The details I've read about what they did to him sexually regularly haunt me when I am reminded of this case.  Dear sweet little boy..I am so sorry you fell prey to those evil creatures.
What I read
You know shit has crossed the line when…
Yeah, he is definitely on a list now!
Yeah, I think you’re right.
I've heard about them a year ago via a German podcast.It was Saud that the mother had to chose which way to run to search for her boy. She took the wrong decision. If she hadn't it's said that she probably could've catched them before they left the mall...These mofos, no matter how young, should've been kept secured awa, from society from day one. I'm calling psychiatry sentence for a lifetime.Some say you can't be born evil,... Then I'd really don't want to know how they became this way
They lied and said he was their brother, not a hard claim to believe in the moment.
Please, don't call him Jamie. Same goes for the OP. James' mother dislikes it, because it's not his name.
Venebles gets about th UK. He's been exposed several times and is quickly relocated when it happens
Wow, that's just... heartbreaking.
It’s James by the way. His mother was upset about the government calling her son Jamie [Here](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/uk-world-news/james-bulgers-mum-fury-government-12026677)
This is one fugged up world we live in.
I live in the US and remember this horrible crime.  That innocent child and not so innocent child murderers.  You've got to have mental issues to commit such atrocities.
r/Beetlejuicing
Most likely paedo points manual made by this guy https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14538632.photographer-compiled-paedophiles-manual-handed-22-life-sentences/
Clearly Venables was the ring leader, the sick fuck should rot in prison (they both should)
These ‘guides’ generally contain instructive content on how to groom and lure a child into being sexually exploited and abused. They also provide advice on how to evade capture by law enforcement agencies. They can be highly detailed and fairly lengthy documents.There's nothing wrong with being informed about crime. And it is a crime having such a manual.
Absolutely it did. Releasing them later however, turned out to be a mistake for one of them.
I know what you mean, but by saying that you're downplaying their responsibility imo. Same direction as the 'they had no other choice, it was their instinct'
The amount of crimes that have gone unpunished because of "boys being boys" is infuriating.
Why did they do it? They were only 10 years old… what happened to them that made them be able to do such things at that young age?
Fucking awful. Poor baby. Always disturbed me how they were allowed to walk free after doing this.
Even I wouldn't ask that question.
This story is branded in my soul. It haunts me like a ghost. I’ve never been so goddamn bothered by anything else. FYI, it was James Bulger. The London Press wanted to evoke maximum sympathy from readers, as if the cold-blooded murder of a 2-year-old boy wasn’t enough.
The government did the right thing.It's... Difficult to have to put aside the horror and disgust and the strong emotions that the crime arouses in people. It's not an easy task, and the crime was so, *so* disgusting. And that picture of little Jamie that was on the news all the time back then, he was such a cute kid. It was appalling. All of it was just awful But the law can't be overly emotional; the quality of mercy and all that; and we can't just sink into violence and depravity to answer violence and depravity. We must force ourselves to do better in order to be better. And that often means having to curb our nastier impulses, take a deep breath, and insist on reason and restraint. Which can be really hard, especially in situations like the Jamie Bulger case. Our ability to do this is one of the huge differences between us and feral animals.There were other child killers before, though - Mary Bell, for instance.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Bell
I personally believe that it was mainly Venables who did this and Thompson went along with it, he should be locked up still rightfully so and as he’s not I’d hope he is highly monitored. If you listen to the recordings a lot of the time Thompson goes on about how “he’s getting the blame.” I think it was Venables with the ideas and Thompson just being the little shit he was agreed not thinking it’d go so far. Venables is a waste of air and should be given what he deserves in prison, if he gets out again the justice system has failed our kids.
Makes him sound young, I don’t think you could pull on the broken heart strings harder but calling him Jamie reminds you he was just a baby.
I can’t get my head around how two 10yr CHILDREN have it in them to do acts so horrific they’d put most experienced torturers to shame. How have they got mental capacity or the knowledge to do those things?
I have another photo saved to my phone. This is definitely him.
Me neither. I wouldn’t give the state power to execute an adult either, let alone a child.
Thompson killed a 2 year old child. No matter if he reoffends or not, it doesn’t alter how evil he is
Don’t know where you got foreskin from but yeah
It was never confirmed, there is evidence that comes to that conclusion though. Wouldn’t be a surprise with Venables list of reoffences
I was 9 when it happened and I remember it vividly being everywhere. Even as kids we sobbed, my friends and I all had siblings around James’ age and it just hit so hard.
They inserted batteries into his for skin and anus. Smashed his body with rocks. And then a train cut him in half. Brutal, so brutal
Following 👀
Think hard, do you really want that question answered. I don't.
I’ve lived in liverpool most of my life but was born a good few years after it happened. Our whole lives we grew up knowing what happened to James, it was something that a ton of scousers talked about for years and even now sometimes. I’ve been to the strand several times and even to where he was taken, it’s heartbreaking. I truly think Venables was the evil one of the two and Thompson just went along with it, that doesn’t excuse him at all but Venables shouldn’t be given another chance at freedom
Same my friend, I read it too  and as a father of a ten year old boy myself I couldn't not think to myself  'what if that was my son' . It actually made me break down reading's what they done to James, absolutely  heartbreaking  and my thoughts are always  with that poor little boy and his family...R.I.P James.
People think with their balls more than their brain, typically. I for one am not relaxed about giving the state the power to execute ten year olds.
Yeah see, I can understand one new identity, but if he gets drunk and flaps his mouth then he should be on his own. We've paid enough for that gobshite.
Agree for re-offenders, Venables in this case since he was reconvicted TWICE in his adult life for pedophilia. People like that will never change and it's a waste of resources keeping them alive.I believe in second chances, and *only* second chances. After that, I'm all for the death penalty (at least in regards to murders and sex crimes) Thankfully it sounds like Thompson managed to turn his life around and I would hope feels remorse.
What are people's thoughts on Thompson? The sentences were far far too lenient but he hasn't gone on to reoffend so may have "rehabilitated". Venables can die, he's too far gone
There is a short film called “Detainment” (2018) about the entire incident. They took all the statements by Venables and Thompson from the investigation and made it into a 30 min drama that depicts how they took Bulger and did what they did. They don’t show much, but hearing the statements and seeing the perspective of the parents is truly disturbing and nightmarish. It’s a very well made short with some amazing acting.
They were arrested in their pyjamas.I was 12ish when this happened. That case is still so crazy.One is back in jail, iirc, for being a kiddie fiddler. Venables, I think.
This one has always haunted me
The amount of passers-by who saw James with his killers crying and injured but assumed it was just boys being boys is infuriating.
Sorry I can’t read that information. Sickening. I remember when I first saw it on the news.
He’s just not worth that.  I say, after getting the second new identity, tell him that if he screws up mow, he’s on his own
Holy shit, TIL. Turns out they ended up with exactly the same treatment.
Some societies. Luckily not ours, as capital punishment was abolished. Not a chance anyone would win advocating the murder of two ten year-olds.
Sadly, not totally unprecedented:Mary Bellhttps://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Bell
Doubt it if the public finds out who he is he’ll 100% get lynched by an angry mob the UK hasn’t forgotten what he did
One of the Oscar Nominated Short films in 2018 was about this. They made the film against the wishes of the family and it's just grotesque. I genuinely disliked all of the shorts that year but this was beyond the pale. Horrible story that should never be told again.
One note - his parents always called him James. The name Jamie was given to him by the media.
Even more teriffying is hearing the tapes of the boys while they were being questioned by police. The innocence of their young voices. And then when they finally confess, its horiffic.This happened an hour away from where I live but I was too young at the time to understand at the time  just how bad this was. I can't really read about it now but I listened to a crime podcast that included James' story and I had to turn it off and walk away i have 3 boys and i am in awe that little J's mother is still standing and fighting for a change of law. She amazes me with her strength after losing her boy this way..Just putting it out there, he was never Jamie Bulger he was James Bulger. The media did the Jamie thing, his mother and his family only ever called him James.Breaks my heart. Venables **does not get to go free** after reoffending.
I’m not surprised - Reddit tends to be very…passionate about jailing criminals. These are children. Not just technically like a 17 year-old, but actual children. They should be in secure settings for life, for sure.
It's one of the most famous cases in Britain and it's still well known 30 years later.
Amen to that, nobody in the UK downplays this, what a load of shite.It's etched on the public's consciousness - doubt anyone in the UK doesn't know who James Bulger or those two animals are.
I wonder what happened to the Dnepropetrovsk maniacs. if you were 10 when you committed a horrible act, I believe you can change and recover from your past self.if you were in your early 20s, like those Ukrainians? I don't think so.
idk why you're being downvoted for saying we shouldn't kill children. yes they should absolutely still be in jail but killed? no
Like those fucks can never grow into well-functioning adults.  They’re sociopath animals, and should be lock up indefinitely.
Any particular talking points that stood out?
I made the mistake of reading an in-depth story about this. The last hours of that poor little boy's life were heartbreaking.
Sometimes it feels like humanity was born right on the edge of what it means to be human or animal. And some people are just unlucky and are born below the line.
The most brutal thing - James' mother looked left to see where he went. If she'd looked to her right straight away, she would have seen him.28 people saw the boys leading James away and two stopped them because he was crying.They told them he was their little brother.
He was also sodomised with sticks and rocks for hours by them until they crushed his head with a rock and left him on the train tracks to die.
These children are free to repeat this
I think I heard a few of these stories where their chair doesn’t make it to the airport that they land at 💀
2nd worst to standing directly in front of them.
One if them intentionally disclosed his real identity after being granted a new one TWICE. They still awarded him a new one, and then he reoffended.
They need them, they’d be hunted down otherwise
You mustn’t be from the UK trust me this was not downplayed or buried
They don’t deserve to ever see the light of day again! I don’t care what fucking age they are!
This was the biggest crime of the decade in the UK idk how you could consider it buried. It's still discussed in media, news, criminology classes. It was and still is enormous.
My freshman year for forensics I did a whole informative speech on this whole case
Ugh, this is a prime example of "I wish I'd never clicked on this link". Utterly heartbreaking and vile.
The story behind this is tragic. It breaks my heart whenever it is brought up. As a parent, this is hard to live with knowing.

I hope Venables rots in prison
Jesus Christ. The was horrific to read
Yeah, shocking stuff. That is the whole big deal about this case, nothing like this had ever happened before. It's impossible to know what's the right thing to do.
https://twitter.com/victoriousbear/status/933871701485596672?t=-TeD_18nYl8Bg6SkCPsdvQ&amp;s=19 thats the photo I know of
It was a drive by fruiting.
There are no photos of him online, no one knows where or who he is at the present.
Yep. Even their parents were moved to different parts of the country and given new identities due to death threats.
They were both 10, and would make the state just as bad as them.
They were 10, it sparked heated debate about how they should be treated since it was totally unprecedented.
Not quite - one them is back in prison and will probably stay there.
Venables is back in prison. Thompson was released.
I've never forgotten James. Now I have my own little boy, I was in a shopping centre feeling relaxed at how safe it was being enclosed and not packed. Then I remembered what happened to James.
&gt;under protection with new identities.   Wow.  Just wow.
Venables often drinks too much, blows his cover and needs to be relocated at the tax payer's expense. There are fairly recent photos of him online.
Both boys were due to be held indefinitly, but in 2001 a parole board decided to release them on a lifelong licence with new identities at age 18.Venables was imprisoned again in 2010 for breaching the terms of his licence. He was released in 2013. In 2017 was arrested for having child sexual abuse photos on his computer. He pleasded guilty to having a paedophile manual during his trial in 2018 and has been imprisoned ever since. In 2020 he was denied parole. Just over a week ago he was reportadly (although unconfirmed) being granted a new parole hearing and could be released within the coming weeks.Thompson hasn't re-offended since his initial release in 2001.
Pure evil.
an eye for an eye makes the world a fairer place
People who commit crimes as horrible as that honestly should be tortured to death
Man seriously. I hope they get into the worst situations imaginable
This happened in 1993. Absolutely everyone who was living in and around the UK at that time remembers this vividly, it's very much a part of the public consciousness. Everyone knows the names of the two killers. You'll still see occasional articles speculating about where the two murderers are, because they're under protection with new identities.It's far from downplayed or buried, but it did happened 30 years ago
I’m not sure whether their anonymity will be lifted or not, but I sure as fuck hope it will.
Excellent!
Those two are free and living under different names now, if I remember correctly.
I feel like the world has always been mad- mobile phones are just giving us a much clearer picture of the scale…
Yeah it is. He’s fine, it’s benign and he gets checkups each year to make sure it’s not growing.
Honestly it just hurts the soul that this kind of thing is super downplayed and buried
People were still going about their business like this is normal?
I think everyone in the country has their story about ways that day traumatized them. I have my own, among other things it was my oldest son’s 19th birthday and he had just started college halfway across the country. But nothing compares to the people who were there, those who survived and those who didn’t. I can’t even imagine.
That's my understanding, that they were not recovered prior to that, due to the unsurvivable nature of their injuries. They could have been hit by debris that bounced away, or they could have been early fallers (it has been acknowledged that people may have been falling before anyone realized they were falling....).
So these people ended up in the plaza when the plane hit? I have never heard this story and didn’t know there were people that had fallen all the way down. We’re they lost in the collapse? I would assume they didn’t have time to remove them otherwise he would know who the woman was?
If it's free, I'll take two please.
You'd think he'd get lung cancer. Human body is weird, man.I hope your Dad is OK

How did she get on the plane?.
Humanity has become so heartless.
Thank you for reminding us of the sacrifices so many public servants, volunteers and citizens made after that tragic eventSo many have perished, or continue to suffer, from the hazards, exposures or traumas they were put through.

Since I had the sound off and didn't read the title I thought he was cooking something.![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sweat)
And maybe you're just making stupid assumptions?1. According to the article (Palestinian media) he took a revenge on Palestinian Police after one of his relatives got arrested by them.2. You don't know this person and if his children died.3. Israeli Air Force's jets don't attack in Hebron, you'll have to open a map and do some reading before you spread your bullshit. Have a nice day :)
From Hamas terrorists, yeah.
His children were probably killed by Israeli fighter jets blowing up and collapsing buildings on whole family. Maybe.

My dad was in the FBI, he recovered bodies in the Pentagon. He actually got prostate cancer from the fumes and debris he inhaled for three days + straight.
Right! It’s like this is exactly what fighting to keep the land your family has farmed and lived and died in for centuries gets you! Those damn Palestinians, and their “things”.
Yeah, that would be a terrible thing to know that your mother suffered so much!  But she probably already had to accept that she died violently in some way.  Maybe it would be good, in some way, to know that she was thinking about her in her last moments.  Idk.  So tragic!
Preeeeaaach
I have always wondered about her - who was she? Did her daughter ever know that she was asking for her? In many ways, I hope her daughter has never been identified - it would be a blow to the gut to know her mom was lucid enough to ask for her, while in such a dire state and situation. I know a few people have tried to determine the injured woman's identity, but I hope they are never able to do so.
You’d think the staff or other passengers would of offered to assist her.

No.According to Palestinian Maan news agency, the assailant wanted to take a revenge after Palestinian police arrested several people:https://www.maannews.net/news/2100518.html
Correct, he shot towards Palestinian police station as appears in this article in Arabic from Palestinian  Maan news agency (video is in there too):https://www.maannews.net/news/2100518.html
The one angle where you can't be seen? I get your point though.
Or that one dude, just having a conversation on his phone walking behind the shooter.
Is that a fucking FAMAS?
Uh... THAT's a police station?
What a horrific day😪
This is very similar to combat triage. But that woman's words are going to stick with me for a while. I have never heard this telling of this incident and impact in the plaza.
Local police = [Palestinian authority ](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palestinian_Civil_Police_Force). I think but could be wrong, can't find any articles ab the shooting
Al jazeera 😆
I just watched a video of his account, and I don't know which is more terrifying, having to witness a hopelessly mangled person pleading for help or falling 90+ stories and surviving.

Pretty sure he’s shooting at other Palestinians, in zone A general policing is left to the local government.

Brave to record. Guessing it ends with them getting shot. Probably in retaliation for the 16 year old who got killed in the camps the day before. https://imemc.org/article/israeli-soldiers-shoot-kill-a-palestinian-child-near-hebron/
Maybe don’t stand and record behind the dude that’s gonna have a shit ton of bullets coming at him
Ah yes let me stand right behind this gentleman
Good thinking, stand behind the guy foreign an automatic rifle at Israel police (who are not known for their restraint or attempts to avoid civilian casualties.)
I see this all the time in Palestinian combat footage. The IDF and some PLJ members will be trading shots and the locals just… form a solid spectator wall around the action. Its like theyre trying to position themselves optimally to catch strays.
OMG that's so crazy, I didn't realize it's the 10th of September already
Maybe don’t stand behind him
This is why Palestinians can’t have nice things.
If the cops had shot back, the headlines of *some* papers would be "Israeli police officers open fire on Palestinian fruit stand."
Shooting at the actual Palestinian government forces is not based

Bro shut the absolute fuck up “we didn’t consider if he had a gun.. so he should be shot just in case” 🤓 y’all try so hard to validate murder over nothing
&gt;some old nut job[he wasn't old](https://www.mystateline.com/news/weird/wanted-illinois-man-seen-terrorizing-town-arrested-after-being-ran-over-by-golf-cart/)
This is basically a gang war
And how come nobody’s even considered the fact that the crazy guy very well could also have a fucking gun? And let’s not forget that 95% of time when some psychopath is breaking somebody’s window it’s because they want to go in there and hurt whoever is on the other side. IMO I wouldn’t even go near that guy without a weapon at the risk of him turning around and killing me with a gun or a rock or whatever the hell he has, and I’m surely not gonna give him a chance to enter my home. Some ppl on the internet are so brain-rotted to the point they think it’s a good idea to just walk up to an insane person and try to incapacitate them with their bare hands and unfortunately that’s where natural selection will take effect.
Again, are you the home owner? If this was my house, one of my kids would usually be by similar window as they like to watch the cats hang out in the garden and chase bugs. What stopping this guy from taking another rock and trying to throw it directly at someone that he sees? The danger section has been established long time ago, ain’t no coming back. Ain’t no trying to be badass with your godly strength as it seems you’re capable of knocking adult men off their feet right? Go cry me a river and stop being a fool and protecting criminals. Yes you have issue with bad gun owners so do we. You think we like anyone with a gun and just shoot randomly. We ain’t as fool as you make us to be tbf, you just throwing random assumptions like we are kids and somehow you’re the adult and the only sane person. From my personal experience, I have had the chance to blow the brains of maybe 4, and I just took the gun out and said “stop or I will shoot”. They usually end up running away from robbery attempts. And as a sane gun owner, somehow I didn’t shoot them in the back. But all those were attempts with knifes, if I have seen a gun, I wouldn’t say stop, I would shoot and let the court sort it out, it’s my word and my cameras vs a dead terrorists.
So sad to see this happening. Smaller incident happened here in Canada in August also
Never said I wouldn’t take him to the ground myself. It wouldn’t be that difficult lol. I think life is too precious to take over a destroyed window lol
No one’s life was in danger here. You’re trying so hard and getting so offended because I called out the stupidity of the idea of blowing someone’s brains out over a rock fest
Bro what lol
Okay, I did not expect this to turn into real life GTA.
classic loser victim wanting to get punished and do nothing about it
So you really think that old man could have gone to this what looks like 6ft+ dude and knock him down? Woooah you’re such r/iambadass You got laws to protect you for a reason, learn them and use them, don’t be like the average joe that has sheep mentality and think guns aren’t meant to protect you. When your life in danger, you gonna wish you had that shotgun that you kept talking shit about. Been their done that. Only reason we are alive is because my “classic gun owner” of an uncle horded guns like it’s the apocalypse. Even tho his government kept telling him “we gonna keep you safe” and all his friends and family told him the same.
So you think the owner of this house should have invited the guy over for some cold ones, maybe hang out sometimes as he seems stable enough right? The dude drove over him with a golf cart. You also think this is wrong? Let’s be honest here and just say you’re the moral failure of a human if you agree with such action to be gone unpunished. If the cops ain’t stopping him, I bet you a 9mm would, or in this case a golf cart. Gonna keep saying it my family, and myself safety comes first. Protect first, and ask questions later.
Whatever he did, fuck that guy but ordinary folks can't just mow people down. This ain't an episode of Dredd.
&gt; Classic gun owners salivating at the thought of murdering someoneOh, so you know the guy in the golf cart, huh?  What, you don't know him, you're just imposing your narrative on a situation you don't know any more about than anyone else here?  Oh, okay, got it.
I'm not too frail, YET, but that old fart in the golf cart looked like he might not be in top physical condition like the amazing specimen of muscularity that is me. And you seem to be fine with any people or pets in that house getting hit with 20 pound rocks and shattering window glass:  "Don't intervene with force, just stand to one side and open your phone's camera app like a proper citizen of the shitocracy!  Cops will come along later and take a report." It's time that we got rid of the toxic femininity that excuses violent criminals and says we ought to try to reason with them while they're assaulting us.  Inject just a little bit of male "big dick" energy back into our society, I'm tired of watching twinks surrender to out-of-control crimechads frankly.  I really enjoyed watching those store owners beating on those robbers with sticks.  It felt like taking a little bit back from the entitled shitheads who have been committing crimes, often violent or backed by violence or threats of violence, with near-zero consequences since the oddly-coincidental year of 2020.
Do you think that was the case here? Are you really that frail and afraid to go over to some old nut job and throw him to the ground? There are 100 steps in between intervention and killing the dude. Y’all really are psychotic people man. Hope y’all see that the world doesn’t need to be that way someday
It should be a legal shoot frankly.  People have been blinded, brain-damaged, even killed by dudes hurling rocks through windows.  Consider rocks to be Deadly Force and proceed from that point.
I'm hearing Will Ferrel's voice coming from under the golf cart:  "I'm alive, but I'm injured very very badly..."
Classic gun owners salivating at the thought of murdering someone for throwing rocks at windows
&gt;There are no lives in danger still in the hypothetical. I can’t be more clear on that. Breaking a window with no possible people to be harmed like I said in my hypothetical doesn’t involve any “violent criminals” breaking a window isn’t violent, it’s vandalism or destruction of property, but it’s not violent so confused where you’re getting that from.we're talking about what happened in the video right?or are you moving the goal posts?
Nobody read your hypothetical, nor cares. Someone throws a boulder into my family's home, being hit by a golf cart is the kindest thing he's going to face.
Seeing that golf cart roll up took me out just like it took that guy out 😆😆😭

my window is worth more than someone who's willing to endanger other people's lives.You can think that the world is a better place with violent criminals.I would disagree with you.
A fat guy on a golf cart is the calvary charge of the modern era.
Look at that 2.5mln as a percentage and compare to UK for instance
Right, I watched the video too. I posed a hypothetical with very specific parameters and your response was something to an entirely different hypothetical for some reason. Also very badass line. Cool cool.
Do you all not understand what “assuming there is no one that needs protecting on said property” means? The reading comprehension of this subreddit is astounding. I 100% would use lethal force to protect my child, that isn’t what I’m asking, I’m asking if protecting a window using lethal force is odd in a scenario without any children or people that could be harmed. “But what it there’s a kid” is not a counter to that it’s changing the entire premise and shifting the goal post.
Ok here’s not such a miniscule number. There are 2.5 million break ins in the US per year, so you think the law actually disincentivizes people? I kinda don’t, I’d imagine it makes more of them come armed though.
Do you not understand what “assuming there is no one that needs protecting on said property” means? There’s no baby in my hypothetical and it’s the dumbest counter because it completely changes the premise and shifts the goal post.
First of all, he didn't shoot anybody, and secondly, if someone was shooting, you better shoot first. Better to be judged by 12 than carried by 6.
Ah, you're right.  I was assuming no one was in the house, but the homeowner would be completely justified in any state under those circumstances.
Throwing heavy rocks blindly into a domicile where people are likely to be present? That's not property damage. It sounds more along the lines of some form of reckless endangerment with a lethal weapon.

The definition of deadly force is force that will likely cause death or severe bodily harm, the driver looked old, so he could be in fear, the suspect was volant, armed with a rock, and committing burglary or could be argued, I think the driver is ok.
Great distraction.
Why’s this not the top comment.
What causes a comment to disappear when I touch on it using iPhone? Has the user deleted their comment?
I thought he was gonna continue with putting a golf ball the guy's mouth and play some golf.
What are you going on about. Dude crushed him with a golf cart. I’m wondering if he’s alive as well.
In Indiana, it doesn't even have to be an occupied house. Just your house. If it's your car, it still needs to be occupied, but defending your own home from vandalism or destruction, even if it's not occupied by anyone, with lethal force is warranted. I don't have to wait for the window smasher to smash me or the arsonist to set me on fire to stop them in their tracks.
Fast to thing about killing someone, you are a moral failure
I’m really hoping this guy wasn’t suffering some sort of mental break because I would feel bad for laughing, which I did. Hard. Just as hard as I laughed the first time I saw it.

Plot twist: thwy crashed because if the live stream interfearing with the controls.
&gt;all 50 states have “stand your ground!”Nope. Colorado has the Castle Doctrine (Make My Day Law) but they do not have the Stand Your Ground law. Two completely different laws. In regards to your home the law extends to your vehicle as well. Your vehicle is an extension of your home as far as your personal property rights go and you may protect it as you would your home. The Castle Doctrine applies to both.
Yes I am yet there are facts and historical facts which you can't bend according to your/my agenda.As for what the dude wrote and I replied:Israelis are not illegal immigrants in \*\*Israel\*\*, they are citizens of their sovereign state which was recognized by the world and according to UN resolution for their right to have self determination and independence.&amp;#x200B;People such as this dude are the main reason we built our own country.
Driver is going to prison.
A home that size probably has a family living there. If I’ve got kids in a house and someone starts breaking windows I assume they are a threat to my family and I’m breaking out the Tactical Golf Cart first and asking questions later.
I love how he just stfu because you know he's never had kids.
I'm guessing you're not a parent.
I’m strangely aroused by Mr. Blue shirt/blue hat.  The back and forth motion of his chubby little muffin ass makes my loins tingle
Don't worry George Soros is thinking of the criminals!
Gotta love the "yeeaah" when dude got run over
I heard him mumbling “I’m sorry”.
Lmfao. GOTEM
Them duke boys getting air again.
He definitely said “I’m dying”. News article is wrong.
I have cats that sit by the windows, this dude would’ve gotten the same treatment or worse at my house.
Won't someone think of the criminals?!
This new PUBG mod is too realistic.
But I expected then that he land in the water with the golf cart. It actually was just 1 m left.
So essentially Texas has it's own version of stand your ground laws? Like I said? https://statutes.capitol.texas.gov/Docs/PE/htm/PE.9.htm#D
It’s the castle doctrine that applies here yes (assuming house was occupied) and it is not specific to Texas but all 50 states as it’s a castle law doctrine. (The United Kingdom as well). Now some states extend that castle doctrine to an occupied vehicle as well. All states have varying extents of stand your ground laws, too. It’s rare that both self defenders and murderers that claim self defense use the stand your ground laws as a defense, however, as it rarely ever applies.
MAGAs just being MAGAs
It's not. It's the Texas stand your ground/castle doctrine. Im still wrong though. Just read through it and property for "deadly" force does appear for night time. My mistake!
Completely irrelevant in this scenario as we’re talking about an occupied dwelling where all 50 states have “stand your ground!”Stand your ground laws (laws every state has to varying extents) have nothing to do with loss of property either.
Might want to look up the stand your ground law
There's mental illness, then there's violent mental illness. I don't get why people use this as some sort of excuse, "he's probably not right in the head, he didn't deserve that, he needs help!"I'd say every single person who commits violent crimes isn't right in the head.
You can and will be charged for using deadly force to protect property in Texas. The centuries old law you refer to is if it was at night time and there is no other way to retrieve that property. (The only place and only situation in the world where private citizens can explicitly use lethal force to protect property). This home was likely occupied, and so what the golf cart driver did would have been justified self defense in every state.Even still, you shouldn’t glorify killing anyone for (almost) any reason.
Are you a bit biased?
Only just over the amount of damage he caused not to mention all the stress and inconvenience for everyone.
I totally thought he was saying "I'm dying"
Third partied hardcore lol
"I'm sorry man"Did anyone else hear a little girl mumbling? What happened to the bad-man who threw a rock through the window? Where's he gone?Oh that's right, he's under the golf-cart whimpering like the coward he is.
Sometimes you just gotta take a step back and admire your work
No, it probably doesn’t.But the portion of mentally disabled/outsiders committing those type of crimes is minuscule. Your counter-argument, while a logical one, is simply too remote/with too-small a sample size to affect the actual argument
Yes, there is. And yes, it is.Look at UK vs US when it comes to crimes like burglaries
How the fuck did the car make it through with no broken glass
Yes it did. He’s going to jail for throwing rocks.
It’s the smushed “I’m sorry bro, i’m sorry” for me bois.
Then what happed?
Hear his lungs crushing when it rolls over him 💀
What if a baby was behind those windows where the rock fell into.
What if there’s not… like the hypothetical I posed. If you pose a different hypothetical, my answer will change. No I don’t think it’s odd to shoot someone to protect a baby, I find it odd to shoot a person over a window, like I’d call the cops and move to safety and prepare to defend myself if need be.
It was a brick through a window in this hypothetical, not a burglary/robbery. That’s a different fence post for sure. A home invasion is more than purely non life threatening property damage.
Do you think it deincentivizes people who have mental disabilities or are from somewhere else and don’t know the law?
I’m sure there are lots of stats that can be pulled up about whether [insert method or law] is an effective deterrence for [insert crime].
r/SuddenlyMultiplayer
What if there was a baby in that room, would it be justified then?  Also, he didn't take a life. But Rock guy had no such concerns.
Nope, not all. If you're smashing up my home when someone is there, it's reasonable to assume you are a threat to their lives...what if one of those bricks hits my 8 year old in the head?
In Texas, I can’t be charged for using deadly force to protect my property. Let’s hope they got the same rules.
I know that guy still has his shoes on but considering the size electric lime koolaid man who ran him over his chances of survival are slim
Does stand your ground cover using golf carts 🤔
I don't understand why this mantra is used so much, but not the reverse.Someone asks, "are those goods worth a human life?" to someone protecting their property.Knowing the consequences, why is it never posed the other way to would be thieves - is stealing those goods worth your life?  If not, don't steal them!
Didn't see a guy attempting murder. Where's he at?
No.
That river was getting close.
I find it a little barbaric but also a great way to disincentivise people
Caddy to the rescue xD
I've played gta missions like this. Vice city vibes
I thought that was Gabe Newell driving the golf car.
Awful title
Wow
Do you find it odd you can take a life over a window, assuming there is no one needing protecting on said property?
Ha, nice.
Depends on the state, where I am i can protect my property with a gun, or a golf cart. There could have been someone on the other side of that window, you don’t have to just sit and watch people break your shit.
coming soon to the sorted by Controversial section:"Running over him to make him stop was the wrong way to handle his mental illness problem."
They charged him a dap and a pound. The guy that got run over went to jail however
Doesn't mention what happened to the guy who tried to commit murder.
Did the homeowner get charged?  I mean, I don't blame him, but the law doesn't look kindly on assault and battery in response to property damage.
A dukes of hazard horn would’ve been perfect.
He's apologizing with what sounds like squishy lips. Seems like the only thing murdered here was his pride.

I just love the way the guy just gets out of the cart and looks down like he accidentally hit a squirrel.
Park it. Leave it there!
Great directions from offscreen lmao. He’s quick with it. THERE YA GO, brake on! Park it. leave it there, everyone stay back!Situation’s handled bud! That said did anyone else think that dude was in his 70s?
Ok fact police
Quote:   In the video, Vanderlinden can be heard underneath the cart saying “I’m sorry, bro. I’m sorry.”Lol.
An oldie but goodie!
Apparently Ollie was arrested a year earlier for a breakin. &amp;#x200B;https://www.ourquadcities.com/news/crime/man-hid-in-walgreens-then-stole-items-police-allege/
This happened in a nearby town. The guy threw rocks and broke a bunch of car windows in a parking lot and then moved on to nearby homes. The homeowner was not pleased and took matters into his own hands
$5000 bond?!?!?  That's all?Sheesh 🤦🏻‍♀️.Thanks for the link!
Why do theta always say “I’m sorry! I’m sorry!” after doing something stupid then getting wrecked?
It's because of the old silent comedy rule "If it's not on the screen, then the character can't see it"  Same reason [this clip](https://youtu.be/tJsfhxPMDu0) is always so funny.
[News story.](https://www.mystateline.com/news/weird/wanted-illinois-man-seen-terrorizing-town-arrested-after-being-ran-over-by-golf-cart/)
He was throwing bricks because he had some big emotions.Other guys are the neighborhood watch.Still have no source other than my imagination.
The motivation is more than likely a deep rooted desire to get run over by a golf cart.
Any idea *why* he was throwing bricks or the other guys are?
The last thing I was expecting was for someone to roll in on a golf cart, comedy gold
The dude in pink started throwing bricks through the owner's window. Owner said "not today bub."I have no source.
When you need someone run over you want a driver built like that
Any context for this?
Like me playing CODM and jumping in a jeep 😃
Big boy driver doubled the damage points on this one
That was a whole lotta weight pressed down on that guy
Naturally people edited out the part where she tried to murder the cop and spun this across Twitter as some innocent woman getting floored by the cop for no valid reason.
I like how the tone of your original comment is "😡" but your tone in the explanation is "😅"
Where is the causality? "and don't realize the harm it did to them." is isn't even conjecture it's 'let me pull a hypothesis from my behind fit fits my view points'-ing not a single fact was used to make that leap.
If I'm ever in South America, I'll have a gun ready every time I see a moped.
The fact that she thinks he's already dead and not just "hurt" is absolutely heart-wrenching. I have two young boys and my stomach hurts right now thinking of her fear and her emotions. Poor baby.
This mf in the white car can’t drive for shit
So sad.
The pilot called for the flaps to be lowered and instead the dude feathered the props.
Explaining causality doesn't equate to an excuse. They're pieces of shit, but it comes from somewhere, and it's probably not birth.
That was stupid
Do not justify. They chose this conciously.
Imagine being such a heartless monster you shoot someone in front of their kid
What kind of case did dude have on that phone? Holy shit. But in all seriousness, this was so horrible! Rip.
I hope they capture these two and do what’s right - burn them alive.
Super interesting from a linguistic standpoint, but kind of terrifying af in an awful dystopian way.  Guess we're on that right sub for that, haha.

I like Iran's policy of hanging people in public.  We shouldn't act like we are doing something shameful.  We should be proud to be delivering justice to murderers.

You have to be an incredible monster to try to kill a man in front of a kid
Damn, he handled that situation quick.
What a beast shook it off like it was nothing
Don't know how it is in your country, but in mine you'll get killed for the pettiest thing. You just don't try to resist or bargain, don't even look at them the wrong way and just give up whatever they want. In many cases they'll still hurt you or kill you anyway.
No, it kinda does, at least in LATAM. Here its common for people to get shot even after giving the robber their stuff, you can do everything the way they want and they still will hurt you in any way they want.
And remember: El único ladrón bueno es el ladrón muerto.
Poor girl crying “they killed Him” ☹️

Reminder that you're on a subreddit called terrifying as fuck.

If it was a hit, it wouldn't be with a small caliber pistol at point blank range and a shot to the leg.

How do these robbers live like this? You can’t tell me any somewhat right minded person can shoot a father in front of their kid, not take anything, leave off. And then go home to their own family without losing their mind?
Awww she was crying, "I'm sorry Poppy " 😞
Would *slightly* contradict the idea of justice.
r/watchpeoplesurvive
LOL. Nice creative writing and history revision there kid.
No, there isn't.
Other people were saying it was a hit, and I could see it.But its definitely more likely to just be a robbery.
average day in latin america unfortunately. Used to be this times a hundred per day, in cities like caracas.
Damn that kid is gonna remember that forever. Imagine a core memory is of your father getting shot in front of you.
You are seriously overthinking a basic robbery sir
&gt;once it happens to them or their family.So you mean that if I'd be in the most subjective place, having as far away as a coherent thinking as possible, I'd end up having such a stupid opinion that it becomes the same as yours?And you thought it would convince me that it's a good opinion or something?Why do you think the victim is not the judge? My god, Germany clearly has people just as stupid as in any country.
I would assume they go back to their favela trap house and do drugs.
Fucking animals. Castrate em
If you decide to break the law to make money there are a billion ways to go about it before you need to be shooting people in front of their little daughters. Guy wasn't even carrying anything expensive. It is possible loss of life and guaranteed lifelong trauma for what, a smartphone? The smallest possible reward you can get from a crime besides shoplifting a pack of chewing gum.And with that trigger discipline the girls life was just as in danger as her mental health.It's extra infuriating because you basically go out of your way to be extra scum with not even any meaningful payout expected.
It's not being politically correct to not wish for torturous death, it's just not being a fucking psychopath. So tired of being surrounded by primitive cavemen and their equally stupid upvoters.
Maybe he couldnt do it in front of the kid so he tried to get the artery so he bled out.
Part of the problem is many of the people that do this grew up watching their dad's and uncles and brothers and cousins getting gunned down and don't realize the harm it did to them.
He' sure is making positive that the package is in one piece isn't he??? Peace
Y sus líderes los hacen peor..Except for Bukele, he seem to get it
Kill them all..Growing around those fuckers, getting robbed at gun point more than once, beat up and cut because sometimes you didn’t have anything from the to steal from you..Burn them all and let God sort them out.
Why is nobody pointing out the shot seems like an accident. Bad trigger discipline. Which explains why the thieves gtfo without taking anything. Seems like a panic response. Otherwise this makes no sense.
So nice of that woman to come and and help.
That's why I am pro death setence (German here). People who are against it just never really thought about it and would instantly change their mind once it happens to them or their family. Fucking hypocrites.
Fucking coward pieces of shit
How's work go today?Not bad. One failed robbery, mostly success.
Better sentence? That came out of nowhere. Yes, we all know there is a major artery in the leg. Yes, we know that shots in the extremities can kill. But we're talking about intent. People who shoot other people in the leg at such a close range aren't doing it with the intent of murder, regardless of whether or not a leg shot can kill you.
What a piece of shit.
what kind of life do u need to have lived to be so disregarding of someone else
This is fucked. Fuck those thieves to hell.
. Stay strong brotha 💪🏽 you survived this tragedy 🙏
That was unnecessary and morally so wrong.I hope the child gets all the help that she needs to get over it.This is heartbreaking stuff. Goddamn it
Oh no
I hope they rot in a cell while being tortured and begging for them to stop.  Im sorry but this is unhumane. Im sorry i went on a rant there but this is just disgusting and evil.   Good job this father is a hero.
I understand you have major arteries there lol. However, that is not a “hit”
Putting aside the fact that you shouldn’t rob people at all what kind of fucking pricks rob a guy at gunpoint when he’s walking with his young daughter. The lack of the smallest amount of decency in the people in this world make me sick at times.
I think you’re confused about what “politically correct” means. Perhaps you mean “fuck the justice system”?
&gt; The little girl’s screams alerted a woman in the nearby house.Not the gunshot?
Looks like the dumb mfkr has his finger on the trigger while he was waving it around, and negligently discharged it
This is tragic dude
I see sarcasm isn't popular here.
Shoot a guy in the leg and hit an artery, you might get a better sentence because "you weren't aiming to kill"?
It's weird, language bending to an algorithm.
There is a Special place in hell …..
It's Ecuador! Educate yourself!
robbers thought they where in gta5, really what was that melee combat lol
Loved the weak attempt at a pistol whip before the incompetent thief gave up and had to shoot the unarmed man to maintain dominance, how pathetic
Oh lol it's cause I'm used to writing it like that now cause in places like IG you can't really type this stuff fully or my comment will be "hidden" or give a thing that says to check what I'm saying 😅 so kinda had to work around it ha
I hate a fucking thief
Did the robbers get caught?
take my upvote.. dammit
![gif](giphy|KD8Vy3ODBhoaoCOR8u|downsized)
The random Korean letters in your comment lol
It's like why shoot? Especially after the fact they didn't end up taking anything
Idk man. I’d say early to mid 30s
So lucky! From what I can see, looks like that came close to his femoral artery.
Thank you L for your input
Países de mierda
I agree with your sentiment (hitman puts 2 in his head) but you have major arteries and veins in your upper thighs.He's lucky one or the other didn't get clipped because he'd bleed out in 15 seconds.
Pure fucking evil.
Instead of brazing bull i would use judas cradle or Breaking Wheel (i think it was called like that)
Thank f the father lived.  Heartbreaking watching that.
It wasn’t quite shitty to begin with. Tourism brought many people to the equator and the Galapagos, now influx of violence and corruption has fucked up a perfectly good industry in what was a pretty decent country. Before the cartels took over, when was the last time you heard anything about Ecuador? Exactly.
Or the Breaking wheel
Yea. That would be enough
At the point I start mugging people with a gun and shoot them infront of their kid.
If the outside forces become inside forces then that makes the country shittier
Omg I just searched that up - fuck!I was thinking the Brazen Bull would be a nice place for those pieces of shit
Yes. The banality of evil
r/Iamatotalpieceofshit
Lol a hit would not aim one shot at the upper thigh my man
What kind of evil demonic person sees a man and his small child walking with nothing but the clothes on their back. What a dumbass tragic decision. “yeah dude let’s get this guy solely to traumatize these two for the rest of their lives.
wow so people don't murder and steal in your country? where excatly do you live?
Poor kid
Based, total violent criminal death today 2024
God damn they're fucking stupid, how did they fuck up robbing someone?
Another comment says they were demanding his phone. I think you can see the glint of it in the shooter's other hand right after he shoots.
Tell me you know nothing about firearms and ammo without....
Poor girl, screaming "they killed him"
Wasn’t sure what this was so I looked it up. Oh boy.
It’s time for The brazen bull
“What often occurs is that cartel cell groups in the United States will recruit US citizens to purchase weapons for them,” Again, even in your source. Mexican cartels travel to the US illegally purchase them, and illegally transport them across the border back into Mexico.
Ecuador wasn’t even a THOUGHT in our heads before the cartels moved in. People are quick to call places shit-hole countries without even considering the fact that outside forces directly degraded the standard of living.
Because they happen frequently in certain parts of the world. A guess at best.
How do you think it’s a hit?
Never trust two guys on a moped if you are in Latin America.
I don’t know about a hit, the dude purposely shot him in the leg.. maybe a threat to fear the local gang but clearly wasn’t shooting to kill.. if I had to guess, the robber got jumpy when the thwap to the head didn’t deter the guy and he shot him to make sure he could get away
But shot him in his leg?
And it's the Mexican cartels that are illegally buying and selling them.
Was this a hit gone wrong or a robbery? Any context would be appreciated…. Shooting anyone is wrong especially in front of their child.
Nah not really only in brazil and such
America uniquely the only country to make firearms
They stole his phone. The thief is saying "Give me the phone. Give me the phone or I'll shoot you"
Any 1st world country without free guns policy in mind?
I'm happy I found this here
Death by a thousand cuts!
Just bring back judas cradle and use it on him
Shit hole planet
He is trying to stay calm for his daughter. ☹️
That wasn't a robbery. they didn't take anything. Sounds more like a hit...
Robbery that was a hit. That guy had planned on killing him before they even moved towards him
After this do they go home to their wife and kids and act normal like they didn't just traumatized a child and family?! Fuㄷking sㄷum bags
For real!
Fuck being politically correct. Anyone who shoots anyone in front of their kid should die the worst death possible.
That woman is 💯
What the fuck happened
There was a huge brawl in Calgary for the same reasons. Don’t bring your civil war to a different country that has nothing to do with the issue.
Man kicked while she was down and launched a few feet lmao
That’s indigenous Jewish land colonized by Arabs, so what’s good for the goose I guess. Hilarious comment given the homogeneous, insular, and plain racist state of every Arab nation that exists.
It went silent so quickly...
Absolutely clobbered her with that kick lolPlay stupid games.
holy shit, that fire scene was just devastating.
Good

fuck
Christ that really is terrifying as fuck
YupI don’t know anything about the situation, but the people that love how things are done where they came from, to the point of physically assaulting the people that fled for the opposite reason, can, should and must go fucking back the way they came
Ha
Those damn Propagandists. After a quick google search, your right. Israel has never done anything wrong. Ever. Period. https://youtube.com/shorts/IFgWO7gqE54?si=4vPHdm9ZhDji80GUhttps://youtube.com/shorts/7uL555xWQeE?si=U6ypo2L0sW_ocbAuhttps://youtu.be/VZ4ppVnBjM4?si=IEpnVZOYyIsXhYzzhttps://youtu.be/5iX0x2ezRnU?si=MNF3cTq-z9X-YsQphttps://youtu.be/KMcj1fPTQ3E?si=pxy62LTDZN4zQ3qdhttps://youtube.com/shorts/F5JAQUtPFVQ?si=SajxoyCYQCYwgwZZhttps://youtube.com/shorts/EChcxGBeJJo?si=46iTwzmG6rERnohWhttps://youtube.com/shorts/vio53jUpJz0?si=JsjK3QvKQZlTleX2
It was part of Ethiopia until 1993.
The only two countries in the world who recognized Jordanian rule over the West Bank were Pakistan and UK.And here is how Israel ended up with it:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six-Day\_War

Shut up, nerd.
"foreign nationals from Eritrea"The politically correctness aight?
You too!
I won't, you can go to another post. Bye!
It seems you watch too much propaganda, Israel has 2 million Arab Muslim citizens, some are judges in the supreme court, other are parliament members, some are doctors or business owners. "Arab Israelis" live by far better than most Arabs in the Middle East.
That’s crazy. Israelis have no problem shooting down Palestinians but they’ll let these two groups go at it
I'm sure Israel's government won't put up with this bs as long as Sweden
Shut up nerd.
Fuck Israel anyway
This doesn’t refer to them as “illegals”.  So, you’re the only one here referring to them by that term. They’re “asylum seekers”.  Seeking asylum is not usually a crime. Are you saying it is a crime in Israel? Thank you.
Get shields you idiots.
The far right “deport everyone” parties.
I don't know much about the region, but looking at a map, it looks like the West Bank used to be part of Jordan. How did Israel end up with it?
Gangs of ny shit
Good old fashioned mob violence

Gotta love that cultural enrichment
Red vs Blue only real life and mean.
![gif](giphy|d1E1msx7Yw5Ne1Fe|downsized)No.
Maybe they are the real problem
Why does the title refer to them as “illegals”? No credible news source makes this claim.
Israelis are illegal immigrants in Palestine
Maybe because you’re ignorant?
How do you know they're illegals? Israel has a large population of legal immigrants and refugees from Eritrea
Is that a "no"?
how appropriate and reasonable!
In Switzerland too, just yesterday: https://www.blick.ch/schweiz/zuerich/video-zeigt-massenschlaegerei-in-opfikon-zh-id18904525.html
I see that you are sad, maybe you can help with shelter to those poor people?
What the hell are you talking about? What genocide dude?I live with Arab Muslims all my life and I speak Arabic fluently. You guys just make assumptions based on what?
Most Israelis never stole homes and lands, they purchased it with their best money and they live in a country which has more than 2 million Arab Muslim citizens with full rights.While in Palestinian Authorities jews can't even enter because they will be lynched by the mob or will be taken as hostages by Palestinian terrorist leaders (Hamas for example, is not so different than ISIS).
No, the dude on the motorcycle is "ambulance volunteer" - they are group of paramedics who volunteer and they usually reach places before anyone else to provide first aid.
Canadians rioting.
I watched again...It does only look like a "look at me" light like tow trucks or road construction trucks have.  The bike being yellow... and the light not being red &amp; blue.  Certainly not dressed like a cop or some sort of government employee.Doesn't look at all like what came up when I web searched "israel police motorcycle"Maybe he's delivering cous cous?
haha this sub was so insanely racist back then. still is, but it was back then, too.
&gt;Your motive is "they're practically parasites anyways, so who cares if they get thrown against a wall and shot"Pretty sure that's the definition of a straw man. You're telling him what his position is and then reacting to that invented position.The only thing the dude has said is that if the Ertrean's don't like the circumstances in Israel, they're welcome to seek refuge somewhere else.
What are pro-government Eritreans doing illegally in Israel? If they're willing to fight for that oppressive regime, why didn't they stay there?
About time they released TF3.
It’s because 99% of the time it is a right wing antisemitic conspiracy theory
They're doing this crap in Edmonton and Toronto, too. In Edmonton, a kids' soccer game was canceled. In Toronto, some sort of a festival was canceled.  Like, go the f home and deal with those issues.
Lmao they couldn't just keep the squabble in eritrea tho
I'm not sure he was just a pizza delivery guy. He did have a flashing light on the back too.
lmao the obvious bias in the title is both funny and very, very sad.
If you can dodge a wrench...
Yep that's definitely how you settle a political debate! Some excellent points made by both sides. The Eritrean Government is on standby waiting for the result of the debate.
Good thing everyone wears a uniform
An illegitimate refugee falsely claiming asylum to gain entry to a host nation? How far fetched! This must just  be another right wing antisemitic conspiracy theory fueled by online misinformation which can only be combatted by a biometric digital id enforced by a global NGO
The soil is magic where they’re going and the problems they suffer back at home will solve themselves
All for people getting involved in politics/government and making their opinions heard… in the country in question.Go hash this shit out in Eritrea, jerks
I see a red spy among the blus already disguised
Nope that’s all ur problem bro
This is happening a lot in western cities. Kinda feels like a destabilization campaign.
No, ya see its not tolerating any one line of thinking is bad. All sides must be debated peacefully or head back home to chop each others arms off
For a country stolen from Arabs and “founded” by mostly eastern European “Hebrew” immigrants Israel xenophobes pretty damn hard.
the anti-government are actual refugees, the pro-government just piggyback on the refugee status, but they are in europe and israel as work migrants.
the protest by blue was actually approved by the police, so the yellows are ushers.
They are lost French protesters
Is that a pizza delivery guy riding right through the middle of the whole thing with out a single worry? (starting at 1:12)That is so frickin' awesome.
Lol I live in ethiopia (thier neighbor) I did not know they were divided like this. I didn't think there wond be any pro government at all. But damn ours is worse...imagine this but with ethnic underlining plus there is probably more than 80 ethnicities together.
Nice of them to wear uniforms like that
Ok you will try to prove I posted fake news or ok you understand now that my posts are informative reports that include **only** date, the involved and location?
Prove that any of my posts is fake, or remain silent if you can't.All my posts include time, place and who involved and without my personal comment but a clear informative report.Prove that I faked.
I have to wonder if the pro-government guys faked the whole refugee status thing.  Normally it's the government that the refugees are trying to escape.
Why bother Tel Aviv with this though?  The homeland is calling these patriots to return and pick up the struggle where it counts.  Doing it in a safe place like Tel Aviv smacks of Slacktivism.  I imagine both sides could use these healthy young men of fighting age to settle their struggle on the front in Eritrea.
&gt;illegalsLike the Israelis in the West Bank?
Same. Everyone can be a bad person. Fuck skincolor and if poor or rich.
Honesty it’s gotten a bit more tame over the years. But when I first joined (which I think was near its inception around the George Floyd riots because the og sub was censoring post) there was some WILD shit being said here. I’m just here for the crazy videos and dislike everyone equally.
Correct also this sub usually likes to shit on PoC people even if they are victims. Colored people fighting for their freedom = bad. Colored people getting hit = good.
Yea I mean I wasn’t suprised I’d get downvoted since this sub is right leaning and has a more pro Israeli bias (again I don’t care either way or have an opinion on whose right or wrong) just stating a fact that people in Israel aren’t unfamiliar with hatred.
Thats why people who are pro regime should fuck off. If I were to leave a dictator ridden country behind that only cared for himself and not the people, I wouldnt be happy with the people who support him/it. This can be anything and about anyone: like Assad? Then fuck off and stay under his power. Like Putin? Same shit etc.
Something similar happened in Israel recently
I'd never even heard of a country called Eritrea and suddenly Eritreans are everywhere.
soft disarm chief muddle memory absurd grandfather reminiscent school versed ` this message was mass deleted/edited with redact.dev `
Lol idc either way. I’m just saying it’s not like Israel isn’t already a place that’s had blood shed on it consistently for thousand plus years. From both sides. Just makin a dumb joke. Nvm: your whole post history and identity clearly shows your bias on this matter so what’s the point lol
who won?
There should be a rule that you should be deported if you are a simp for the dictatorial/authoritarian government of the country you left.
If they don't like the shelter that Israel gave them (they do and they appreciate it), they can move to your beautiful country and you can invite them for dinner.
Tbf there is a lot of anger and hatred in Israel. They’ll fit right in
Wait so these guys are rioting in: Israel, +Sweden, Germany and Canada, over shit going on in Eritrea? WTF?
Motherfuckers took Red vs Blue way too seriously.
“Team Fortress 2 is so fun” Team Fortress 2:
Something similar happened on the moon recently
Something similar happened in Eritrea recently.
They're doing it all over Europe at the moment. Dumb fucks.
Something similar happened in Sweden recently.
They should leave the anger and hatred back where they came from, it's probably one of the major factors in leaving their homes in the first place.
Something similar happened in Germany recently https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBvuQKfU01Y
Who are the yellow shirts? The referees?
Something similar happened in Toronto recently.
